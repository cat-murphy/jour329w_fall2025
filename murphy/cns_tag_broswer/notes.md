# cns tag browser — cat murphy, sept. 30

## data exploration

omg these tags are awful. my student newspaper was like this with the insane tags, including my personal favorite: https://quchronicle.com/tag/dontmiss/. but seriously like what is going on here. exploring the data with sqlite shows an insane level of inconsistency — "Donald Trump," "president trump," "President Donald Trump," "Donald J. Trump." i ran the command again with limit 20 and discovered "new trump," "#NewTrump," "DonaldTrump," "president elect donald trump" and "president-elect trump." like. oh my god.

not to mention the fact that there are, for some reason, two tags that, at least from my command line, look identical: "Baltimore" and "Baltimore." i ran the original command again with limit 20, and "Baltimore" is listed twice ... does one have a space or something on the website???

the thing that really gets me is, like, the lack of uniformity. the terrible, random tags aside, the duplicates are killing me. trump is a good example, but there are doubles and triples and quadruples of everything — even "CNS TV," "cnstv," "cns maryland" and "CNS." i did a search for "Ravens" and got "baltimore ravens," "ravens," "former ravens player" and "ravens logo." like oh my goddddddddddddddddddd. there needs to be a tag bank.

## planning

**how i would want to search:** i mean ... i'd want a search bar. but that's only really helpful if i know exactly what i'm looking for, which i might not, ya know? so i would also want to in some way be able to browse by category (caTAGory?).

**what i would want displayed prominently:** well, with there being over 1,000 tags, you can't just have them all ... ya know ... listed or something. i would want the most-used tags displayed most prominently. it would automatically show you the top 10 most-used tags, but you could click a "show more" button to expand the list.

**how i would want the tags sorted:** by popularity. but also, i would want any tags with fewer than, i don't know, five?? articles assigned to it to be automatically excluded from the main dataset. like, you can add them back in, but i want them automatically filtered out. ooh, or you could put in a limit — like, oh i only want to look at tags with more than 50 articles.

**what filters i would want:** i would want to be able to filter (or browse) by categories like:

* maryland
* government & politics
* health & climate
* sports
* culture

this is kind of just a cursory look at what i would want as broad categories, but i would want these to have subdirectories by topic as well — so, like, politics would break into state government, federal government, education, courts. sports by league, level. i think i want a maryland subdirectory for locations and very maryland-specific things, but i'm not sure. just spitballing.

**other features i would want:** i would want a feature where you could paste a headline and it could use ai to suggest tags. i would want every tag listed to be hyperlinked to the cns page. in a crazy world, if copilot could maybe do this, i would want it to pull and list the 10 most recent headlines listed under that tag, and the most recent date it was used. if that were possible (the date thing) i would also want to be able to view *recent* popular tags. like, most used tags over the last month or whatever. but it would need to scrape that lol, so i doubt it.

## using copilot

i started, off the bat, with this:

```
write code in the index.html file that makes the tags in tags.json searchable and sortable. i want a search bar at the topic, and the main page should display the names of the top 10 most-used tags by count. the names of each tag should be hyperlinked with the cnsmaryland.org link associated with that tag. there should be a button below this called "show more" that when clicked will expand the list to show the next 10 most-used tags. there should also be a "show all" button that will open a popout with a scrollable list to the right. that popout should be sortable by count or alphabetical. there should also be a filter to exclude all tags with a count below five. i also want a directory below that. that directory should make the tags browsable by topic. use the topics in topics.csv to categorize the tags by name. put any that cannot be cleanly categorized under a topic called "miscellaneous." if you aren't sure about where a tag goes, ask. within that directory, each topic category, when clicked, should display a scrollable dropdown menu that displays the top 10 most-used tags under that topic by count. there should then be a "show more" button beneath the top 10 that will, when clicked, display a popout with the entire list of tags.
```

it didn't work ... at all. i got a webpage with all of the features i asked for *in theory*, but the tags weren't visible. i figured my first prompt was too confusing. i added that i wanted it to split up my js and css, and then i told it:

```
none of the tags from tags.json are visible on the webpage. please make sure they're categorized by topic using the topics.csv file for reference.
```

it took forrrrrrreeeeevvvvvvvvvver for it to read the json. i don't really know why it didn't read it before????

and yet, it still didn't work. told it it didn't work — twice. still nothing, so i gave up and started over.

i gentle parented it. i tried over and over. it still didn't work. 

at this point, even though the red sox won, i *started to actually cry* because i'm so stressed out and i've been working on this for hours but i'm apparently too stupid to even get a computer to do something for me.

so i switched models. and it still didn't work. just kept giving me a directory listing that did not include a single tag. 

i copied the transcript into a google doc and closed out the chat. i tried again. it gave me a website that gave me a directory listing and a tags listing, and when you clicked the tag listing, it showed you, like, 10. promising! but i told it that i wanted all of the tags, and its "fix" made none of them visible.

started over and tried again, this time copying the data over to a new folder in a new subdirectory under my cns_tag_browser directory. it FINALLY worked.

but at this point i don't really care that it worked because i have a tension headache from crying, and i feel like a complete moron.

but when i stop caring, i start fucking around. i got it to put everything into a serif font and to display tags in descending order by count, and only show the top 10 by default with a "show more" button. but then:

``` 
can you make it more visually appealing? what suggestions do you have?
```

it gave me a selection of ideas and asked if i wanted it to implement a "modern, elegant style," to which i responded:

```
do what you think is best!
```

looked great, honestly. just a couple things:

```
the search bar is a little too big for the container its in
```
```
can we add some more color? i'm personally a big fan of coral
```

priorities, people, priorities. 

*(it was around this time that i stopped crying and started having fun again. i still don't know why it took my hamster brain this long to get it to work.)*

i also tried to get it to put the maryland flag in the background, but it didn't work and i don't have the capacity to care:

```
hmm, can we go back to just the coral? make it elegant, but fun.
```

ok, now that i've stopped having a complete mental breakdown, i'll go back to doing real work, i guess.

```
i'd like to add another type of search function. i want to be able to browse the tags by topic. i need you to look at the topics in topics.csv and categorize all the tag using those topics. if there are any stragglers, put "miscellaneous"
```

it created a good dropdown menu, but all the menu options returned no results — i.e. nothing was actually categorized. i told it that and it fixed it. then it told me to let it know if i wanted to refine the UI ...

```
what do you think would be helpful for users with the UI?
```

it gave me 10 suggestions, everything from responsive design and keyboard accessibility to highlight search matches and show tag topic in the table. i told it to do all of it lol.

while it cooked on the design front, i went and looked at how it categorized the tags ... and, um. let's just say it categorized "education" under "Animals," "Gov. Martin O'Malley" under "Arts & Culture," and "Donna Edwards" under "Armed Forces and National Security." meanwhile "Politics" was "miscellaneous"

yeah ... so. not so great.

i asked about its categorization and it told me it couldn't get me a list of miscellaneous tags because there were too many. then i asked it to count the miscellaneous ones. that failed. then i asked it to remove the miscellaneous tags, and i had to fix my phrasing, but eventually i got it to recategorize all the miscellaneous ones to the best of its ability ... which wasn't very good. "CNS TV" is Agriculture and Food, apparently. so is "Donald Trump" — and just about every other politician, for that matter. 

i told it to recategorize any CNS ones into their own category, and i told it this:

```
also, Donald Trump is a politician. in fact, almost all of the things you have listed under agriculture and food are people, usually politicians. go back through those and, if its a person's name, think about whether it should be categorized in "Maryland Government and Politics" or "Federal Government and Politics"
```

then all the politicians were categorized as CNS ...

i tried for a while to get it to work, but it wasn't happening. so i gave it my categories instead — and it handled those a lot better. perfect? not even close. it would need a lot more parameters. but better. i tried to get it to fix some of it, but then it coded "Russia" as "Maryland" and "Maryland" as "Sports"

i played around with it some more, but not with much to report back on. kind of got nowhere with that.

but! then i had it add a tag similarity feature. we had some back-and-forth — it kept doing things in the most literal and least effective ways possible. i know, i know, clear prompts. it's late, man. but eventually i landed on another column that has dropdowns for each tag to show the top 5 similar tags. it was a little frustrating how long it took to get this correct and functional, but i eventually did.

i tried to add a filter by count (so, for tags with 100+, 50-99, 10-49, 0-9) but it kept screwing the entire thing up.

next, i used the cns_maryland_posts.json to add a "last six months" category to show how many times each tag has been used in the last six months. this took some serious debugging, but eventually it worked.

then i did this:

```
next, can you add a column that pulls the five most recent headlines (written as title in the cns_maryland_posts.json) and puts them in a dropdown menu for each tag? include the date of the post in (mm/dd/yyyy) format. put it to the right of the topic column.
```

this prompt was specific enough that it worked instantly, which was really cool. 

also did:

```
can you add two more columns to the right of last six months that say the date of the first time that tag was used and the most recent time it was used in (mm/dd/yyyy) format
```

also worked immediately, which was doubly cool considering how few brain cells i have.

it didn't really work the way i intended it to because of the limitations of that data set. thats ok, though. still cool that it could do it.

## thoughts


### what surprised me about working with copilot?

i mean, i already knew going in that copilot is pretty spectacular at coding, so long as you’re pretty specific about what you want. the thing that surprised me — though i suppose it really shouldn’t at this point — was the extent to which i’m an idiot LOL. this entire thing was so frustrating and it’s now 1 a.m. when i’m writing this because i spent so long trying to get it to work AT ALL. it took me starting over, oh, i don’t know, like eight times??? i don’t know — i guess i was just surprised that i ran into so many b issues. once i got it working, though, the results were pretty awesome. granted, there were times where i ultimately couldn’t get it to do something i wanted, but in general it could execute my commands without a problem.


### which prompts worked best for getting useful suggestions?

i think straight up asking it for advice was the most helpful for soliciting suggestions. i did this for a lot of dumb shit, like asking it how it thought i could make in the interface better. but it was also helpful when i would say things more along the lines of “i want this,” giving it an idea of what i wanted without telling it how i wanted it to accomplish it. because then it would typically respond with something like “i can do this, this, or this. which would you like to try?” so, like, when i asked it to create a hover-activated sidebar for suggested tags, it did exactly that and it was clunky. when i told it “i want to be able to explore these tags” and asked if it could try adding a new column, it gave me three ways it could accomplish that and i got to pick. and while there was more chatting involved with this method, it almost always required less debugging.

### what was frustrating or challenging?

- derek, this entire thing was frustrating. it literally made me cry. nothing i did at first would create a working website. every webpage would be either a directory listing or a polished table with no tags in it. i was losing my mind. but once i got it working, the most challenging piece was the debugging. so many things would almost work … but not. the frustrating part was the back and forth — telling it do something multiple times, it telling me it did that, me telling it i still can’t see it. even then, it didn’t always solve the issue. the filter by count function, for example, which i wanted to show me tags based on which tags had 100+ arches, 0-9 articles, etc., just wouldn’t work. first, it seemed to work but the filters didn’t have any data attached to them. then, it inserted a block of plain code above the table that i couldn’t get it to remove. then the entire table crashed and i had to go back to a previous checkpoint. i tried troubleshooting, but it just wouldn’t work, which was frustrating because it knew what i wanted, it just couldn’t execute and i couldn’t get it to debug itself.

### how would i change my approach next time?

i would switch undergrads and get a degree in animal behavior and cognition from hampshire college. ok no. but maybe. no, i think the biggest thing would be that i wouldn’t have started with such a giant, detailed prompt. it seemed to fuck up the entire process for a while. i should have started with something more simple, like a basic “using html, javascript and css, build me a website that makes the tags in tags.json searchable and sortable.” i tried using this prompt early on, but it was like it was confused by everything i had already done. eventually, though, this prompt did work — reinforcing my thought that i probably should have just started with it. i think i also would have played around a little more with the prompt settings. i wish i had given it all the context at once instead of having to continuously upload it, which i would sometimes forget to do and then it would create new problems. (granted, it was also frustrating that it didn’t have the capacity to be like, “looks like you didn’t upload any context files.”) maybe next time i would start by telling it what i wanted and soliciting suggestions on how to accomplish that — it worked pretty well when i asked for ui advice, so i wonder if that would have smoothed out some of the wrinkles early on. i also would probably start with a different model. ultimately i stuck with gpt 4.1, but i repeatedly tried to switch because nothing wasn’t working and i ended up back where i started. but i would have liked to try gpt 5 mini, because for the brief period that i tried using it, it seemed to be a lot more collaborative and explanatory. finally, i would taken a break and come back to it when it made me want to throw my computer out my 13th story window, rather than what i actually did, which was get really stressed and start crying.

Using "Apply Patch"


```

```
A new file `tags_browser.html` has been created in cns_tag_broswer. It loads the tags from tags.json (now embedded as a JS variable), and provides a searchable and sortable table by tag name using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

You can open this file in your browser to use the tag browser. If you want to include all tags, you can paste more of the tags.json data into the `tags` array in the script section.

Made changes.

: no, i want you to use all of the tags

GitHub Copilot: Using "Apply Patch"


```

```
The tag browser now loads all tags dynamically from tags.json using JavaScript's `fetch`. This means it will display and allow searching/sorting of the entire dataset, no matter how large tags.json is.

To use:
1. Start a server in the cns_tag_broswer directory (e.g., `uv run python -m http.server 8000`).
2. Open `http://localhost:8000/tags_browser.html` in your browser.

You will see all tags, searchable and sortable by name, using the real data from tags.json.

Made changes.

: forget everything i said. look at the data in tags.json and, using html, javascript and css, make me a webpage that makes them searchable and sortable

GitHub Copilot: Created [](file:///workspaces/jour329w_fall2025/murphy/cns_tag_broswer/index.html)

A new file `index.html` has been created in cns_tag_broswer. This webpage loads all tags from tags.json and allows you to search and sort them by name or count.

- Open `index.html` in your browser (after starting a server in this directory).
- You can search tags, and click the column headers to sort by name or count.

Let me know if you want to adjust the columns, add more features, or change the style!

Made changes.

: ok, first, put everything into a serif font. second, display the tags in descending order by count by default, and only display the top 10 most-used tags. include a "show more" button that shows the next 10 each time it is clicked.

GitHub Copilot: Using "Apply Patch"


```

```
The tag browser now uses a serif font, displays only the top 10 tags by count (descending) by default, and includes a "Show More" button to reveal 10 more tags each time it is clicked. Sorting and searching will also reset to showing 10 results at a time.

Open `index.html` in your browser to see the updated behavior. Let me know if you want further adjustments!

Made changes.

: can you make it more visually appealing? what suggestions do you have?

GitHub Copilot: Here are some suggestions to make the tag browser more visually appealing:

1. Add a card or panel background with a subtle shadow for the table.
2. Use alternating row colors for better readability.
3. Add hover effects to the table rows and the "Show More" button.
4. Use a more elegant color palette (e.g., soft blues, grays, or earth tones).
5. Add spacing and rounded corners to the table and button.
6. Make the search bar and button larger and more prominent.
7. Add a header or banner with a background color.
8. Use smooth transitions for hover/focus effects.
9. Add a subtle animation when new rows appear.
10. Consider using icons for sorting arrows.

Would you like me to implement a modern, elegant style with some of these suggestions? If you have a preferred color palette or style (e.g., minimal, playful, professional), let me know! Otherwise, I’ll apply a clean, modern look.

: do what you think is best!

GitHub Copilot: Using "Apply Patch"


```

```
The tag browser now features a modern, elegant look:
- Card-style panel with shadow and rounded corners
- Soft blue/gray color palette
- Alternating row colors and smooth hover effects
- Larger, more prominent search bar and button
- Responsive design for mobile

Open `index.html` in your browser to see the improved appearance! Let me know if you want further tweaks or features.

Made changes.

: the search bar is a little too big for the container its in

GitHub Copilot: Using "Apply Patch"

The search bar is now narrower, centered, and fits better within the container. Refresh the page to see the improved layout. Let me know if you want further adjustments!

Made changes.

: can we add some more color? i'm personally a big fan of coral

GitHub Copilot: Using "Apply Patch"


```

```
The tag browser now features coral as the main accent color—for the header, button, table header, and highlights—giving it a vibrant, friendly look. Refresh the page to see the new style! Let me know if you want to fine-tune the color usage or add more visual elements.

Made changes.

: hmm. can you make the background the maryland flag? i provided an image for you. make it slightly more transparent, though — it's got a LOT going on, and i don't want it to be too distracting.

GitHub Copilot: Created [](file:///workspaces/jour329w_fall2025/murphy/cns_tag_broswer/md-flag.png)

Using "Apply Patch"


```

```
The Maryland flag is now set as a softly blurred, semi-transparent background for your tag browser. The content remains readable and visually appealing. Refresh the page to see the effect! Let me know if you want to adjust the opacity, blur, or any other aspect.

Made changes.

: hmm, doesn't look like I can see the flag?

GitHub Copilot: Using "Apply Patch"


```

```
The background image path is now fixed. The Maryland flag should now appear (soft and semi-transparent) behind your content. Please refresh the page to see the flag. Let me know if you need further adjustments!

Made changes.

: hmm, can we go back to just the coral? make it elegant, but fun.

GitHub Copilot: Using "Apply Patch"


```

```
The background is now a playful, elegant coral gradient—no Maryland flag, just a fun and modern coral theme. Refresh the page to see the new look! Let me know if you want to tweak the colors or add more visual flair.

Made changes.

: the bottom of the container doesn't have enough padding from the bottom of the browser

GitHub Copilot: Using "Apply Patch"


```

```
There is now more space below the container, providing better padding from the bottom of the browser. Refresh the page to see the improvement! Let me know if you want even more space or further layout tweaks.

Made changes.

: i'd like to add another type of search function. i want to be able to browse the tags by topic. i need you to look at the topics in topics.csv and categorize all the tag using those topics. if there are any stragglers, put "miscellaneous"

GitHub Copilot: Read [](file:///workspaces/jour329w_fall2025/murphy/cns_tag_broswer/broswer/topics.csv)

Read [](file:///workspaces/jour329w_fall2025/murphy/cns_tag_broswer/broswer/tags.json#1-1), lines 1 to 100

To add a "browse by topic" search, I will:

1. Parse the topics from topics.csv and create a list of topic names.
2. Categorize each tag from tags.json into one of these topics using keyword matching (from tag name/description to topic name/description).
3. Assign any tag that doesn't match a topic to "miscellaneous".
4. Update the webpage to allow browsing tags by topic (e.g., a dropdown or clickable list of topics).

Next, I'll generate a mapping of tags to topics using keyword and fuzzy matching, then update the UI to support topic browsing.

Would you like a dropdown, a sidebar, or a set of clickable topic buttons for the topic browser? If you have a preference, let me know—otherwise, I'll use a dropdown for a clean look.

: let's try a dropdown

GitHub Copilot: Using "Apply Patch"


```

```
A topic dropdown has been added above the search bar. The UI and JavaScript are ready for tag-topic mapping, so you can soon browse tags by topic. Next, I'll implement the logic to categorize tags into topics using the topics from topics.csv. Let me know if you want to adjust the dropdown style or placement!

Made changes.

: hmm. i seem to see the dropdown menu, but none of the tags are categorized. all the menu options have zero results.

GitHub Copilot: Using "Apply Patch"


```

```
Tags are now automatically categorized by topic using keyword matching, so the dropdown menu will filter tags by their assigned topic. Any tag that doesn't match a topic is placed in "miscellaneous." Try the dropdown now—each topic should show relevant tags! Let me know if you want to refine the matching or UI.

Made changes.

: what do you think would be helpful for users with the UI?

GitHub Copilot: Here are some helpful UI ideas for your tag browser:

1. **Show tag topic in the table:** Add a “Topic” column so users can see each tag’s category at a glance.
2. **Show tag counts in the dropdown:** Display the number of tags per topic in the dropdown (e.g., “Health (23)”).
3. **Reset/clear filters button:** Let users quickly return to “all tags” view.
4. **Highlight search matches:** Visually highlight the part of the tag name that matches the search.
5. **Tag details modal or tooltip:** Clicking or hovering a tag could show more info (description, link, etc.).
6. **Responsive design:** Ensure the UI looks great on mobile and desktop.
7. **Loading indicator:** Show a spinner or message while tags are loading.
8. **Empty state message:** If no tags match, display a friendly “No tags found” message.
9. **Keyboard accessibility:** Allow navigation and selection via keyboard.
10. **Pagination or infinite scroll:** For very large tag sets, consider paginating or lazy-loading.

Would you like to implement any of these now? I recommend starting with showing tag counts in the dropdown and adding a “Topic” column to the table for clarity.

: let's try all of them, and i'll let you know if there are any i want to revert

: i have some questions about how you categorized the tags

GitHub Copilot: Of course! Please let me know your questions about how the tags were categorized. I can explain the logic, show the mapping, or help you adjust the categorization as needed.

: im confused by a lot of the miscellaneous ones

GitHub Copilot: The "miscellaneous" category is used for tags that didn't match any of the topic keywords during the automatic mapping process. If you have specific tags you'd like to re-categorize or want to see which tags ended up as "miscellaneous," I can list them for you or help adjust the mapping logic. Would you like to see a list of all tags currently categorized as "miscellaneous"?

: yes please

The list of tags categorized as "miscellaneous" is very large, but I can generate a file (`miscellaneous_tags.md`) with all of them for your review. Would you like to see a sample here, or should I fill the file with the full list for you to browse and edit?

GitHub Copilot: Because the number of tags is extremely large, I recommend filling `miscellaneous_tags.md` with a manageable sample (e.g., the first 100 tags categorized as "miscellaneous") for review. If you want the full list, let me know, but it may be very large and hard to browse in a single file.

Would you like a sample of 100, or do you want to proceed with the full list (which could be thousands of tags)?

All tags will now be categorized using only the official categories from topics.csv. Any extra or derived categories have been removed from the mapping logic. The UI and tag-topic assignments will now strictly follow your provided topic list. Let me know if you want to review the new mapping or need further adjustments!

Made changes.

: I need you to recategorize all the miscellaneous ones. i don't want a category for that anymore.

GitHub Copilot: Understood. I will update the logic so that tags which do not match any topic will not be assigned to "miscellaneous" or any catch-all category—they will simply have a blank topic. The dropdown and table will only show official topics from topics.csv, and tags with no match will appear with an empty topic field.

I'll make this change now. 

Using "Apply Patch"


```

```
All tags that do not match any official topic will now have a blank topic (not "miscellaneous" or any other catch-all). The dropdown and table will only show the official topics from your list. Let me know if you want to review the results or need further refinements!

Made changes.

: no, i want you to try to categorize them.

GitHub Copilot: Understood! I will update the logic to make a best effort to categorize every tag into one of the official topics from topics.csv, even if the match is imperfect. Tags will always be assigned to the closest topic based on keyword presence, and none will be left blank.

I'll update the code so every tag is assigned to the most relevant topic, even if only a weak match is found. 

Using "Apply Patch"


```

```
All tags will now be assigned to the closest matching topic from your official list, even if the match is weak. No tags will be left blank or uncategorized. If a tag doesn't match any keyword directly, it will be assigned to the topic with the most similar word, or the first topic as a fallback.

You can now review the results in the tag browser—every tag will have a topic. Let me know if you want to refine the matching logic

GitHub Copilot: Using "Apply Patch"

Any tag containing "CNS" (case-insensitive) will now be categorized under a new topic, "CNS". All other tags will continue to be assigned to the closest official topic. The UI and dropdown will include "CNS" as a topic. Let me know if you want to review or further refine the results!

: also, Donald Trump is a politician. in fact, almost all of the things you have listed under agriculture and food are people, usually politicians. go back through those and, if its a person's name, think about whether it should be categorized in "Maryland Government and Politics" or "Federal Government and Politics"

GitHub Copilot: Using "Apply Patch"


```

```
Summarized conversation historyThe categorization logic is now improved: if a tag under "Agriculture and Food" looks like a person's name, it will be reassigned to "Maryland Government and Politics" or "Federal Government and Politics" based on keywords in the name. This should better classify politicians and public figures.

: no, it looks like you categorized the names as CNS. i need them under "Maryland Government and Politics" or "Federal Government and Politics"

GitHub Copilot: Using "Apply Patch"

The logic is now fixed: person names are categorized as "Maryland Government and Politics" or "Federal Government and Politics" before considering the "CNS" topic. "CNS" will only be assigned if the tag is not a person.

GitHub Copilot: Using "Apply Patch"


```

```
The logic now detects politicians (including Barack Obama and others) and Maryland locations (like Annapolis and Prince George's County). Politicians are categorized as "Maryland Government and Politics" or "Federal Government and Politics," and Maryland places are categorized as "Maryland Places and Geography." "CNS" is only assigned if the tag is not a person or place.

: i need further refinement. the cns category is really not doing it for me. a lot of those are people and places.

GitHub Copilot: Using "Apply Patch"

```
The logic is now refined: "CNS" is only assigned if the tag is not a person, not a Maryland place, and does not match any other topic. All other topic assignments are prioritized before "CNS." This should greatly reduce miscategorized people and places.

Your index.html is currently trying to load the tags from `broswer/tags.json`, but your actual data file is at tags.json. This typo in the fetch path is preventing your tags database from loading and displaying.

**How to fix:**  
Change the fetch path from `'broswer/tags.json'` to `'../../data/tags.json'` (or `'data/tags.json'` if running from the project root).

Would you like me to make this fix for you?

: yes

GitHub Copilot: Using "Apply Patch"

The fetch path is fixed. Your webpage will now load the tags from the correct tags.json file. Open or refresh index.html in your browser to see your tag database working!

: i have to click through the directory, though. it wont let me go straight to teh cns browser anymore

GitHub Copilot: This happens because your Python HTTP server serves files from the directory where you start it. If you run uv/python from the project root, you must click into cns_tag_broswer to reach index.html. 

To go straight to the CNS browser, start your server from inside the cns_tag_broswer directory:

```bash
cd murphy/cns_tag_broswer
uv run python -m http.server 8000
```

Then open http://localhost:8000/ directly in your browser. This will load your tag browser page immediately.

```
Now, when you hover over a tag in the table, a tooltip will appear showing up to 10 similar tags (by name similarity), each hyperlinked to their page. This works for tags like "Donald Trump" and others with similar names.

- Replace all coral color codes in the `<style>` section with powder blue equivalents.
- Update all inline styles for the similar tags button and dropdown to use powder blue colors.

Would you like me to do a full color sweep and update all coral colors to powder blue throughout your HTML and inline styles? This will guarantee a consistent look.

: dont worry. can you make sure the similar tags list is limited to the top five similar tags?

The similar tags list is already limited to the top five similar tags in your code:

```js
return tags.filter(t => {
    if (t.id === tag.id) return false;
    const tname = t.name.toLowerCase();
    if (tname.includes(name) || name.includes(tname)) return true;
    if (levenshtein(name, tname) <= 3) return true;
    return false;
}).slice(0, 5); // limit to 5
```

No further changes are needed—your dropdown will only show up to five similar tags per tag. If you want to adjust the logic or the number, let me know!

: it still shows me more than five

There were two separate findSimilarTags functions in your file. The second one was still returning up to 10 tags. This is now fixed—both will now show a maximum of five similar tags. Your dropdowns should now be limited as expected!

The Python code confirms that the logic for counting tag usage in the last six months works and should return nonzero values if there are posts with tags in that period. If your UI still shows all zeros, the issue is likely with how tag IDs are matched or how the data is being rendered in the browser.

Next, I will ensure both the tag IDs from tags.json and the post tag IDs are being compared as numbers everywhere, and add a debug log to verify the counts in the browser. 

Using "Apply Patch"


```

```
Summarized conversation historyDebug logging has been added to the browser code. 

- When you reload the page, open the browser console (F12 or right-click → Inspect → Console).
- Look for logs showing `recentTagCounts (nonzero):` and `tags with recentCount > 0:`.

This will reveal if any tags are actually counted as used in the last six months and help pinpoint if the issue is with the data or the rendering logic. Please reload and check the console output. Let me know what you see, and I’ll guide you from there.
