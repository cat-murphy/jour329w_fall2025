    "title": "Inside one federal government building: When a passion for peace is torn to pieces",
    "content": "HYATTSVILLE, Md.  — The sight of amputated limbs, deserted buildings and roads piled up with rubble clung to her. \nOn LaToya’s 2006 visit to Monrovia, the Liberian civil wars had left the capital a devastated city.\n“There was just a lot of destruction,” she said. “It looked like a place that used to be developed, but that was no longer existent.”\nLaToya said the trip kindled her love of helping others and her desire to make the world a better place by fighting for peace, inspiring her to pursue a career that supported the missions of international development.\nLaToya, 35, whose name Capital News Service has withheld at her request to protect her privacy, joined the United States Institute of Peace seven years ago as a program specialist and senior administrative assistant.\nWhen she first walked into the building, LaToya said she instantly felt the passion and dedication of those working for peace, which gave her hope that a world without conflict was possible. \n“I felt that’s where I belonged,” she told Capital News Service in an interview.\nThen, on March 28, two weeks after LaToya had been working from home, she received her termination letter and a separation agreement form in her personal email because USIP employees had been locked out of their work emails. It was 10 p.m. She was wrapped in the sheets of her bed, watching a reality TV show. \n“Wow, this is really happening,” she thought as she scrolled. \nLaToya is among more than 400 institute employees caught up in President Donald Trump’s efforts to dismantle the agency. The move was challenged in the courts, triggering over the last couple of months a roller coaster ride of setbacks and wins for the employees. \nLaToya was born to Liberian parents who migrated to the United States in the 80s because of the civil unrest. LaToya spent her 2006 trip visiting orphanages, whose children had lost parents in the wars. She also volunteered in elementary school classrooms packed with older students who had missed out on learning because of the wars.\nA Silver Spring, Maryland, native, LaToya eventually pursued a bachelors degree in sociology and international affairs at American University.\nShe called her work at USIP as being a “global citizen and impacting your neighbor who is next to you, because when one person is doing well, the better we can all do well.”\nLaToya said she felt anger over the way the Trump administration has tried to tear apart the United States Institute of Peace. (Giuseppe LoPiccolo/Capital News Service)\nUSIP works in hostile and conflict-prone territories across the globe to de-escalate and resolve conflict through negotiations. The agency also works to prevent violence before it starts to reduce the need for costly military interventions, according to the institutes former website. The site now says: “Sorry, you have been blocked. You are unable to access usip.org.”\nUSIP has worked with 87 countries, providing foreign governments and local communities with training, resources, education and policy recommendations and applying best practices to address violence.\nThe institute has researched religion’s role in conflict, worked to stop violent extremism, improve laws and justice, prevent election-related violence, and support good governance and communities living under authoritarian rule. \nUSIP was created by Congress in 1984, following proposals from citizens and World War II combat veterans. It received then-President Ronald Reagan’s stamp of approval, and since then has maintained an independent and nonpartisan status. USIP is funded by Congress. \nAt the USIP’s distinctive, dome-roofed Washington headquarters, LaToya’s workspace was lit by a salt lamp and decorated with green plants and a yarn doll in a colorful tribal dress that her colleague had gifted her. \nMost days, and on some weekends, LaToya logged onto her laptop to plan and coordinate conferences that addressed the issues faced by countries in West Africa and the Sahel region, Europe and Central America. Her tasks included organizing speakers, booking flights, creating event schedules, and ensuring that interpreters and the institute’s partner organizations involved in peacebuilding in those countries were paid.\n“I was working behind the scenes to keep everything running smoothly,” she said.\nIn 2022, she traveled to Nigeria to help organize a conference centered on improving community security and rebuilding trust between police officers and civilians.\nThe conference allowed the groups to talk and listen to each other, she said. As a result, police officers distributed plastic whistles to residents without access to phones or emergency services. The whistles would be used to alert neighbors and law enforcement about criminal activity. LaToya said that, for the first time, people were comfortable enough to speak directly to law enforcement officials. \n“It was peace-building in action,” she said. “Oftentimes, that is our role, kind of creating a neutral zone for two parties that may be at odds.”\nBut LaToya knew the Trump administration would come for her job. \nIn January, Trump signed an executive order on “Reevaluating and Realigning United States Foreign Aid,” in which he said foreign aid did not align with American interests and then issued a 90-day pause on the distribution of assistance funds to foreign countries. \nLaToya explained that some of USIP’s projects were funded by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), which delivered food, water and medical aid to people globally and which the executive order targeted. \nUSIP employees whose salaries were tied to USAID-funded projects faced layoffs. While LaToya was having lunch, she saw the workers preparing to leave the building and hugged them goodbye.\nTrump signed another executive order in February on “Commencing the Reduction of the Federal Bureaucracy,” which stated that the USIP, along with three other agencies, was an “unnecessary governmental entity,” and that its functions should “be eliminated to the maximum extent” and staff should be reduced “to the minimum presence and function required by law.”\nLaToya still went about her daily duties in Washington, but she said she was anxious. \nOn March 14, LaToya said she and her colleagues received an email that stated all work would be done from their homes. She said Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) had attempted to enter the USIP building, but the institute’s security guards turned them away. \nDuring the same month, the Trump administration fired the institute’s president, George Moose, along with all of the institute’s board members who were presidentially appointed and confirmed by the Senate, according to a lawsuit filed in March by the institute’s former president and board members. \nDOGE, the Office of Personnel Management and the General Services Administration successfully entered the USIP headquarters with the help of the FBI and a key provided by the institutes former security contractor, and transferred the institute’s privately-owned $500 million building to the GSA, according to a litigation filed by USIP employees and the institute’s partners in April. \nAfter receiving her termination letter and separation agreement on March 28, LaToya said she rang up her colleagues, who had also been fired, and vented to them. They had received their termination and separation agreement letters alphabetically. The Trump administration fired the majority of the institute’s staff, with only about two employees left in finance and human resources in the institute’s headquarters, LaToya said. \nShe had up to 60 days to sign the separation agreement form, and she has not yet done so. \nThe agreement guaranteed her a payment of about $4,000 and the continuation of health benefits coverage for one month if she would “unconditionally release and forever discharge USIP from any and all claims, liabilities, promises, actions, damages … claims of wrongful discharge that USIP or other releasees have treated you unfairly or in bad faith,” according to the agreement form obtained by CNS. “If you do not sign this agreement, you will not receive the additional payments and benefits.” \n“The payments are not an admission of any wrongdoing by USIP,” the form read.\nThe form also asked LaToya not to disclose the terms within the confidential agreement unless “with the advance written consent of USIP,” or as required by law or requested by governmental agencies.\n“It felt like hush money in a way,” LaToya said. “They know the way they’re doing things isn’t the right way to do things. There should be a process to how things are done.”\nLaToya could not sleep until 3 a.m. after getting the termination notice. “It wasn’t very restful,” she said, and even when she woke up, she asked herself, “Is this real life?”\nShe filed for unemployment. She was quiet the following days and began experiencing the stages of grief, she said. “Anger came a little later once I processed everything,” LaToya said.\nShe found solace in nature and walked through the long trails behind her apartment complex, under the warmth of the sun, as she listened to birds chirping away. \nHer husband, with whom she celebrated their one-year wedding anniversary in March, would do the groceries and cook her favorite meals like steak and salmon. \n“It meant a lot,” she said.\nShe went to collect her belongings from the USIP headquarters in early April, and a security guard in a fitted white shirt and navy blue trousers escorted her into the building. She said her goodbyes to colleagues, took pictures with them and parted ways.\nOn Monday, as LaToya awoke for an adventurous day in Barbados for her cousins birthday trip, several messages from her work group chat popped up on her phone.\n“We won!” the messages read.\nU.S. District Judge Beryl Howell ruled on Monday that the Trump administration’s takeover of USIP was an usurpation of power and the removal of the institute’s president and board members, the termination of staff and the transfer of the institute’s building were “null and void.”\nThe Justice Department said it plans to appeal the ruling. But the USIP leaders retook possession of their offices on Wednesday.\n“We don’t know what happens next,” LaToya said, “but I feel cautiously optimistic.”"

    "title": "‘There’s nothing left of the Republican Party’: Maryland veterans join pro-Ukraine GOP group",
    "content": "WASHINGTON – In the depths of the ocean, a young submarine officer spent his part of the Cold War on the USS Bluefish (SSN-675), a Sturgeon-class fast-attack submarine built to track and sink Soviet ballistic missile subs. \nThat officer was John Ronning, now 71, of Baltimore. A self-described lifelong Republican, he’s one of five Marylanders featured in Republicans for Ukraine, a national coalition launched by Defending Democracy Together, a nonprofit advocacy group founded by prominent conservatives, including William Kristol and Mona Charen.\n“I felt like I played a small part in bringing down the Berlin Wall and setting the captive nations free, including Ukraine,” Ronning said. “So it’s kind of extremely upsetting to see my party standing in the way and saying, ‘We don’t care what Russia does to Ukraine,’ after we helped to get them their freedom.”\nLaunched in 2023, Republicans for Ukraine is part of an umbrella group that also leads projects such as Republicans for Voting Rights and Republicans for the Rule of Law. It spotlights GOP voters who still support U.S. aid to Ukraine and back the country’s fight against Russia — a stance increasingly rare within the party.\nThe project’s website features video testimonials from Republicans and conservatives across the country, along with report cards that grade House GOP members from A to F, based on their support for Ukraine. \nThe website’s front page statement reads: “The GOP was once a proud defender of freedom and democracy. We are amplifying the voices of Republicans who still believe that the United States should be a steadfast friend to democracies like Ukraine — and a fearsome opponent of aggressive dictatorships like Russia.”\nJim Naylor, a Marine Corps veteran and former aviation radio technician from Baltimore, is featured in a video titled “Jim is a Republican for Ukraine.” He sits in front of a camera and, in just under three minutes, speaks with quiet conviction about his unwavering support for the embattled nation. \n\nNaylor grew up as a Republican, with a family deeply committed to the party; there was no doubt that he would follow suit. He was attracted to the party’s support for free trade, the rule of law and fiscal conservatism. \n“It was 2016 when I started being disaffected with the Republican Party,” Naylor said. In his view, the values he had once stood for had vanished. “There’s nothing left of the Republican Party.” \nHis political break became public in 2019. \nThat year, Republicans Voters Against Trump put out a call for former Donald Trump voters who no longer stood behind the president. Naylor said he heard the call on a podcast and felt he fit the bill. He submitted a testimonial — although he describes it more as a confessional — in which he felt he had to atone behind a camera for his past vote.\n\nMore recently, the Republican Party’s approach to the war in Ukraine and rhetoric from leaders like Trump has widened the ideological split, according to GOP backers of Ukraine.\nIn February, during a televised Oval Office meeting, Trump told Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky: “You’re playing cards. You’re playing cards. You’re gambling with the lives of millions of people. You’re gambling with World War III. You’re gambling with World War III. And what you’re doing is very disrespectful to the country, this country, that’s backed you far more than a lot of people said they should have.” Vice President J.D. Vance, seated nearby, asked Zelensky if he said “thank you” to Trump even once during the meeting.\nThe ambush stunned much of the political world and foreign policy experts said the incident reflected Trump’s continuing refusal to hold Putin to account for his invasion of Ukraine.\nNaylor said political discussions with his family, some of whom lean more toward the “Make America Great Again” movement, are now off-limits. “Everything becomes a culture war,” he said, adding that even casual mentions of pop star Taylor Swift can spark tension with extended family, since his kids are fans and Swift publicly supported former Vice President Kamala Harris on Instagram.\nRonning recalled that in the 1980s, the term “neo-conservative,” or “neo-con,” referred to Democrats who thought their party was too soft on communism and shifted right to support then-President Ronald Reagan’s efforts to win the Cold War. \nToday, he said, the term has taken on a new, distorted meaning, often used by Trump-aligned conservatives to mock or condemn anyone who supports U.S. involvement overseas. \n“It’s used almost like a swear word. It’s like, ‘You’re a Nazi,’ Ronning said.\nA self-described “Reagan Republican,” Ronning’s admiration for that president stretches back to 1968, when he first saw him during his first, brief presidential campaign. Ronning was 14 years old then. \n“To me, it was a no-brainer,” Ronning said. “Communists had no conscience about killing people by the millions,” and since then, he’s been anti-Russia. \nThat early worldview shaped his decision to enter military service.\nWhile Ronning was aboard the Bluefish at Norfolk Naval Shipyard, Reagan delivered a stirring speech directed at people living under communism. The president said: “And to every person trapped in tyranny, whether in the Ukraine, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Cuba, or Vietnam, we send our love and support and tell them they are not alone.” \nThe difference between Reagan’s GOP and Trump’s, Ronning said, is stark. \nFor Naylor, the case for helping Ukraine feels like common sense. \n“I feel like history is in front of us — a moral crossroads,” Naylor said.  “We can be on the side of the underdog or not.”\nNaylor said only a fraction of the U.S. defense budget — “pennies on the dollar,” in his words — is needed to help Ukraine fight what he calls “a real enemy, not an invisible one.” \n“They’re not asking for our sons and daughters to go over there and bleed for them,” Naylor said. “They’re just asking for the fight, for like 1% of our annual defense budget.” \nDisillusioned with the GOP’s new direction, Naylor now identifies more as a moderate Democrat, although he says he still holds Republican principles. \nRonning, meanwhile, considers himself a constitutional conservative — and is sticking with the party he fell in love with at 14 under Reagan. \nSupporters from 46 states and D.C. have added their voices to the Republicans for Ukraine website, united by one message: Ukraine needs support.\n“​​Vladimir Putin is an enemy of the United States, and should be treated as such. Supporting Ukraine is in the best interests of our country and the best traditions of the Republican Party,” the website states. “Just because Trump has switched sides, doesn’t mean the rest of us have to.”"

    "title": "Port of Baltimore unlikely to see tariff impacts until next month",
    "content": "BALTIMORE  It is still too early to gauge the impacts of President Donald Trump’s widespread tariffs on imported goods on the Port of Baltimore, despite other ports experiencing changes.\n“We expect to see impacts with our container business, especially from China,” Richard Scher, director of communications for the Port Baltimore, said in a statement to Capital News Service. “But those impacts will likely not show until June.”\nTinglong Dai, operations management and business analytics professor at the Johns Hopkins Carey Business School, told CNS that larger ports, like the Port of Los Angeles and the neighboring Port of Long Beach, would experience a much more significant drop in imports compared to the Port of Baltimore because the general volume of imports at the southern California ports is much greater.\nLos Angeles and Long Beach also are geographically closer to China, the second-largest source of U.S. imports, and other Asian and South Pacific nations.\nOn May 12, the United States and China reached an agreement to lower tariffs. Under the new deal, the United States will reduce tariffs on goods imported from China from 145 percent to 30 percent, while China will lower its tariffs on American imports from 125 percent to 10 percent.\n“It is important to note that even with this China agreement, tariffs are much higher overall than they were at the beginning of the year,” John Murphy, senior vice president at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said in a statement issued after the U.S.-China trade talks. Businesses, including small enterprises, are trying to manage with the disruptions and growing costs, Murphy added.\n“We continue to urge the Trump Administration to prioritize tariff relief for businesses and families, and to address foreign trade barriers as it negotiates with other countries,” Murphy said.\n“Ultimately, the impact of tariffs on the Port of Baltimore and all ports will depend on the length of time that the tariffs are implemented in addition to the decisions of shippers to send their products to the U.S.,” Scher said.\nLast year, the Port of Baltimore was the second-biggest importer of automobiles in the United States. It lost its first place due to the Francis Scott Key Bridge collapse, which paused operations at the port from March to July last year.\nBaltimore’s port is one of the only ports in the country to have equipment and facilities to handle and store Roll-On/Roll-Off cargo like fully assembled cars, motorcycles and trucks.\nThe Port of Baltimore also receives other imports like nuclear reactors, boilers, machinery, aluminum, iron and steel, according to U.S. Census data.\nSome auto manufacturing customers that ship into U.S. ports, including Baltimore, are holding their vehicles at the port of entry, while others are adding import fees or absorbing the tariffs, Scher said.\nRep. Johnny Olszewski, D-Maryland, told CNS the tariffs are another setback for the Port of Baltimore, which still is recovering from the bridge collapse.\n“Its challenge after challenge after challenge, except this one is completely avoidable. Theres no reason for the president to need to propose these tariffs,” Olszewki said. “Theres been no good reason expressed to members of Congress or the American people about what the real purpose of a tariff is.”\nThe congressman said he has not received any complaints or concerns related to the tariffs from individual port workers.\nThe International Longshoremen’s Association, which represents Baltimore’s port workers, endorsed Trump in last year’s election. ILA President Harold Daggett in January credited Trump with helping the union obtain a new contract with stronger provisions against automation. He called the president “one of the best friends of working men and women in the United States.”\nThe ILA said it had no comment on the tariffs for now.\nDai said the tariffs would impact port workers and truck drivers in the long run.\nThe Port of Baltimore is an economic engine that would have a direct and indirect impact on all the sectors and workers supporting it, Dai said.\n“It’s an entire ecosystem,” he said."

    "title": "DC area food industry shaken after DHS visits more than 100 businesses",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  Department of Homeland Security agents visited more than 100 businesses in the Washington area last week, including nearly a dozen popular restaurants, leaving owners and staff on edge.\n“For the community as a whole, throughout the entire D.C. and DMV region, its an unnerving time…for the industry as a collective,” said Natasha Neely, vice president of Pupatella, one of the restaurants targeted by DHS.\nThe DHS confirmed the agents’ visits in a statement: U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Investigations is conducting worksite enforcement actions across the nation to ensure businesses are following U.S. immigration and employment laws.\nThis includes recent worksite enforcement operations (in) the D.C. area, during which more than 100 Notice of Inspections were served to local employers at various business(es). No arrests were made as part of these worksite enforcement operations.\nNeely told Capital News Service that DHS agents unexpectedly visited both Pupatella locations on Tuesday, May 6, inquiring about I-9 forms, which are documents used to verify employees’ eligibility to work in the United States.\nAt the restaurant’s Dupont location, agents met the general manager outside, identified themselves and asked about the I-9s. When the agents failed to present a warrant, the manager followed company protocol and referred them to the corporate office.\nA few hours later, agents arrived at Pupatella’s Capitol Hill location, where the manager had already been alerted by Neely. Though they still did not have a signed warrant, the agents presented a four-page Notice of Inspection stating they were conducting a standard I-9 audit. The notice stated that agents would return the following week and included a list of suggestions for compliance, Neely said.\nThe notice, which used nearly identical language across businesses, also required owners to hand over the employee records to DHS within three days, according to Abel Nuñez, the executive director of the Central American Resource Center, a nonprofit that provides legal aid to the Latino community in the Washington area.\n“(DHS) seems to be going to what I would call D.C. staples that everyone knows,” Neely said. “Things that D.C. is known for—that the community gets behind, that started out in this region—and then it expanded beyond that.”\nIn addition to Pupatella, DHS visited Millie’s, Chef Geoff’s, Chang Chang, Ghostburger, Officina, Jaleo, Call Your Mother, Clyde’s, Cynthia, Santa Rosa Taqueria and others, according to reports by The Washingtonian and Eater DC.\nAs of Wednesday, no arrests had been confirmed, and no agents had returned to Pupatella.\nStill, workers at bars and restaurants across the city remain on high alert. Representatives from four restaurants said Wednesday that they had lost employees, either permanently or temporarily, since the DHS visits, according to a report by The Washington Post.\nThe two-day sweep began a few days after warnings started circulating online about possible immigration enforcement action targeting restaurants and food delivery drivers in Washington.\n“It was very much a blindside—aside from the rumor mill…there was nothing directly to us as a company,” Neely said. “Nothing that had been confirmed or was substantial. Nothing. We did not receive any form of notification.”\nNuñez told CNS that the short timeline puts restaurant workers without legal status at risk, even when they’re not on the job.\n“The addresses (on I-9s) are probably pretty current, so that’s a way of identifying where they live, and then just going to pick them up. I doubt that people can move in three days,” he said.\nWorkers who may have provided false information on their I-9s face heightened legal risks, Nuñez added. In such cases, DHS could consider that probable cause for arrest and pursue additional charges like identity theft or falsifying federal documents — and the employers who knowingly hired them could also face steep fines.\nWashington Mayor Muriel Bowser condemned the visits and said that the Metropolitan Police Department was not involved.\n“I have heard those reports. I’ve been getting them all morning. I am disturbed by them,” she told reporters on May 6. “It appears as though ICE is at restaurants or even in neighborhoods — and it doesn’t look like they’re targeting criminals, and it does look like they’re disrupting.”\nDHS’s actions in Washington are part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to annually deport 1 million immigrants.\nAlthough I-9 audits have occurred under previous administrations, Nuñez said that the unannounced DHS visits indicated a “clear attempt to intimidate owners” and marked a departure from standard practice.\n“This is not a new thing. I-9 audits are embedded in the law. Biden did it. Obama did it,” Nuñez said. “But usually it’s a letter sent to you via mail telling (your business) that ICE will conduct a raid within a couple of weeks, so they give you time to prepare. They usually do not get delivered by hand.”\nNeely said Pupatella is working to support staff across its locations and ensure they understand their rights in the event of future audits or raids.\nImmigration advocates stressed that all workers, regardless of legal status, have the right to remain silent, speak to an attorney if detained and refuse to sign any documents.\n“D.C. residents and D.C. workers have rights in this country, regardless of their immigration status,” UNITE HERE Local 25, a union representing hospitality workers in the Washington area, said in a statement to CNS. “The vilification and dehumanization of immigrants and erosion of rights, including due process…, is a direct threat to the rights of all working people.”\nNuñez warned that mass deportations among restaurant workers could have lasting, devastating effects on the greater Washington area.\n“This will have ripple effects at an individual level, at a family level, but also at a city level,” he said. “Were all integrated—when one of us doesnt have the ability to work well, it impacts everybody else.”"

    "title": "Visitors, workers &#8211; and Democrats &#8211; dismayed at sudden firing of Librarian of Congress Carla Hayden",
    "content": "WASHINGTON – In the Library of Congress, visitors from across the country, some stepping inside the ornate, Beaux-Arts building for the first time, reacted with anger and dismay to President Donald Trump’s abrupt firing of Librarian of Congress Carla Hayden, the first African American and woman to head the institution.\n“It just really, really sets us back as a nation and as a country, and for women, it just sends a message that we’re not good enough to hold positions of power and influence,” Californian Rita Bradfield said as she walked with her husband, Bruce, their daughter, Asante, and Rita’s sister, Carol, through the library’s Great Hall. “I think for like my daughter and the younger folks…young ladies, you know, it’s just…really sad because you guys are the future.”\nCongressional Democrats also were outraged by Hayden’s sudden dismissal. Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Maryland said in an X post that her firing was a “scandal.”\nRep. Johnny Olszewski, D-Maryland, said in a statement that “President Trump’s reportedly callous dismissal of Carla Hayden is a disgraceful disservice to all Americans. We must call this out for what it is: an attack on our democratic norms and yet another effort to replace dedicated public servants with MAGA allies. Dr. Hayden – who ran Baltimore’s famous Enoch Pratt Free Library for 23 years prior to serving as Librarian of Congress – has dedicated her career to her community and her country.” \nAccording to a screenshot by Sen. Martin Heinrich, D-New Mexico, an email to Hayden read: “On behalf of President Donald J. Trump, I am writing to inform you that your position as the Librarian of Congress is terminated effective immediately. Thank you for your service.” It was sent by Trent Morse, the deputy director of presidential personnel. \nAppointed by then-President Barack Obama in 2016, Hayden was behind initiatives to modernize how the national library handles its vast collections and to connect the country with the library itself. The Library of Congress is a repository of books, papers, documents, and visual and audio recordings, including some of the nation’s most important artifacts, such as the papers of Frederick Douglass and the items found in President Abraham Lincoln’s pockets on the night of his assassination. \n“Yesterday, the White House informed Librarian of Congress Carla Hayden that she has been relieved of her position,” a spokesperson of the Library of Congress said. “Principal Deputy Librarian Robert Newlen will assume the duties of acting Librarian of Congress until further instruction.”\nA staff member at the Library of Congress said that workers cannot talk to the press on the record about the situation. However, many workers on Friday privately expressed heartbreak over her dismissal.\nWASHINGTON  A wall in the Library of Congress lists all of the past and current Librarians of Congress on May 9, 2025. (Jess Daninhirsch/Capital News Service)\nOne employee recalled Hayden bringing in coffee and crumpets, fully involving herself with both staff and visitors. She never carried herself as “high and mighty,” the employee said.  \nAnother employee described Hayden as a “sweet woman” who was loved by people of all backgrounds. One worker hadn’t even heard about her dismissal until informed by Capital News Service reporters and appeared distressed at the news. \nBruce, Rita’s husband who is white, said the firing spoke to a deeper misuse of authority. \n“I think that the firing of this beautiful woman, librarian, is just a white male in a position of power, abusing his power to basically build a nation that he sees and wants as just divided and he wants to conquer all,” he said. “He’s wrong, in every way, shape or form.”\nJennifer N., a Texan and first-time visitor to the library with her daughter and sister-in-law, said she learned about Hayden’s firing from a protester outside while she was waiting in line.\n“It makes me sick, I hate it. It’s despicable,” Jennifer said. “It feels like, why would he (Trump) do this? It makes no sense, and it doesn’t seem threatening…I am so mad about everything, and it just seems like this is just one more thing along the line of sh—y things he’s done.”\nIn recent weeks, Trump has been sifting through various governmental agencies, purging top officials who fail to align with the administration’s viewpoints. Additionally, the American Accountability Foundation – a far-right conservative opposition research organization – had posted multiple on X, formerly Twitter, beginning on May 1, calling for Hayden’s removal.\nOne post from the organization on May 1 said: “Obama-era left-wing activists are still running the Library of Congress and it’s TIME for them to GO!”\n\nAll fellow Marylanders can take pride in the work of Dr. Carla Hayden, who has provided remarkable leadership as the Librarian of Congress. Her sacking by Donald Trump, who knows little about Congress and less about libraries, is a scandal exposing his contempt for learning,…\n— Rep. Jamie Raskin (@RepRaskin) May 9, 2025\n\nHayden was the first professional librarian to hold the position of librarian of Congress since 1974.\nOutside of the library, Joanie A. from Massachusetts, who said she hadn’t visited Washington since fourth grade, spoke passionately in the rain alongside her husband after finding out about Hayden’s firing inside from a worker.\n“I was very moved with all this — the quotes on the walls, the murals,” Joanie said, reflecting on her morning visit to the library. “Never in my life, at 70, did I expect our world to be so opposed and hateful of one another.”\nWhile the Library of Congress is under the control of the legislative branch, the librarian is nominated by the president and confirmed by the U.S. Senate. Hayden was confirmed in July 2016 on a bipartisan vote of 74-18.\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York called Hayden “a trailblazer, a scholar, and a public servant of the highest order.”\n“Donald Trump’s decision to fire Dr. Carla Hayden is the latest foray in his relentless campaign to dismantle the guardrails of our democracy and punish public servants who dont bend to his every will,” Schumer said in a statement. “Enough is enough. Just as we’ve moved to bring accountability to the Architect of the Capitol, we must assert our congressional prerogative by making the position of Librarian of Congress appointed by a Congressional commission — not by presidents that treat federal appointments like reality TV prizes.” \nSenate Majority Leader John Thune, R-South Dakota, voted to confirm Hayden in 2016. His office had not released a statement as of mid-afternoon Friday. His office did not respond to a request for comment."

    "title": "Maryland lawmakers decry possible Medicaid cuts amid 24-hour protest near US Capitol",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  Nicole Jorwic hadn’t slept in 30 hours by the time the 24-hour vigil protesting proposed Medicaid cuts ended Thursday afternoon on the National Mall.\nThe Chicago-based organizer and chief program officer for the advocacy group Caring Across Generations helped lead the event, which her organization hosted.\n“We wanted (the Congress) members who are contemplating these massive cuts … to Medicaid to have to hear and see and face the family caregivers, the disabled people of all ages, the aging adults and the care workers who will be directly impacted,” Jorwic told Capital News Service.\nJorwic was joined by 15 Democratic lawmakers, including Sen. Chris Van Hollen and Rep. Jamie Raskin, both of Maryland, disability advocates, health care workers, Medicaid users, a live band and, at the vigil’s peak, at least 300 protesters.\nWASHINGTON  Maryland Sen. Chris Van Hollen, a Democrat, speaks at a vigil Thursday supporting the Medicaid program. (Mennatalla Ibrahim/Capital News Service)\n“Keep your hands off our Medicaid,” Van Hollen said. “We cannot stop for one second…we are gathered to make sure that our voices will be heard, and we will keep doing this between now and the time that we save Medicaid.”\nMedicaid is a joint federal and state program that helps cover medical costs for low-income and disabled individuals. About 71 million Americans, including 1.2 million Marylanders, were enrolled in Medicaid as of September 2024, according to Medicaid’s site.\nThe vigil, which began on Wednesday afternoon, took place ahead of a House Energy and Commerce Committee meeting to mark up a controversial proposal that would cut federal Medicaid spending by $880 billion over the next decade—a plan that has faced bipartisan backlash.\nThe markup was originally scheduled for Thursday but has since been pushed to next week. While it’s unclear whether the delay is related to the vigil, protesters and organizers said they feel optimistic.\n“The shift in timeline and the differences of opinion on the Hill are absolutely due to all the advocacy that this community here has done over the last weeks and months,” protester and Washington resident Sarah Coombs, 39, said. “I remain hopeful, and I’m hoping that next week’s markup will be further delayed.”\nOver the 24 hours, dozens of speakers shared personal stories about Medicaid, including Van Hollen. The senator told the story of Mary H., a constituent from Carroll County, whose 52-year-old son has been battling colon cancer for the past six years. Her son, who undergoes chemotherapy every two weeks, lost his business and now relies on Medicaid. In a letter to Van Hollen, Mary H. wrote that cutting Medicaid would mean a “death sentence” for her son.\n“You can not make these big cuts to Medicaid without hurting real people,” Van Hollen said.\nJorwic said that her brother’s reliance on the health insurance program is a major driving force in her fight against its dismantlement.\n“From a professional level, Medicaid is a health care program. It provides health care to millions of people,” Jorwic said. “On a personal note…Medicaid means freedom and independence for people like my brother Chris, who has autism, and thats why Im here. Thats why I would stay up another 24 hours.”\nSinsi Hernandez-Cancio is a senior fellow for health equity at the National Partnership for Women and Families in Washington. She told CNS that she fears the country would have a lot more sick people, struggling families, death and disabilities without Medicaid.\n“Health care is the biggest sector of the national economy and an enormous sector here in the DMV,” she said. “It’s really important that these programs continue so that people can not only get the care they need but that health care workers are able to have the jobs that they need.”\nAt a Thursday press conference after the vigil, Maryland lawmakers warned that the Trump administration’s proposed sweeping cuts to their state’s health programs, paired with Medicaid cuts, could have devastating effects on their constituents.\n“A bunch of us are going to rallies and protests. A rally a day keeps the fascists away,” Raskin, who spoke in the first few hours of the vigil Wednesday, said at Thursday’s press conference.\nVan Hollen and Jorwic said this was not the first time Medicaid has been under threat. The first Trump administration tried to abolish the Affordable Care Act in 2017.\n“We’re doing the same thing here today…Hell no! We’re not going to let you take away our Medicaid,” Van Hollen said.\nJorwic shared said that her organization plans to continue its advocacy into next week as the new markup date approaches.\n“Were going to have a video truck going around (Capitol Hill) playing a loop of the last 24 hours,” she said. “So our voices and the voices of everyone who is here…are going to be holding (lawmakers) accountable if they vote for these cuts.”"

    "title": "Trump is following the &#8216;universal autocrats playbook,&#8217; US diplomats warn",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  Former U.S. ambassadors warned Tuesday that democracy is at serious risk under the Trump presidency, drawing parallels between the administration and past autocracies and urging Americans to stay vigilant.\n“We’ve served our nation. We’ve served presidents, Democratic and Republican…we love our democracy and we want to see it continue,” Harry Thomas, former ambassador to Zimbabwe (2016-2018), said at a panel in downtown Washington. “I think criticizing a president is part of democracy—nonviolent criticism is part of democracy.”\nThe event, hosted by local bookstore and community space Busboys and Poets, featured a nearly 90-minute discussion between journalist Jon Lee Anderson and four former U.S. diplomats: Thomas, former deputy chief of mission in Moscow Eric Rubin (2008-2011), former ambassador to Panama John Feeley (2015-2018) and former ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch (2016-2019).\nThe discussion came a week after the four joined almost 200 other former American diplomats and national security leaders in signing an open letter entitled The Assault on American Democracy: A Call to Action.” The letter warned that U.S. democracy and global leadership are under threat, and said defending them from authoritarianism will require unified, urgent resistance.\n“The challenge comes from within, as President Trump and his administration have assaulted the pillars of our democracy here at home and our strength around the world,” the letter said. “American democracy and American security are inextricably linked; weaken one and the other inevitably begins to fail…We see that link unraveling at lightning speed.”\nAnderson opened the discussion by outlining what he called the “universal autocrat playbook,” a set of tactics historically used by tyrants around the world to turn democracies into dictatorships.\nAmong them: eliminating checks and balances, silencing opposition, instilling fear and confusion, attacking the press and spreading disinformation, leveraging nepotism and cronyism, targeting vulnerable groups, promoting exclusionary patriotism, disregarding due process and rewriting the constitution to expand executive power.\n“Does any of that sound familiar?” Anderson said, referencing the president’s sweeping actions in his first 100 days and laughing alongside the other panelists.\nUsing the playbook as a framework, the ambassadors drew comparisons between the Trump administration’s early moves and patterns they witnessed while serving in countries where democratic norms were gradually dismantled.\n“Autocracy is a lot like a virus,” Feeley said, quoting Nicaraguan political activist Félix Maradiaga. “If your body’s autoimmune system doesn’t pick up the virus by the time you show symptoms, it’s probably too late. That’s why we’re here today…This kind of event — nonviolent, respectful, apolitical — is about the autoimmune system of a democracy.”\nAs Zimbabwe’s democracy crumbled under former President Robert Mugabe, Thomas saw the collapse of the economy along with sharp declines in agriculture and tourism.\nIn Russia, Rubin watched President Vladimir Putin’s government weaponize the military against its own people.\nIn Nicaragua, Feeley witnessed as President Daniel Ortega stacked leadership positions with loyal friends and family.\nAnd in Ukraine, before Volodymyr Zelenskyy became president, Yovanovitch saw Russian fear-mongering and threats against educational institutions as the country faced renewed invasion.\nRubin urged the audience to put aside what he called a uniquely American optimism when evaluating the Trump administrations efforts to curtail civil liberties.\n“If we wake up one morning and you hear about something really terrible, please don’t say there must be an innocent explanation. Please don’t say that in our country, things like this are not intentional,” he said.\nThroughout the panel, the diplomats stressed the importance of standing up for democratic values through both individual and collective action, even in the face of repression and fear.\n“The playbook, as we’ve seen, is to go after the most vulnerable. We need to have community as our shield,” Yovanovitch said. “Change is slow, and then it happens really quickly.”"

    "title": "Returning from El Salvador, Van Hollen says &#8216;we need to bring Mr. Abrego García home&#8217;",
    "content": "DULLES, Va. —  Handcuffed, shackled and unable to see out the plane windows or know where they were headed, Kilmar Abrego García and others were flown to El Salvador. Authorities placed him in a cell with around 25 others at CECOT, the country’s most notorious prison.\nMaryland Sen. Chris Van Hollen shared those details and others after returning from El Salvador Friday, hours after President Donald Trump publicly called him a “a fake” for visiting. The senator spoke alongside the members of the Maryland Legislative Latino Caucus and Abrego García’s family — including his wife, brother and mother — at Washington Dulles International Airport shortly after his flight landed.\nAs the federal courts have said, we need to bring Mr. Abrego Garcia home to protect his constitutional rights to due process, Van Hollen said. “This is a case about upholding the constitutional rights for Mr. Abrego García and every American.\nAfter arriving in El Salvador on Wednesday, Van Hollen said he initially was denied his requests of the Salvadoran government to meet Abrego García to confirm his well-being. It wasn’t until Van Hollen was about to fly back to the United States that he received word that he was allowed to meet with Abrego García in the hotel where the senator was staying in San Salvador.\n“Well, I think the reason they relented, its pretty clear they were feeling the pressure,” Van Hollen said. “I think that they decided that it was not a good look to continue to detain Abrego García without anybody having access to him. There’s no other explanation for the fact that they said no.”\nPart of that pressure, Van Hollen said, may have been prompted by his mention of a possible violation of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights during one of two press conferences he held in El Salvador with local media. The covenant, created by the United Nations in 1966, requires governments to allow detainees access to a lawyer or legal counsel.\n“It could have been a factor, because they are in blatant violation of that requirement, that international law requirement, not only in this case, but actually in all of these cases,” he said as the caucus behind him clapped in agreement.\nDuring the meeting, which made Abrego García one of very few prisoners to make it out of CECOT, he told the senator he was “traumatized” after spending weeks in the mega-prison, but since has been transferred to a prison in Santa Ana, which Van Hollen said is “pretty far outside” San Salvador.  \n“He was not afraid of the other prisoners in his immediate cells, but that he was traumatized by being at CECOT,” Van Hollen said. “(He was) fearful of many of the prisoners in other cell blocks who called out to him and taunted him in various ways.” \nOver coffee, water and margaritas, which Van Hollen said neither he nor Abrego García drank, the two discussed Abrego García’s time in the country. El Salvador President Nayib Bukele previously mocked them on X for being in “tropical paradise.” Van Hollen said the Salvadoran government staged the “margarita-gate,” noting that two government officials came over and placed two glasses with salt or sugar on the rim in front of them.\nMaryland Sen.

(Jess Daninhirsch/Capital News Service)\n“And if you look at the one they put in front of Kilmar, it actually had a little less liquid than the one in front of me, to try to make it look, I assume, like he drank out of it,” Van Hollen said. “If you sip out of one of those glasses, some of whatever it was, salt or sugar would disappear. You would see a gap. Theres no gap. Nobody drank any margaritas or sugar water or whatever it was.”\nAlthough Van Hollen got the answers he was searching for about Abrego García’s health and well-being, the Trump administration has given no indication it will bring him back home. \nVan Hollen said he understands the administration has an agreement to pay El Salvador $15 million to detain prisoners.\n“I dont know whether there is an agreement that specifically spells out the terms and conditions here. I am aware that there was some document that memorialized the payments,” Van Hollen said, calling the payments unauthorized because they didn’t go through the congressional appropriations process.\nMaryland Sen. Chris Van Hollen meets with Kilmar Abrego García in El Salvador on April 17, 2025, via Nayib Bukeles X account. (Screenshot by Jess Daninhirsch/Capital News Service)\nAt the White House hours earlier, Trump insisted that Abrego García was a criminal. Reading from a piece of paper, the president said: Hes an illegal alien, MS-13 gang member, and foreign terrorist.\nThe administration is under pressure from the courts to return Abrego García.\nU.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit on Thursday rejected the Trump administrations effort to stop a lower courts order that government officials must be questioned about the deportation of Abrego García. The three-judge panel wrote that the governments position should be shocking not only to judges, but to the intuitive sense of liberty that Americans far removed from courthouses still hold dear.\nIn a call-out to El Salvador, Van Hollen ridiculed the government and President Nayib Bukele for branding the country as a place for mega-prisons where people are being “illegally abducted.” He noted that the country had once focused its branding on technology and Bitcoin but was now gaining a new reputation.\nJust as the press conference began, it ended with chants from the caucus: “Sí se puede, sí se puede,” as supporters held bright orange signs reading, “Thank you Senator Van Hollen."

    "title": "U.S. dominance in science at risk with Trump cuts, scientists warn",
    "content": "WASHINGTON – Weston Slaughter, a Ph.D. student in the University of Maryland’s Department of Geology, always wanted to be a government scientist. But if the Trump administration were to cut federal funding for science programs, his aspirations may become bleaker and blurrier.\n“I think my dream is still to be able to do science that is meaningful and useful for the public and for the public good,” Slaughter said. “But, I don’t know, I’m certainly not counting any chickens.”\nThe United States has been the world leader in science for decades, but the Trump administration has made plans to cancel or freeze federal grants that fund scientific institutions and universities and shrink or abolish federal scientific agencies. Such actions would end the country’s decades of preeminence in science, researchers and experts warn.\nAround 1,900 members of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine signed a letter warning President Donald Trump of the dangers that funding cuts present.\n“We all rely on science. Science gave us the smartphones in our pockets, the navigation systems in our cars, and life-saving medical care,” the letter said.\n“A climate of fear has descended on the research community,” the scientists said, referring to what the future would look like after funding cuts.\n“What is happening in this administration is that they are engaged in a process of closing down scientific exchange, debate and multiple opinions, which represent important ways to advance knowledge and find solutions to national and global problems to make life better for our nation,” Dr. Ruth Enid Zambrana,  a distinguished university professor in the Harriet Tubman Department of Women, Gender and Sexuality Studies at the University of Maryland in College Park, told Capital News Service. She was one of the academies’ letter’s signers.\nDr. Christopher Jarzynski, a distinguished professor of chemistry and biochemistry at the University of Maryland in College Park, echoed Zambrana’s sentiments but said that researchers and scientists must continue to do their work regardless of what may happen.\n“We need to continue doing what we’re doing and believing that it’s valuable,” Jarzynski said. He also signed the academies’ letter.\nHowever, Jarzynski said there has been hesitation in his department about bringing on new graduate students because he does not know whether or not they will be able to fund new students. This has led to difficulties for many undergraduate students applying to graduate schools and worries for current graduate students, like Slaughter, about finishing their programs.\n“Do I think that I can reasonably expect to be able to be funded to complete my graduate research? I dont know,” Slaughter said. “It’s likely that many people may struggle to get jobs, many people may not be able to complete their graduate school, but there’s also going to be a large class of people that are going to be asked to do a lot more with a lot less.”\nSlaughter also mentioned the difficulties international students and faculty members face when they come to the United States to study or work in academia.\n“I can’t emphasize enough that, across the board, in this country, our research and development depends on people from foreign countries that want to come here and are willing to come here to do research,” Slaughter said. “Not only attacking the public funding of science, but just this multilateral assault, not only on that, but also on immigrants…in many different ways, I feel like, is working to deteriorate the things that make good science possible in the U.S.”\nFunding cuts could extend beyond the laboratories, though, and impact many aspects of American life, scientists said.\n“Science is a knowledge production process to help the human condition survive and thrive in its environment,” Zambrana said. “Therefore, we are ethically bound, in my view, to look at the reduction of scientific funding to universities as a more significant problem than the disruption of our work as scientists.”\n“It profoundly impacts the institutions and the staff personnel who support these efforts, the education of the next generation of scientists, and the well-being of the people in the nation who ultimately benefit from scientific discovery,” she said.\nResearchers from the University of Maryland and the University of Pennsylvania collaborated to create a map that showed the impact that the National Institutes of Health (NIH) funding cuts could have across the country. The map showed an estimated $16 billion in economic losses and the disappearance of 68,000 jobs.\nDr. Kirsten Lyke, a professor of medicine at the University of Maryland’s School of Medicine in Baltimore and a signer of the letter, said that 99.4% of drugs that are in use have had funding from the National Institutes of Health at some point in their development. The federal freeze on NIH funding could decrease funding for medicines, she said.\nDr. Lawrence Appel, a professor of medicine at Johns Hopkins University’s Bloomberg School of Public Health, said that researchers and scientists are experiencing “decision paralysis” in their jobs. Many may have had relatively stable jobs, but they are suddenly unsure of what will happen and where to go next in their careers. Appel was also one of the professors who signed the letter.\n“Nobody has a handle on whether these huge structural changes will persist,” Appel said. “If the changes do persist, the effects will be felt on the research enterprise, with ripple effects on the economy.”\nThe National Academy of Sciences was formed in 1863 during President Abraham Lincoln’s administration; the National Academy of Engineering was established in 1964 and the National Academy of Medicine in 1970. The academies’ purposes were to advise the national government on scientific matters.\nThe academies were intended to be apolitical, but Lyke said that these are extraordinary times and that the academies must do a better job of explaining the benefits of science in terms that the general public can understand.\nMultiple researchers who signed the National Academies’ letter shared similar ideas of what the next steps could look like, either before or after the hammer falls and grants get slashed. Some said there should be grassroots efforts to speak up.\n“As scientists, I think we’re trying (to) make people aware of the consequences of what is happening,” Appel said. “And it’s not pretty. It’s not pretty.”\nDr. Joseph Richardson, Jr., a professor of African-American studies, medical anthropology and epidemiology at the University of Maryland in College Park and signer of the letter, recommended collaboration between institutions and colleagues.\n“We’re going to need to think of more innovative ways to support the work that we’re doing,” Richardson said. “It’ll pull people out of their silos and encourage, hopefully, more scholars to collaborate, because otherwise it’ll just turn into the ‘hunger games,’ where we’re cannibalizing each other for the sake of going after the same small pool of money.”\nJarzynski said the public needs to pressure political leaders to fight the cuts to research. Lyke suggested that universities should work in concert to focus attention on the threats to American scientific dominance.\n“A voice of anger is starting to rise,” Lyke said. “It’s, I hope, a rising tide that is starting to grow.”\nHowever, she said she noticed that many of colleagues and fellow scientists have struggled to speak up out of fear of losing their jobs. Lyke said that the letter crafted by the National Academies was a good step in the right direction, but it would only be effective if it leads to effective action.\n“I don’t want to be looking back in twenty years as someone who didn’t say something, and then the climate completely collapses in terms of our role in science in the world,” Lyke said.\nCNS Washington reporter Jade Tran contributed to this story."

    "title": "D.C.’s Go-Go Museum showcases the music genre’s local roots, global influence",
    "content": "WASHINGTON—In the Anacostia Neighborhood lies a tribute to a genre of music at the core of Washington culture—the Go-Go Museum  Café. \nFounded by Ronald Moten, a community advocate, the museum is a symbol of the ongoing push to preserve and honor the soulful, rhythmic sound that deeply resonates with D.C.s Black residents. \nThe museum grew out of a grassroots movement, Don’t Mute DC, which recently celebrated its sixth anniversary of championing go-go music. Don’t Mute DC, founded by Moten and American University professor Natalie Hopkinson, began on April 7, 2019, when residents rallied to defend go-go music on a beloved corner near Howard University—7th Street and Florida Avenue.\nWhat started as a protest over a noise complaint quickly evolved into a broader conversation about gentrification, racial justice and the city’s cultural identity. \nMoten and Hopkinson’s efforts eventually led to go-go music becoming the official music of Washington when Mayor Muriel Bowser signed the Go-Go Music of the District of Columbia Designation Act of 2020.\nOn Feb. 19 of this year, the fifth anniversary of the signing, the Go-Go Museum  Café had its official opening in its Anacostia location. \nThe front desk of the Go-Go Museum  Café on April 5, 2025. (Emely Miranda-Aguilar/Capital News Service)\n“Go-go is very exciting, and there’s a lot happening in it,” Hopkinson, who is also the museum’s chief curator, said. “I was fascinated by just the live culture, the theme, the vibe, the energy, the fashion … the very free way that young people express themselves.”\nGo-go music was created in the 1970s by guitarist Chuck Brown, who earned the title “Godfather of Go-Go” for blending funk, jazz, soul, RB, Latin rhythms, and African call-and-response into a unique sound. In 1972, with his newly formed group, the Soul Searchers, Brown recorded his first hit, “We the People.”\n\nThough the museum opened its doors in 2025, it has existed since 2020. Due to the pandemic, the museum held virtual events, including a conversation with Ta-Nehisi Coates, an early go-go scholar. The museum also had a two-year residency at the Kennedy Center. \nIn November 2023, the Go-Go Museum became mobile, functioning as a pop-up museum with smaller versions of its current exhibits and a stage for performances. The museum held a soft launch for its permanent site a year later.\nThe museum covers all aspects of go-go music—from the influence of street art to Afro-modernity. The museum displays fun facts, pictures and mementos of Brown and the genre’s history.\nPercussion instruments, including a drum set and conga drums, sit on a stage in the lower level of the Go-Go Museum  Café on April 5, 2025. (Emely Miranda-Aguilar/Capital News Service)\nThere are many interactive exhibits, including the “Go-Go Family Tree” and “Ladies To The Front!” which play songs and performances by go-go artists. On the museum’s first floor, underneath three red stars symbolizing Washington’s flag, are multiple screens allowing one to learn about the history of Washington and the role go-go plays in it.\nChuck Brown’s Legacy\nGo-go has since expanded outside the nation’s capital and developed a large international following. Brown often traveled and toured in Europe and Asia. Saxophonist Bryan Mills, a Prince George’s County Public Schools music teacher, began performing with Brown in 1999. Mills recounted a time in the early 2000s when Brown and his group had a gig in Japan. When they got on stage, the crowd was silent.\n“It was quiet as hell,” Mills said. “Those first 10 seconds were like, church. It was quiet. No one was saying anything. But as soon as that beat kicked in, everyone started dancing. It was getting loose.”\n“They couldn’t even speak English, but they knew the words to his song.”\nMills remembered that when they looked out at the audience, they saw Pharrell Williams.\nA display case of Chuck Brown and go-go memorabilia at the Go-Go Museum  Café on April 5, 2025. (Emely Miranda-Aguilar/Capital News Service)\nSaxophonist Mark Williams, director of jazz studies at the University of Maryland, also played with Brown. Williams said that Brown and go-go played a major role in shaping both his music and teaching career.\n“You have to display what you want from the crowd … you are literally the example to them of the party and of the vibe. So thats one thing that I still carry with me to this day,” Williams said.\n“I tell [my students] that they cant just sit there and look bored because then the crowd is going to look bored at them. But if they are actually enjoying the music and creating a vibe on stage, the crowd will just copy and mimic what youre doing,” Williams said. “So that has been a huge lesson that I learned from playing with Chuck Brown.”\nThat energy—of leading with joy and presence—is part of Brown’s legacy.\nWashington continues to honor Brown, who passed away in 2012. There’s Chuck Brown Way, located at the 1900 block of 7th Street and Florida Avenue, Chuck Brown Memorial Park, and now a museum celebrating the go-go genre and culture he helped create."

    "title": "Maryland lawmakers, legal experts press Trump to return Abrego García from El Salvador",
    "content": "WASHINGTON – Lawmakers, legal experts and advocates are continuing the fight to push for the return of Maryland resident Kilmar Abrego García, who was mistakenly deported to CECOT, El Salvador’s most notorious prison, and has not been heard from for over a month.\nMaryland Sen. Chris Van Hollen, a Democrat, traveled to El Salvador Wednesday, where he attempted to visit Abrego García and hold talks with government officials to push for his release and check on his well-being, a promise he made to the man’s family during a press conference in Washington last week.\n“I promised them that I would do everything I could to get him out of CECOT,” Van Hollen said during a press conference in El Salvador. “And I won’t stop trying, and I can assure the president, the vice president, that I may be the first United States senator to visit El Salvador on this issue, but there will be more and there will be more members of Congress coming.”\nVan Hollen said he asked the country’s vice president whether any government had any evidence linking Abrego García to MS-13.\n “They do not,” Van Hollen said, questioning why García is still being held at CECOT. \nEl Salvador Vice President Félix Ulloa told the senator he could not visit Abrego García and that he needed more time. When Van Hollen asked if a visit could happen next week, Félix Ulloa said he couldn’t promise that either. \nA phone or video call requested to check on Abrego García’s health and connect him with his family, so they could hear his voice, was also denied. The only possibility granted, Van Hollen said, was that “maybe” something could be arranged through the U.S. embassy.\nA couple of hours earlier, Maryland Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin blistered the Trump administration for rebuffing appeals to get Abrego García returned. \nWASHINGTON  Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Maryland, tells reporters Wednesday that it is absurd that the Trump administration claims it can do nothing to return Kilmar Abrego Garcia from an El Salvador prison. (Jess Daninhirsch/Capital News Service)\n“The claim that there’s nothing the U.S. government can do is absurd,” Raskin said during a press call-in with legal experts and immigration advocates. “The reason why Mr. Abrego García is in El Salvador is because of an agreement between the U.S. government and the Salvadoran government whereby we’re paying them $6 million for the purpose of holding people that we deport or render to El Salvador. They are very clearly, in a legal sense, our agent in this entire affair.” \nThe Supreme Court ruled on April 7 that the Trump Administration must facilitate Abrego García’s return, but by Monday, El Salvador’s President Nayib Bukele said he could not and would not return him. In a Monday Oval Office meeting, President Donald Trump and Bukele shared the same stance, both stating they would not bring Abrego García back to the United States. Trump also said he was powerless to free García.\n“From the day Donald Trump descended the escalator in Trump Plaza in 2015 to announce his candidacy for president, he has put a target on the backs of immigrants,” said Vanessa Cárdenas, the executive director of America’s Voice, an immigration reform organization, during the call-in. “What we saw this week from the White House should shake every American who cares about the rule of law in our democracy.”\nAlso on Wednesday, District Judge James E. Boasberg in Washington threatened to open a contempt inquiry into the administration, calling its actions ‘willful disregard’ in the context of temporarily halting deportations. Boasberg said he found probable cause to hold the administration in contempt over broader issues with deportation flights. \nAttorney General Pam Bondi on Wednesday was adamant about doing nothing to help Abrego Garcia.\n“President Bukele said he was not sending him back. Thats the end of the story,” she told reporters. “If he wanted to send him back, we would give him a plane ride back. There was no situation, ever, where he was going to stay in this country. None.”\nDuring a Fox News appearance on Monday, Bondi said Abrego García was “not a Maryland man,” further denying his status as a legally protected immigrant and echoing the claims of Bukele, calling him a terrorist and an MS-13 gang member.\n“The hypocrisy of now taking the rhetoric that ‘we made a mistake’ to ‘he’s a terrorist’ is nothing more than a bald-faced lie,” David Leopold, America’s Voice’s legal advisor and the chair of immigration practice at UB Greensfelder, a law firm in Washington, said in the call-in.\nLeopold said that Abrego García was granted lawful status in 2019 to live and work in the United States by the Immigration Court under the Department of Justice when Trump was president.\n“They (the immigration court) go through background, they go through criminal history, they go through a whole array of checks to make sure the individual that they are allowing to stay in the United States is acceptable and is not in any way going to be a community threat. And that’s what happened here,” Leopold said.\nRaskin said that Abrego García, who has no criminal record, has won his case at every level of the court system, including in the Supreme Court. \n“It’s pretty amazing that there’s a nine-zero decision from the Supreme Court, which was very much created in Trump’s own image, telling him that he must comply with the due process imperative of the Constitution,” Raskin said. “He should not be in a position of thumbing his nose at the U.S. Supreme Court, which he had bragged about so many times.”\nRaskin suggested history is repeating itself. \n“We’re living in a time very much like the Alien and Sedition Acts of the 1790s,” Raskin said, which were laws aimed at restricting free speech and the rights of immigrants. “There are principles very much at the heart of this struggle right now, and that’s the essential message that we need to get through to the country.”\n\nKilmar Abrego García: A Timeline\n\n\n\nMarch 28, 2019: Abrego García was arrested and ICE took him into federal immigration detention.\nApril 24, 2019: Abrego García was taken to a removal hearing before an immigration judge. His attorney applied for his release on bail, but ICE opposed the application, arguing that local police had identified him as a “verified” active gang member and was therefore a threat to the community.\nOctober 2019: Judge David M. Jones granted Abrego García’s request for “withholding of removal” based on his fear of persecution by the aforementioned gang. The government did not appeal, so Jones’s ruling is now final.\nMarch 12, 2025: Abrego García was driving with his disabled 5-year-old child and was pulled over by ICE without a warrant.\nMarch 15, 2025: Abrego García was sent to CECOT, a mega-prison in El Salvador. On the same day, the Trump administration deported 238 Venezuelans to El Salvador as well.\nMarch 24, 2025: Abrego García’s attorneys filed suit in Greenbelt, Maryland, asking U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis to order him returned.\nApril 9, 2025: Abrego García’s wife, Jennifer, spoke at a press conference in a Capitol administrative building.\nApril 10, 2025: The Supreme Court ruled 9-0 in a per curiam order that the government facilitate his return.\nApril 16, 2025: Maryland senator Chris Van Hollen lands in El Salvador, hoping to meet with Abrego García and check in on him.\n\n\n\nTimeline: (Jess Daninhirsch/Capital News Service)\nSource: Abrego Garcia and MS-13: What Do We Know? by Lawfare Media"

    "title": "Environmentalists worry what the plane-copter collision left behind in the Potomac River",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  Members of the Potomac Riverkeeper Network are concerned about the potential environmental impact on the river of the Jan. 29 collision between an American Airlines jet and a Black Hawk helicopter.\nVarious agencies involved in the response and investigation of the accident, which killed 67 people, so far have no plans for testing the Potomac for remaining traces of jet fuel and debris.\nWhile the Potomac Riverkeeper Network could sample the water, the cost can be upwards of $600. Dean Naujoks, a decade-long member of the Riverkeeper Network, said that another volunteer from the organization collected water samples but froze them until the organization could get the funds to test it.\n“In a perfect world, we’d have all the resources, and we’d have $10,000 set aside for something like this,” Naujoks said. “But, you know, we’re a non-profit organization, and we don’t, and so we’re just scrambling trying to get free help anywhere we possibly could for the sampling.”\nThe amount of fuel that spilled from the two aircraft has not been made public. Once it is, organizations such as the Potomac Riverkeeper Network could use the existing models and maps of the river to pinpoint locations in the river where the water still might contain contaminants.\nThe CRJ700, the type of jet involved in the accident, has a maximum fuel capacity of 2,925 gallons. The American jet had been moments from completing its roughly two-hour-and-forty-minute flight from Wichita at the time of the accident. The Black Hawk helicopter, also known as a Sikorsky UH-60, has a fuel capacity of 360 gallons.\nNaujoks was one of the first people to respond to the crash. With permission from the FBI, Naujoks waded downriver from the crash the day after the accident to assess the spread of contaminants visible on the water’s surface.\n“It was an intense situation to deal with,” Naujoks said. “It was nerve-wracking being out there, and it was just a sad – probably saddest day ever on the Potomac River.”\nNaujoks spoke about his experiences in a webinar session by the Riverkeeper Network as a part of its “Water Wednesdays” series. He said he wanted to ‘clear the air’ about why he was allowed to search the site so soon after the crash and what he did there. Due to Naujoks’ keen knowledge of the river, he was a key resource for first responders and received permission to be near the site.\nIn the webinar, Naujoks said he felt “obligated” to search in areas where boats do not typically navigate, such as Smoots Cove and Oxon Cove, because the first responders did not go there immediately.\nAn American Airlines jet lands at the Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. (Jess Daninhirsch/Capital News Service)\nThe last pieces of the wreckage were removed a week after the accident, but Naujoks worried that there could still be jet fuel, residue of other chemicals, and debris in and along the nearby shoreline of the Potomac. He suspected that heavier parts of the fuel may have sunk into the river.\nWeston Slaughter, a Ph.D student at the University of Maryland in the Department of Geology, had a similar suspicion. Slaughter, who works in the biogeochemistry lab under Dr. Sujay Kaushal, works on the Potomac River frequently, conducting organic carbon analysis.\nSlaughter visited the crash site two days after the incident, and he visited it again two weeks later to study the sediment. On his second visit, he said he saw yellow insulation foam from the plane still remaining in the water.\n“When this happened, it felt like it was really important to sample (the water). If we didn’t have the samples then, then we definitely would not have been able to see what was going on,” Slaughter said. “Since then, we’ve been working on figuring out, are some of the instruments that we have capable of detecting specifically a signature jet fuel versus other carbon compounds?”\nIt rained on the day he set out to explore the area, two days after the crash. He theorized that the precipitation could have spread remaining jet fuel compounds to other areas of the watershed, potentially prolonging the compounds’ residence time in the water.\nSlaughter believes that this incident highlighted the importance of rapid responses to collect scientific information and comprehensive data to be shared with the public for the greater benefit of public health.\n“From a public health and environmental health consideration, that does deserve that attention,” Slaughter said. “I feel like the lack of overall capacity for there to have been a definitive scientific response to an event like this, to be able to attempt to quantify the contaminant and the exposure risk…It does seem like the kind of thing that it would be good for us to be, as a society, prepared to respond to in like in a timely fashion for protecting people.”\nEven if there is no long-term cause for concern, Slaughter believes that it is important for organizations and labs to continue researching long-term effects, monitoring sediments, and keeping an eye on water quality because that insight could be helpful for public health in the future.\nChristopher Overcash, adjunct professor and program manager in the Department of Environmental Health and Engineering in the Whiting School of Engineering at Johns Hopkins University, echoed Slaughter’s concerns.\n“There are remnants of jet fuel that are water soluble, containing xylene and ethylbenzene that are toxic to aquatic life, so while the material is in there, it could certainly still impact the fish and other aquatic organisms,” Overcash said. “(The) way that it could have an environmental impact would be sediment contamination, and that would rely on there being suspended sediment in the river…and lead to localized contamination on the bottom of the river.”\nOvercash, who is an expert on the dynamics and flow of the river system, emphasized that while it is unlikely that there are still contaminants in the water, the importance of testing it for both confirmation purposes and for future use and research should not be overlooked.\nWhen asked whether or not he thought testing should happen, Overcash said, “I think it should to get ultimate confirmationand I would also say not just testing of the water column itself at the location, but also potentially some sediment samples near where they removed the aircraft debris.”\nThe National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is currently investigating the probable cause of the crash, and it will likely be able to report the amount of jet fuel that was in the plane and the helicopter in its final report, according to NTSB chief of media relations Eric Weiss.\nThe D.C. Department of Energy  Environment (DOEE) said that it had no plans to sample the water, unless requested by the U.S. Coast Guard.\nThe Coast Guard also did not sample the water, nor did any other agency involved in the cleanup process. Micheal Rhue, a marine science technician for the Coast Guard, said that if the spillage had been oil or diesel fuel, there would have been more cause for concern because those materials do not dissolve as easily as jet fuel. Rhue said that most of the jet fuel evaporated after the first day.\nAdditionally, the Coast Guard often samples water when there is a spill from which the source is unknown. Because it is known that the jet fuel came from the plane crash, Rhue said, the testing was unnecessary.\nJay Apperson, the communications director of the Maryland Department of the Environment, said that fuel leakage was the primary environmental concern. Apperson said that when exposed to air, the jet fuel becomes volatile and evaporates from the water quickly.\nThe plane crash occurred close to the Anacostia River and the Washington Channel, both of which feed into the Potomac River.\nNaujoks said he found wreckage debris and smelled the jet fuel the day after the accident farther south of the crash site: around the Woodrow Wilson Bridge and in Oxon Cove, all the way downriver to National Harbor.\nThe Maryland Department of the Environment’s jurisdiction ends north of the Woodrow Wilson Bridge, so that is where the agency halted its search for any debris or fuel. The department was in a support role during the cleanup process, according to Apperson.\nThe Interstate Commission on the Potomac River Basin (ICPRB) does not give a definitive answer on whether or not it is safe to swim in the river, although the Potomac and Anacostia Riverkeepers regularly update the bacteria levels. Despite this, the river is regularly used recreationally, and the Potomac Riverkeeper Network had been planning its annual Polar Bear Plunge at National Harbor on Feb. 10.\nAfter the accident, the organization rescheduled the event and converted it to a virtual event.\n“I became increasingly concerned about if that event was going to happen, if three hundred people (were) going in the river, not only does it not look good in light of the tragedy, but we had real concerns about what that might mean for water quality and overall public health,” Naujoks said.\nAbout five million people get their drinking water from the Potomac River. Renee Bourassa, communications director at ICPRB, said that the commission was not involved in the accident cleanup process, as its main concern would have been about the drinking water sources. The crash occurred in an area downstream of the primary drinking water intake sites at Great Falls and Little Falls.\nAccording to the Potomac Conservancy Report Card, the primary source of pollution in the Potomac River is urban runoff, which is one of the leading causes of pollution in the United States.\nNot much is known about the long-term effects of jet fuel exposure, according to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, but short-term effects include skin irritation and respiratory issues.\nCNS Washington reporter Jade Tran contributed to this story."

    "title": "Lawmakers join wife of mistakenly deported Maryland man to demand his return",
    "content": "UPDATE: The Supreme Court on Thursday evening ruled that the Trump administration must facilitate the return to the United States of Kilmar Abrego Garcia. Following that decision, U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis of Maryland directed the administration to bring back Abrego Garcia as soon as possible.\nWASHINGTON – Members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, joined by Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Maryland, and Rep. Glenn Ivey, D-Maryland, demanded answers Wednesday about the mistaken deportation of Maryland resident Kilmar Abrego Garcia.\nVan Hollen said a Maryland judge determined there were “no legal grounds whatsoever for his arrest, detention or removal.” He added that the judge found Abrego Garcia’s deportation “wholly lawless” and warned of the dangers he now faces in a maximum-security prison in El Salvador.\n“JD Vance lied through his teeth when he said that Kilmar had been convicted of a crime in the United States. Absolutely false,” Van Hollen said at a Capitol Hill press conference. “The Vice President should apologize to the family — and he should do it now.”\nThat concern was echoed by Ivey, who criticized the administration’s inaction to bring Abrego Garcia home.\n“I think it’s time for them to put up or shut up. Bring him back, let’s get him in court, have the day in court,” Ivey said. “They sent him to one of the most notorious prisons in the Western Hemisphere.”\nOn March 15, immigration authorities deported Abrego Garcia to a notorious mega prison in El Salvador, which lawmakers described as “heinous” and known for torturing inmates. Abrego Garcia fled the country at age 16 to escape threats of gang violence, murder and extortion. A U.S. immigration judge granted him legal protection from deportation in 2019, a protection that has since been reversed under the Trump administration.\nAbrego Garcia’s wife, Jennifer Vasquez Sura, stood beside lawmakers and signs reading “BRING KILMAR HOME,” next to a picture of him holding one of his children, with tears in her eyes.\n“It’s been 28 days since I last saw my husband. Since his children hugged him, since his mother has kissed him, since his brother has talked to him,” she said.\nWASHINGTON  Rep. Adriano Espaillat, D-New York, and chairman of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, said at a Capitol Hill press conference Wednesday that he plans to send a letter directly to the president of El Salvador to urge the release of a Maryland man mistakenly sent to a prison in that country. (Giuseppe LoPiccolo/Capital News Service)\nCourts have ruled that his deportation should have never happened, she said, and that her “life partner” should have been home “50 hours ago.”\nShe addressed her husband directly, looking straight into the cameras: “If you can hear me, I’m still fighting for you — your brother, your mother, your children. We’re still fighting for you, and we’re not gonna give up hope.\nRep. Juan Vargas, D-California, thanked Vasquez Sura for her tears, saying her words and emotions cut to the heart of a wider national crisis.\n“Your tears were joined with the tears of many people in my district in San Diego, and they form a stream. And throughout this country, they form a river, a river appears because of what’s happening to families,” Vargas said.\nHe compared Abrego Garcia’s disappearance to his own experiences during the 1980s in El Salvador as a Jesuit, when violence often led to people vanishing without a trace.\n“I never thought that something like that would happen in my own country, where masked people that work for the government would come abduct people off the street,” he said.\nRep. Jamie Raskin, D-Maryland, echoed that concern, saying the Trump administration is trying to wash its hands of what happens after deportation.\n“They’re framing us to believe that the U.S. government can pick somebody up off the street, with no due process, ship them to El Salvador — and that’s the end of our story,” Raskin told reporters after the press conference. “We can’t accept that.”\nA letter sent Tuesday night by a group of 25 senators, led by Van Hollen, called on Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to answer seven specific questions about how DHS handles immigrants with legally protected status. The request follows a Supreme Court decision that temporarily paused a lower court’s order for ICE to return Abrego Garcia to the United States.\nNot all criticism was directed at the Trump administration.\nRep. Adriano Espaillat, D-New York, and chairman of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, said he plans to send a letter directly to the Salvadoran government asking for Abrego Garcia’s release ahead of Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele’s upcoming visit to meet with President Donald Trump on April 14.\n“We don’t know his condition, the family deserves to know his condition, and if they don’t tell us, we will visit the prison ourselves to go visit him,” Espaillat said.\nWhen asked if this effort would make a difference, Espaillat responded by saying that hearing Vasquez Sura speak should certainly make a difference in the nation.\n“Public sentiment in this nation, as Abraham Lincoln said right in the middle of the Civil War, is everything,” Espaillat said. “Jennifer’s story could move mountains, not just bring him back home.”\nLawmakers warned that Abrego Garcias deportation reveals a pattern of stripping immigrants of not only their legal protections, but their worth. They added that Republican leaders are fueling a narrative that dehumanizes the immigrant community and takes away their due process.\n“You owe this man’s family answers, and you owe the American people an explanation for why the Constitution seems optional in their own country,” Rep. Nydia Velázquez, D-New York, said."

    "title": "Maryland delegation appalled by Trump tariffs amid stock market plunge",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  Maryland Democratic lawmakers expressed dismay Thursday over President Donald Trump’s tariffs on all imported goods, a move that caused the financial markets to tumble and some manufacturers to announce layoffs.\n“For years, we’ve been told to take Donald Trump seriously, but not literally. We were told his incoherent economic philosophy and outrageous rhetoric were merely negotiating tactics for a master in the art of the deal,” Rep. Steny Hoyer said Thursday. “What he did yesterday ought to throw any such nuanced interpretation aside. What he did was stand in the Rose Garden and proudly announce the largest tax increase on middle-class Americans in our nation’s history – one that will cost the average American family thousands of dollars each year.”\nThe United States will impose a minimum baseline of 10% tariffs, with higher, “reciprocal” tariffs on nations that tax U.S. exports, including a 20% rate for the European Union and 34% duty on China, Trump said Wednesday, which he coined “Liberation Day.”\nThe White House said other countries have taken advantage of the U.S. — the world’s leader in consumer spending — with high tariffs and other trade barriers, which Trump pledged to stop. The president declared a national emergency in an executive order Wednesday, citing economic and national security implications as a result of the trade imbalance.\nStellantis, maker of more than a dozen vehicle brands including Chrysler, Dodge and Jeep, announced it was pausing production at its plants in Canada and Mexico and temporarily furloughing about 900 U.S. workers. Appliance manufacturer Whirlpool announced layoffs of 650 employees.\n“It’s not Liberation Day, it is a National Sales Tax Day, because that will be the result of the president’s action,” Sen. Chris Van Hollen said Wednesday. “We’ve heard the president make a lot of promises about what these tariffs will do, it’s like a miracle cure. They’re going to revive American manufacturing, they’re going to stop fentanyl, they’re going to balance our budget, they’re going to make all of us rich and all those other countries are going to pay for it. The problem is, none of that is true. Other countries don’t pay these tariffs, we do.”\nEconomists estimate the tariffs will cost the typical American household $4,200 more per year, the National Association of Home Builders said it will make new homes cost up to $10,000 more and a researcher at Cornell University said a new car could cost up to $20,000 more as a result, Van Hollen said. He also expects opposing countries to retaliate, causing a trade war.\nThese tariffs could also have a heightened effect on Marylanders through the Port of Baltimore.\n“The 25% tax on foreign cars, in particular, could devastate the Port of Baltimore, which supports nearly 140,000 jobs ranging from longshoreman to truck drivers,” Rep. Johnny Olszewski wrote on X. “The Port, only recently reopened after the collapse of the Key Bridge, is the nation’s top importer of foreign-made vehicles. The hardworking Marylanders who rely on the Port, along with factory workers and farmers around the country, are all at risk of losing their livelihoods.”\nIn response, Sen. Angela Alsobrooks sought unanimous consent Wednesday for her proposed Tariff Transparency Act, which would demand a nonpartisan study on the tariffs to see how they affected Americans, but Republicans blocked it.\nMaryland’s lone Republican in Congress, Rep. Andy Harris, voiced his support of the tariffs on X: “President Trump’s reciprocal tariffs will put the American worker first and bring fairness back to international trade. America is being respected again.”\nBut the stock market has sided with the opposition. The Dow Jones closed down nearly 1,700 points Thursday. The SP 500 fell more than 4% Thursday, its worst day since 2020, while European and Asian stock markets also took dives.\n“The stock market is plunging in response to reckless tariffs,” Rep. April McClain Delaney said. “Yet another example of how short-sighted economic policies hurt hard-working Americans. These tariffs impact more than big corporations; they raise prices for families, threaten jobs and shake investor confidence.”\nRep. Glenn Ivey noted on X: “On this day in 1948, Former President Harry S. Truman signed the Marshall Plan into law, which would stimulate and support the economies of western and southern European countries affected by WWII. That is diplomacy. Yesterday, we witnessed a President upend the world order and cripple our allies only to line his billionaire buddies’ pockets. We won’t stand for it.”"

    "title": "Education Department employees cheered as they leave, warn of impacts of cuts on the future",
    "content": "WASHINGTON – Suitcases and large cardboard boxes rolled across the pavement outside the Department of Education’s offices this week as recently fired federal workers packed up their desks.\nWaiting outside, workers were greeted with claps, cheers and whistles as they emerged from the buildings, some raising their fists in defiance. Colleagues embraced, sharing quiet words or simply holding on. Signs with various messages floated above the crowd, most thanking the workers for their public service.\nWhat began as a smaller “clap out” outside the Office of the State Superintendent of Education (OSSE), home to Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) offices, on Wednesday grew into a larger demonstration by Friday. Fired employees gathered at the Department of Education’s headquarters, joined by advocates rallying in solidarity.\nAbout two weeks ago, workers in the department, which originally had 4,200 employees, began to hear rumblings of a large round of layoffs aimed at reducing the workforce by 50%. Some employees opted for early buyouts, while others took early retirements. The remaining 1,300 employees were subject to “reduction in force” notices, according to former employees Nikki Churchwell, of Calvert County, Maryland, from the Office of Performance and Improvement and Kaitlyn Vitez, of Alexandria, Virginia, from the Office of Communications and Outreach.\nThe U.S. Office of Personnel Management lays out specific procedures for downsizing, which include ranking employees based on seniority and performance. However, Churchwell said the administration altered the way competitive areas were identified to bypass this process.\nWASHINGTONTony Sarmiento and Veronica Greene smile for a photo next to Greenes boxes outside of the Office of the State Superintendent of Education in Washington, D.C. on March 26, 2025. Greene is one of many Department of Education employees who has been laid off recently. (Jess Daninhirsch/Capital News Service)\nVeronica Greene, 56, a nearly retired worker, made her way down the path outside the OSSE, her belongings packed into two cardboard boxes stacked on a dolly. A security guard and another man, also carrying boxes, helped guide the load.\nA car pulled up to the corner of the building, its windows down. A man and a woman inside waved and clapped in support. With teary eyes, Greene said, “These are my colleagues.”\n“We party hard. We love each other. It’s hard to see these people leave because I don’t know if I’ll ever see them again, ” she said. “Some I might, but a lot I might not.”\nDescribing her experience, Greene said that she planned to retire, but this departure was not on her own terms. In just 15 to 20 minutes, the place she had considered home for decades was reduced to two boxes, after dedicating her life to student aid and loan services since 1991.\nHer days were spent answering phones and sorting through mail, but it was in her office in meetings, where she said she witnessed the dedication of her colleagues.\nKelisa Wing, a former employee with the Department of Education, stands beside a box of items from her office on March 28, 2025. (Giuseppe LoPiccolo/Capital News Service)\nKelisa Wing, of Virginia, a former employee with the Office of the Deputy Secretary at the Department of Education who lives in Virginia, was escorted to her workstation around 9 a.m. on Friday with just 30 minutes to pack up her belongings.\nAs she moved through the office, she noticed Homeland Security personnel monitoring the building. By 11 a.m., the walls of her workspace, once decorated with family photos, potted plants and an image of Martin Luther King Jr. from the night before his assassination, were bare.\nEverything had been carefully placed into a sleek black suitcase with a box stacked on top.\n“All I ever wanted to be was an English teacher and look what God did, because of education,” she said. “Education saved my opportunities, so that’s what they want to take away.”\nThough for Wing, the moment was bittersweet. The abrupt departure offered a sense of closure, giving her the chance to say a proper goodbye to colleagues she had worked alongside for years.\n“This is an assault on public education, because people know that education is the great equalizer,” she said. “It is the way that a student, a person like me, who came from nothing from Toledo, Ohio, from nothing, can end up working in a place like this.”\nSupporters gathered with former employees, holding signs of solidarity. One sign, adorned with Cookie Monster, read: Thank you! Gracias! Merci! Salamat!\nTony Sarmiento, a retired worker from Silver Spring, Maryland, who has attended 21 demonstrations in support of federal employees since the new administration took office, stood beside Greene, snapping photos and helping her with her belongings.\nHe said firings like these often led to deep emotional struggles, with laid-off workers battling depression and self-blame.\n“So, even with the completely irrational, cruel way these closings are happening,” he said, “there’s a phenomenon where workers are so depressed, they aren’t going to blame the right person.”\nBill Bimber, a retired science and technology high school teacher with 34 years of experience in northern Virginia schools, spent many years without computers to teach his students computer repair. If it weren’t for funding programs created by the Department of Education, he may never have received computers to teach his class.\nBimber expressed his concerns that if the department is experiencing massive layoffs, programs like this that provide equipment and materials to students may no longer get off the ground.\n“I know how programs from this agency, this department, have affected schools over the years, and it’s largely invisible, but it’s huge,” Bimber said. “It really is enormous what they do.”\nWASHINGTONJackie Murray (right) talks on the phone outside of the Department of Education in Washington, D.C. on March 28, 2025. She wears a shirt that says I worked for the Department of Education and all I got was this shirt. (Jess Daninhirsch/Capital News Service)\nDressed in a Department of Education graphic tee, Washington resident Jackie Murray approached her firing with grace  after 40 years in communications and outreach  with a positive outlook on her future. After being placed on administrative leave over two months ago, the popular Murray bounced around the outside of the building with a smile and laughter.\nShe responded to a question about her next steps, saying, “My mouth moves a lot, so it needs to get paid because it has to eat, you know.”\nFor her, a support system of girlfriends, music, and scripture was key during moments like this that felt shared by many federal workers across the Washington region.\n“Find you a support group that has accepted this, because there are still individuals, um, that I know who have not fully accepted this,” she added, offering advice to those in her situation.\nIn the coming days, there will be debates about what form the department should take and how programs should be implemented, Vitez said.\n“At the end of the day, we need to do what’s best for schools…and for students and provide them the most resources and support to get the job done,” she said. “And people need more support, not less.”"

    "title": "Van Hollen, Subramanyam lead Democrats against Trump’s efforts to move federal agencies",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  Maryland and Virginia Democratic lawmakers are proposing legislation aimed at preventing costly federal agency moves pushed by the Trump administration.\nSen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Maryland, and Rep. Suhas Subramanyam, D-Virginia, are sponsoring companion bills that would require federal agencies to conduct and share comprehensive cost-benefit analyses with Congress and the public before permanent relocations.\nTheir goal there, we should be clear, is to pressure federal employees who work in those agencies into quitting,” Van Hollen said at a press conference Thursday. “And when you do that, you of course lose enormous expertise, and you lose the important services that those individuals are providing.”\nThe introduction follows a Feb. 26 memo from the Office of Personnel Management and the Office of Management and Budget, in which the Trump administration gave federal agencies until April 14 to propose relocations from the Washington area to lower-cost regions.\n“We want to make sure that before that happens, we ask ourselves some simple questions…Is it actually going to improve services? Is it actually going to be cost-effective?” Van Hollen said. “The American taxpayers deserve answers to those questions before they make a very costly move that will jeopardize and sabotage the services provided to the American people.”\nThe two Democrats were joined by fellow Maryland Democratic Reps. Steny Hoyer, Jamie Raskin, Sarah Elfreth, Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton, D-District of Columbia, and Rep. Don Beyer, D-Virginia, all cosponsors of the bill. Among other cosponsors are Maryland Sen. Angela Alsobrooks and Rep. April McClain Delaney, Virginia Sens. Mark Warner and Tim Kaine, and Virginia Reps. Gerry Connolly and Eugene Vindman, all Democrats.\n“Every one of my colleagues wants to get rid of fraud, waste and abuse…but that rhetoric (from the current administration) is a cover for an agenda that is perverse and contrary to the interests of the United States of America,” Hoyer said. “If our colleagues across the aisle genuinely share that objective, theyll support this bill.”\nVan Hollen first introduced the COST of Relocations Act in 2020 and updated it in 2023, but it failed to advance past the Senate floor both times. Old versions of the bill required federal agencies seeking to relocate more than 5 percent or more than 100 of its employees to conduct a cost-benefit analysis.\n“We hoped (the bill) wouldnt be necessary again, but it is. Its necessary in order to stop Donald Trump and Elon Musk from wasting American taxpayer dollars by sabotaging services that the American public depends on,” Van Hollen said.\nDuring the first Trump administration, the National Institute of Food and Agriculture and the Economic Research Service were abruptly relocated from Washington to Kansas City, Missouri, nearly 1,000 miles away. More than 500 employees were given just 33 days to decide whether to lose their jobs or uproot their lives, NPR reported.\nNearly half of the workforce left, and staff with at least two years of experience at these agencies dropped from 83% in 2018 to 27% in 2021, Subramanyam said. As a result, grants for nutrition assistance and food safety were delayed for months, and critical agricultural research was drastically reduced or eliminated.\n“Former White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney suggested that moving the agency outside the D.C. region was an effective way to get staff to quit … and now the second Trump administration is using that strategy on steroids,” Subramanyam said.\nVan Hollen emphasized that this is an Trump-Musk attempt to “impose trauma” on federal workers, a reference to private remarks about federal workers delivered last year by Russell Vought, the director of the Office of Management and Budget and proponent of Trump’s Project 2025, which the lawmakers repeatedly quoted throughout the presser.\nHoyer doubled down, saying, “They want to force federal workers to uproot their lives, to take their children out of school, to sell their homes, to break their leases, all with little or no advance notice.”\nThe Washington region is home to nearly 20 percent of all federal employees. Subramanyam warned that agency relocations would have a devastating impact on the local economy.\n“American families will not be better off if we decimate critical health and safety agencies with poorly planned relocations,” Subramanyam said. “Its not just our constituents that will be hurt. Itll be all American people. And if youre going to relocate a federal agency and disrupt the services it provides to the public for several years, you should justify it to the American taxpayer and to Congress.”\nVan Hollen said that he does not feel hopeful about the legislation passing in the Republican-controlled Congress, but he said he strongly believes in sending a message.\n“(Cost-benefit analyses are) needed more than ever right now, and we should be getting those answers,” Van Hollen said. “We dont expect that (the current administration) is going to do it because thats not their purpose. And so were here to blow the whistle on whats happening.”"

    "title": "Van Hollen, other Senate Democrats call Social Security nominee unfit",
    "content": "WASHINGTON – Maryland Sen. Chris Van Hollen and some other Senate Democrats on Wednesday said President Donald Trump’s nominee to head the Social Security Administration, Frank Bisignano, could jeopardize benefits for seniors and Americans with disabilities.\n“We’re here to blow the whistle on and say that the nominee they’ve put forward in the Social Security Administration is unfit to protect the promise of Social Security for the American people,” Van Hollen said at a press conference.\nBisignano said Tuesday at his Senate Finance Committee confirmation hearing he had no contact with billionaire Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which has made efforts to reduce the size of the Social Security’s workforce by 7,000 people.\nBut Democratic lawmakers on Wednesday said Bisignano’s statement was false.\nSen. Ron Wyden, D-Oregon, said he received an account from a former senior Social Security official about Bisignano’s involvement in the downsizing of the agency.\n“This nominee, Frank Bisignano, lied to the Senate Finance Committee about his involvement with DOGE since his nomination in December,” Wyden said. “The whistleblower reached out to my staff and their testimony shows that the nominee (Bisignano) appears to be the puppet master behind the chaos of Social Security.”\n“He (Bisignano) handpicked DOGE agents and pressured Social Security employers to cut corners to get them on the job faster,” Wyden said. “He told Social Security staff not to hire anybody without his explicit approval. He was aware of plans to shutter regional offices, close the offices of Civil Rights, anti-fraud and modernization. He was aware of DOGE’s plans to reduce the workforce by thousands of people. He was also aware of sweeping personal data that DOGE agents were requesting, and that those requests flew in the face of privacy law and agency safeguards to ensure America’s most valuable personal information is protected.”\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-New York, said the Trump Administration “is rigging the system for billionaires while stealing from the elderly, from the disabled to cut taxes for their billionaire club.”\nSchumer added that Trump vowed to preserve Social Security during his campaign but he is dismantling the agency and is likely to destroy the agency with Bisignano’s nomination.\n“I’ve known this guy for 20 years,” Schumer said. “He’s a cutter. Companies bring him in to slash benefits, workersThis man should not be running for Social Security.”\nBisignano, 65, has been chairman of Fiserv, a financial services company, since 2020.\nAbout 72.5 million people receive Social Security benefits.\nIn addition to cuts to its staff, Social Security is slated to close 60% of its regional offices. Such changes, critics charge, are efforts to cripple the agency."

    "title": "GOP-controlled panel rejects Mfume’s efforts to get documents on federal firings",
    "content": "WASHINGTON — House Republicans have rejected an effort by Maryland Democratic Rep. Kweisi Mfume to obtain Trump administration documents regarding the firings of federal employees.\n“This resolution of inquiry is an extraordinary step that we are forced to take…after the administration has failed to respond to over six requests from members of this committee for information,” Mfume said during a House Oversight and Government Reform Committee markup hearing Tuesday.\nMfume’s resolution, introduced earlier this month, requested that President Donald Trump provide documents and information to Congress related to the termination, removal, placement on administrative leave and reassignment of federal employees, including inspectors general that were fired in recent weeks.\nMfume’s measure also requested documents from the Office of Personnel Management on the firing of employees working in diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility programs in the federal government.\n“These workers deserve answers. They deserve justice,” Rep. Ayanna Pressley, D-Massachusetts, said.\nThe Republican-controlled panel rejected the resolution on a party-line vote, 23-21.\nMfume said the resolution was an opportunity for constituents to gain insight into the reasoning behind the Trump administration’s decision to fire federal employees and allow Congress to “demand real, intentional oversight.”\n“Americans have every right and every expectation to know how these terminations were made,” Mfume said.\nMfume added that everybody is impacted by the firings of federal workers because it extends the wait times for people trying to access government services like Social Security. He said that federal grants also have been affected due to the reduced size of staff at federal agencies.\nCommittee Chairman James Comer, R-Kentucky, said the resolution was an attempt by Democrats to distract Trump and his administration from bringing accountability and efficiency to government.\n“Instead of finding areas of agreement with President Trump and his administration, committee Democrats are refusing to acknowledge obvious government waste and are obstructing common sense reform,” Comer said, urging his Republican colleagues to oppose Mfume’s resolution.\nDemocratic Rep. Dave Min of California said the resolution of inquiry was a necessary step for Congress to reclaim its authority in the midst of federal worker firings.\n“It’s about reestablishing trust in our institutions and reaffirming our commitment to accountability and the rule of law and the Constitution,” Min said.\nMfume told Capital News Service that nobody has the right to dismantle federal government services that people rely on and provide the livelihoods of federal workers."

    "title": "As Black Lives Matter Plaza becomes rubble, onlookers mourn symbol of hope",
    "content": "WASHINGTON – Chunks of concrete streaked with bright yellow paint that just days ago boldly spelled out “Black Lives Matter” sat in piles of rubble on 16th Street as workers in hard hats and neon vests chipped away at the pavement.\nA gray and blue bucket labeled “Mobil Synthetic Lubricant” rested beside a slab of concrete as a worker in jeans drilled it into fragments of pavement.\nThe drone of the drill on 16th Street, N.W., was so loud that an ambulance speeding down nearby K Street became barely audible, swallowed by the incessant buzzing of the machinery.\n“Donald, you can’t turn your head? You don’t have to look out that window, I promise you,” Karen Byrd, a 59-year-old chef from Columbus, Ohio, said after surveying the destruction and directing her plea to the White House two blocks away.\nA week after D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser announced the mural’s removal — following pressure from the Republican-controlled Congress — workers chipped away at the street. The mural, painted in 2020 after George Floyd’s killing and the tear-gassing of D.C. protesters, faded into chalky dust and murky puddles. Every minute, more of the 16-letter statement disappeared.\nWASHINGTON  A construction worker removes pavement from the Black Lives Matter Plaza in Washington on Wednesday. (Giuseppe LoPiccolo/Capital News Service)\nAs the drill chewed away at the word “MATTER” — the side of the three-word message closest to the White House — Giselle Mörch, a 64-year-old from Silver Spring, Maryland, paused to capture a video. Her thoughts inevitably turned to the word, the first to be erased. \n“When I was walking to work this morning and taking my photos, it was interesting because it’s like, ‘So, they don’t pick Black to destroy; they pick the word matters to destroy,’” she said. “The climate we live in, everything matters.”\nMörch had heard the street would be renamed to reflect liberty — an idea she found ironic. She said it invited the question: “Liberty, for who?”\nByrd, newly arrived from Ohio, recalled the first time she stood before the mural. The air was alive with celebration and camaraderie. \n“There were so many people around, taking pictures, speakers from different churches, singing,” Byrd said. “It was a glorious time for Black people, and people of color, and white people.”\nWith George Floyd’s 2020 killing captured on video and broadcast everywhere, Byrd said the mural felt like proof that the cries of Black people had finally been heard. For the first time, she said she believed Black lives mattered — not just to one community.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA post shared by Maryland Capital News Service (@cnsmd)\n\n\n\nIn every photo pedestrians take of the erasure, the White House looms in the background. A street once open to celebrate, walk on, and fill cameras with snapshots was now gone. And for what, Byrd asked.\n“Why can’t we just have something of our own? Byrd asked. “We shouldn’t have to fight for a couple of blocks — they have all of D.C.” \nAlthough Byrd said she understood Bowser’s difficult political position, she said she wished it hadn’t happened in Washington, once known as “Chocolate City,” a place that has a predominantly Black population. \nTwo women glanced both ways before crossing the one-way lane beside the street, whispering as they knelt and slipped under the yellow caution tape. One reached out to pluck two small chunks of broken concrete with faint traces of bold yellow street paint — souvenirs small enough to fit in her luggage for the trip back to Rhode Island.\nSoon, other onlookers took turns darting into the street, ducking under the caution tape to claim a piece of history. \nNoticing a pattern, a construction worker stepped forward, guarding the John Deere loader truck piled with cube-shaped street debris. Instead of stopping people from grabbing chunks of the street, he began handing out individually chosen pieces to the small crowd.\nWASHINGTON  Traces of yellow paint are clearly visible on sections of pavement removed by a front-loader on Wednesday from The Black Lives Matter Plaza in Washington. (Giuseppe LoPiccolo/Capital News Service)\nDr. Donna Huntley-Newby, a 73-year-old nurse from Providence, Rhode Island, stared out at the site, her personal scrap of the street in hand.\n“In all honesty, it’s quite emotional right now,” she said. “For Black America, there’s so many pieces that have been taken away from us. And now we are destroying something that was meaningful.”\nAn engineer paced across the site, his dim sunglasses obscuring his gaze. But the only thing he could have been looking at was what was left of the mural.\nKris Lemoins, 42, lives in Oklahoma, just 100 miles from Tulsa, the site of the 1921 race massacre — one of the worst incidents of racial violence in U.S. history. \n​​His grandparents and parents, born in the ‘30s and ‘50s, lived through the civil rights movement, which he described as far worse than what he’s seeing now. \n“It seems with every step forward, there’s always a step back, and this is that step back,” he said. “I thought it was an organic environment for someone to come and say that ‘We matter’ to like, America. We could at least agree that we’re all Americans and that our histories…intertwine.” \nA woman posing in front of the fading street with her partner told Capital News Service bluntly: “Every two steps of progress we make, the United States of America will show you they can strip that away from you.”\nWASHINGTON  With the White House in the distance, crews continued demolishing the Black Lives Matter Plaza in Washington on Wednesday.

    "title": "At the Department of Education, protests &#8211; and warnings &#8211; over firings",
    "content": "WASHINGTON — Under the scorching sun and dressed in her corporate blouse and skirt, Sarah Newman sat on the stairs leading up to the Department of Education’s entrance. \n“I don’t think I’m doing anything wrong by spending time at the place I otherwise would have been at on a Wednesday,’’ Newman said. A green work bag containing books and an office laptop stood beside her.\nThe department closed its headquarters building in Washington as well as regional offices on Wednesday, but Newman sat on the stairs from 1 p.m. to 6 p.m. to protest her job loss. \nNewman, who lives in northern Virginia and worked with the department for 13 years, was part of staff that faced layoffs on Tuesday that impacted nearly a half of the departments workforce — a reduction from 4,133 to 2,183 workers, according to the agency’s website. \nNewman worked with the Office of Elementary and Secondary Education under the department. Her work entailed administering grant programs to support students from pre-K to 12th grade, and collecting and analyzing data on student performance, testing and graduation rates to ensure the grant programs’ effectiveness. \nNewman said “it feels unjust” losing her job, but while she worries about her future and braces herself for the start of her administrative leave on March 21, she is most fearful of the impacts the staff reduction will have on students.\n“I worry about the persistent kind of inequality that we continue to see,” Newman said. “Kids aren’t getting the same experience as one another and I really worry that it will get significantly worse.”\nWASHINGTON  Two women stand outside of the Department of Education on Wednesday, protesting cuts made to that agencys workforce. (Giuseppe LoPiccolo/Capital News Service)\nThe department’s Office of Civil Rights also faced layoffs on Tuesday, eliminating the entire investigative staff in seven of its 12 regional branches. The civil rights branch is responsible for ensuring equal access to education, prohibiting discrimination in programs or activities that receive federal funds and investigating civil rights violations in schools across the nation.\nThe Department of Education’s other functions include managing federal loans for college, distributing Pell grants, supporting programs for students with disabilities, providing funding to high-poverty schools and supporting students and schools affected by natural disasters.\n“The Department of Education will continue to deliver on all statutory programs that fall under the agency’s purview, including formula funding, student loans, Pell Grants, funding for special needs students and competitive grantmaking,” according to a statement from the agency.\nSecretary of Education Linda McMahon, nominated by President Donald Trump, said in a statement that the staff reduction “reflects the Department of Education’s commitment to efficiency, accountability and ensuring that resources are directed where they matter most: to students, parents and teachers.” \nBut Joe Murphy, who was let go on Tuesday after working at the department for 10 years, said the firing of workers will have a noticeable impact.\n“I’m very afraid that with the elimination of all of the people within these offices in the department, the delivery of the resources to the grantees, those being the states, is going to be delayed or cut off completely,” he told Capital News Service. “If they (the Trump administration) can’t get the grants out at all, and if it’s their goal to save money and stop these grants, that’s against what is written into law by Congress.”\nMurphy, from Dumfries, Virginia, worked as a management and data analyst and carried out duties similar to Newman’s. He said working with the department was rewarding. He reminisced about the time he worked on a project that gave grants to Native American students. \n“It was unbelievably gratifying,” Murphy said. “Because we took a population that is frequently underserved in terms of resources, and it gave us a way of proving that they need more resources.”\nMembers of the public dropped by the department’s building Wednesday to express their dismay about the Trump administrations actions.\nPeople posted signs around the department’s granite garden bed that read “Department of Education is not a ‘Bureaucratic Bloat,’” referencing a statement McMahon made Tuesday on Fox News. Other posters read, “Employers want to hire an educated workforce,” “You did NOT keep ‘all the right people’ … You kept Elon!”\nLesley Fera, who previously worked as a substitute teacher, flew from Los Angeles to Washington to protest against the downsizing of various federal agencies under Trump and billionaire Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Fera said she wanted to show solidarity with workers from the department.\n“I can’t see how this does not affect education and accessibility to education when people are relying on the public school system,” said Fera, who wore a red shirt that read: “Stop the billionaire coup.”\n“My heart is with education and the programs that will be decimated because of this,” she said.\nKaren Sandoe, a retired teacher who taught in southwest Virginia for 30 years and comes from a family of four generations of educators, sat beside a poster she made that said: “(Re) Tired teacher supporting Dept. of Ed.”\n“When history reflects on this, and it will,” Sandoe said, “I want my grandchildren to know that their grandmother stood up for education and for their future.” \nNewman, still sitting on the stairs, sipped from a cup of coffee to get her through the day.\n“This place has been my home away from home,” Newman said about the Education Department. “I feel like I’ve created this life for myself, and I’m proud of that. It feels under attack.”"

    "title": "In crowded town hall, Maryland constituents air worries about government cuts",
    "content": "COLUMBIA, Md.  Hundreds of Maryland constituents turned out at a town hall Tuesday night hosted by Maryland congressional Democrats to voice their concerns over the Trump administrations efforts to break up federal agencies and cut government programs and jobs.\nSens. Chris Van Hollen and Angela Alsobrooks, Rep. Sarah Elfreth and Howard County Executive Calvin Ball fielded questions from an anxious audience in the Howard County Community College gymnasium. Many queries focused on veterans and the Department of Education. The lawmakers asked the media to give audience members anonymity so they could speak freely.\nPresident Donald Trump created on Jan. 20 the Department of Government Efficiency, led by billionaire Elon Musk, with the intention of slashing government funding to reduce taxes. The advisory body has done this primarily through shutting down federal agencies and cutting government jobs. Dozens of lawsuits are challenging the actions.\n“A lot of representatives are talking at Trump,” an audience member told the Democrats, suggesting their party needs to respond to the conservative Project 2025 that has been the foundation of the administration’s program cancellations and mass firings of federal workers. “This document would present to the American people what the Democratic Party stands for.”\nWith nearly 30% of all federal employees claiming veteran status as of September 2024, according to FedScope, multiple questions asked were directed toward veterans’ well-being and benefits.\n“What are each of you doing to help veterans who are negatively impacted by these mass layoffs?” an audience member asked.\n“We’re dealing with a president and an administration that does not respect service and (does) not respect sacrifice,” Van Hollen answered. “As we work, or as you work, to get your jobs back, because you’ve been wrongfully terminated, you can pursue other opportunities.  You can pursue any of those alternatives without giving up or surrendering, in any way, your right to get back the job where you’ve been wrongfully fired.”\nBall also said Howard County hosted a career fair for veterans that featured more than 50 employers and provided resources for veterans who would like to start their own businesses.\nAnother audience member asked if veteran benefits would be attacked as well. Elfreth said she voted against a Republican-crafted House continuing resolution that would cut support to veterans exposed to toxic burn pits but explained that services provided to veterans will be affected by the mass layoffs.\n“The president can say every single day that hes not going to cut Social Security benefits, but if he slashes that workforce by 50 percent, as he has claimed he will, who is going to file that paperwork? Whos going to cut those checks? Who is going to make sure those appeals are heard?” Elfreth said. “So, we are going to see a reduction in services, regardless if he swears up and down he’s not going to touch those benefits.”\nThe same audience member also questioned why Musk has the right to determine federal spending, given that he has billions of dollars in government contracts.\nVan Hollen charged that the Trump administration’s efforts have nothing to do with government efficiency, but rigging the government for people like Musk and other billionaires.\n“As  they’re shutting down things like the (Consumer Finance Protection Bureau), Elon Musk did get another billion-dollar contract from the federal government, the Trump administration, for Starlink,” Van Hollen said. “They are not complying with the conflict-of-interest laws, obviously, or the ethics laws.”\nVan Hollen said Democrats are working on their own tax plan to show the American people that Trump’s plan is for the rich at the expense of everyone else.\nAnother audience member asked what the lawmakers are doing to hold the administration accountable, and then explained how his daughter is studying abroad in Spain but does not know whether she will receive promised funding due to the freezes on the Fulbright Program, which provides study-abroad scholarships.\n“You in Congress have the power of the purse, they don’t,” the audience member said. “This is money that you in Congress allocated to the Department of State, and (the administration) decided that they don’t need to spend it.”\n“There are people now, like your child, stranded overseas,” Van Hollen answered. “We are actually working, right now, on a constituent level to try to make sure we collect the situations, like you find yourself in, and so please make sure that we connect later on.”\nThroughout the night Van Hollen, Alsobrooks and Elfreth expressed frustration that while they were determined to combat the Trump administration and directly address constituent concerns, Democrats are in the minority in the Senate and House, so their ability to act is limited.\n“We will fight tooth and nail, but I will say, at the end of the day  we have a vote, and that vote outcome, of course, depends on who’s in the majority,” Van Hollen said. “We need to have all of you contact everybody you know in communities all over the countryWe need to make sure that our colleagues are not only hearing from Elon Musk and Donald Trump, but that they’re hearing from their constituents from all sides of the aisle.”"

    "title": "On NTSB recommendations, FAA closes helicopter route near DC airport weeks after tragedy",
    "content": "WASHINGTON — The National Transportation Safety Board issued urgent safety recommendations Tuesday, warning that helicopter flights near the Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport pose serious safety risks and one helicopter route should be closed during airport operations.\nHours later, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy accepted the recommendations on behalf of the Federal Aviation Administration, promising long-term changes.\n“Urgent recommendations require immediate action to prevent similar accidents or incidents when we issue them,” NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy said at an NTSB media briefing Tuesday. “We believe a critical safety issue must be addressed without delay.”\nThe recommendations were released alongside a preliminary investigative report on the Jan. 29 midair collision of an American Airlines jetliner and a military helicopter near Reagan National that killed 67 people.\nThe NTSB urged the FAA to ban helicopters from a four-mile stretch over the Potomac River when airport runway 15/33 is in use and to designate an alternative route when the area is closed, according to the published recommendations. The American jet was on final approach to runway 15/33 when the collision occurred.\nHomendy said that there were warning signs before the January collision, citing data detailing more than 15,000 near-collisions between commercial aircraft and helicopters at Reagan National between October 2021 and December 2024. The majority occurred during plane landings and at night, according to the NTSB’s report.\n”We’re in a situation where we’re threading the needle, allowing helicopters to fly down the same airspace as landing aircraft,” Duffy said. “And why this information wasn’t studied and known before January 29 is an important question.”\nFollowing the crash, Duffy restricted helicopter traffic around the airport through the end of March. He said those restrictions will continue in accordance with NTSB recommendations. Duffy said he also spoke with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth about alternative military flight routes, with exceptions for presidential travel, life-saving operations and law enforcement.\nThe preliminary report does not identify any probable causes of the collision, as the NTSB is still in “the fact-finding phase” of its investigation, according to Homendy.\n“We still have a lot of work to do in this investigation, so the report contains only the facts that were able to validate and release at this time,” Homendy said. “The easiest and quickest part of the investigation is determining what happened. The part that takes longer is the how and why.”\nTuesday’s NTSB media briefing was the fifth of its kind since the collision.\nAt a Feb. 14 briefing, Homendy told reporters that investigators believe that the helicopter crew was wearing night vision goggles that would have limited their peripheral vision. She also said that cockpit conversations suggest that the helicopter crew may not have heard key instructions from air traffic controllers and had inaccurate altitude readings in the moments before the crash.\nDuffy criticized the air traffic control system as outdated, relying on 25- to 30-year-old technology, including floppy disks and plug-in headphones, at a separate press conference Tuesday. He pledged to propose a plan in the coming weeks that would revolutionize the “antiquated” technology, seeking congressional approval and funding.\n“We’re at a point where we can do this fast—three and a half to four years for a brand new air traffic control system. Gold plated. Envy of the world,” he said. “It will greatly improve our safety…but its also going to improve the efficiency that we have in American air travel, which I think will mean less delays, less cancellations, and again, better safety.”\nDespite concerns, Homendy reassured travelers.\n“I just flew with my daughter out of DCA…aviation is incredibly safe,” she said. “However, there are safety issues and areas where we need to improve to make sure that we are at zero.”"

    "title": "Maryland&#8217;s Elfreth leads legislative effort to protect fired probationary federal workers",
    "content": "WASHINGTON — Maryland Democratic Rep. Sarah Elfreth introduced legislation Tuesday that would strengthen protections for probationary federal workers who were recently fired by the Trump administration.\nThe Protect Our Probationary Employees Act aims to ensure that recently fired probationary federal employees would be able to reclaim their seniority they accrued from their previous jobs if they were rehired by the government.\n“This challenge that led to this bill impacts every district…red and blue districts alike,” Elfreth told Capital News Service after a press conference at the U.S. Capitol.\nThe bipartisan bill was co-sponsored by Republican Reps. Michael Baumgartner of Washington and Jeff Hurd of Colorado.\nElfreth said the firings also impacted those who were recently promoted and had joined as second- and third-career professionals.\n“If they were promoted, that’s the other kind of story that’s getting lost in this mix right now,” Elfreth said. “People who are mid-career did (a) really great job, earned a promotion. They started their probationary clocks again and they were victims of this mass firing as well.”\nFederal employees are subjected to a probationary period during their first year of service, according to the code of federal regulations.\nFederal rules also state that an employee who has been reinstated to a position in the same agency is not required to serve a new probationary period. However, the employee would need to complete a probationary period when there is a period of time between the old and new positions.\nElfreth was joined by Sen. Van Hollen, D-Maryland, who introduced the companion bill with Sen. Mark Warner, D-Virginia, in the Senate.\nVan Hollen said the firing of probationary employees by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) had nothing to do with employee performance or government efficiency but rather about “rigging the government for people like Elon Musk (who heads the department).”\nElfreth’s Democratic colleagues from Maryland, Reps. Steny Hoyer and Johnny Olszewski, and Rep. Dina Titus, D-Nevada, who are cosponsoring the bill, also attended the Capitol press conference. Maryland Democratic Reps. Jamie Raskin and Glenn Ivey are among other numerous co-sponsors.\nFederal probationary employees who were recently terminated from their jobs shared their stories with reporters.\nAnthony Johnson II, 25, worked for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Chesapeake Bay office in Annapolis, placing scientific buoys and conducting fish monitoring in certain areas of the watershed.\nWASHINGTON  Anthony Johnson II worked for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Chesapeake Bay office in Annapolis until he was fired last month. (Daranee Balachandar/Capital News Service)\nOn Feb. 27, he received an email saying he was terminated from working at the agency because he was “not fit for the job” and his skills do not fit the agency’s current needs.\nJohnson graduated with a masters degree from the University of Miami and had completed eight internships in the last few years, including stints with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the Chesapeake Conservation and Climate Corps.\nHe said the lack of workers would be detrimental to collecting data used by organizations to monitor water quality in the Chesapeake Bay, the Potomac and Choptank Rivers.\n“I hope that this bill allows other federal workers to actually be reinstated back into their job or their position. We’re able to do the important work that everybody was doing at the time,” Johnson told CNS. “And I hope it happens soon.”\nA former visual information specialist at the National Park Service, Madelyn De Manincor said she lost her dream job on Feb. 14 and was faced with having her health insurance cut off.\n“I was crushed to realize the surgery that would greatly improve the quality of my life fell outside that window,” she said. She went on to receive the surgery last week.\nShe said the job terminations were illegal, unfair, cruel and inhumane.\n“We were reduced to names on a list and numbers on a spreadsheet. We are real people,” she said.\nElfreth, elected to the House last November, is the daughter of two civil servants. Her district includes more than 44,000 federal workers.\nEverett Kelley, president of the American Federal of Government Employees (AFGE), said in a statement: This bill, if enacted would allow hardworking civil servants to return to the important work of serving the American people. These employees who joined the federal government were suddenly terminated due to this administration’s disdain for federal employees and desire to privatize their work."

    "title": "Maryland federal properties targeted for sale &#8211; but the list changed (then disappeared)",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  The Trump administration published a list of 443 federal office properties on Tuesday that were tagged as “not core to government operations” and subject to sale, but by Wednesday morning, the list had vanished.\nThe administration revised the list before its removal, reducing the number of targeted properties to 320. Among the initial list issued by the General Services Administration were 83 locations in Maryland; the revised list had 21 Maryland properties.\nThe U.S. Census Bureau headquarters in Suitland, the Social Security Administration buildings in Woodlawn, several buildings for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services in Woodlawn, several buildings for the Department of Energy in Germantown, and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration buildings in Silver Spring were among the targeted facilities.\nThe GSA said in a statement that “the list will be republished in the near future after we reevaluate this initial input and determine how we can make it easier for stakeholders to understand the nuances of the assets listed.”\nThe now-you-see-it, now-you-don’t listings drew fire from lawmakers, including Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Maryland.\n“While no one is opposed to bringing greater efficiency to our government, the Trump-Musk administration’s proposed indiscriminate sell-off of hundreds of facilities – walked back only hours later – is yet another example of chaos and confusion spread through their reckless assault on important public services and the federal workers who provide them,” Van Hollen said in a statement.\nRep. Steny Hoyer, D-Maryland, said that “it should come as no shock that the GSAs rollout of an arbitrary and unnecessary list of ‘non-core assets’ was as sloppy and unserious as the rest of the Trump administrations actions.”\n“The federal government doesnt lease these facilities; it owns them,” he said. “The administration’s list included numerous essential buildings that agencies use every day to provide vital services to the American people.”\nRep. Sarah Elfreth, D-Maryland, said in a statement that “while I believe there is ample room to discuss an effective and efficient way to structure government and government buildings to best serve the American people, the Trump administration has shown no interest in doing that.”\n“They are once again taking a sledgehammer – not a scalpel – to the services that millions of Americans rely on” Elfreth said. “GSA pulling down the list of buildings they plan to dispose of this morning further demonstrates their lack of planning or forethought.”\nGSA’s Public Buildings Service, in a statement on Tuesday, said the federal office properties would be sold because they were “empty and underutilized” and “functionally obsolete and unsuitable for use by our federal workforce” as a result of underfunding. Properties that PBS identified as necessary and critical for the government’s operation were courthouses, ports of entry and facilities for national defense and law enforcement.\nGSA said on Wednesday in a statement said: To be clear, just because an asset is on the list doesnt mean its immediately for sale. However, we will consider compelling offersand do whats best for the needs of the federal government and taxpayer.\nRep. Mike Ezell, R-Mississippi, and chairman of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee’s economic development, public buildings and emergency management subcommittee, noted at a Wednesday hearing that a report by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that the majority of federal agencies used 25% or less of their headquarters building spaces. Some agencies reported a utilization rate close to 9%.\nEzell said that the federal government spends $2 billion a year to maintain and operate office buildings regardless of whether the buildings are unoccupied.\nArizona Rep. Greg Stanton, the ranking Democrat on the subcommittee, said that there is a more efficient way to go about disposing of federal office properties, but the Trump administration isn’t following proper procedures.\n“There has been mass confusion,” Stanton said. “Landlords are getting termination letters that their tenants know nothing about. Parties in the middle of lease negotiations don’t know what to do.”\nHe added: “These space disposals are happening at the same time President Trump has mandated the return to work for all federal employees. This appears to be a policy at war with itself.”\nThe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services are among agencies that said they knew nothing of the proposed sales, as CMS “did not submit or approve any of our current office locations being on this list,” according to an X post."

    "title": "Lawmakers, environmental groups say Trump freezes threaten local water quality",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  President Donald Trump’s spending freezes and grants cuts are hurting efforts to improve local water quality in the Chesapeake Bay region, lawmakers and environmental groups said Wednesday.\n“The pause in federal funding for clean water projects is putting community partners, like farmers, small businesses and localities, in dire financial situations,” Kristin Reilly, director of the Choose Clean Water Coalition, said in a statement.\nFor the thirteenth year in a row, the Choose Clean Water Coalition hosted its “Chesapeake Bay Day on Capitol Hill” to advocate for current and future funding for a network of over 300 nonprofit organizations.\nAdvocates with the coalition met with congressional staff and lawmakers amidst continuing uncertainty over current federal spending under program cuts and cancellations ordered by the Trump administration and carried out by billionaire Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).\nA deeply divided Congress also is wrestling with a March 15 deadline to keep the government running and remains far from hard negotiations on longer-term spending.\nCoalition members requested over $92 million in funding to work on projects that they said would stimulate local economies, improve the health of communities and safeguard natural resources. Reilly said that the money appropriated for the current fiscal year already has been allocated, but because of the freeze, it is not flowing to coalition recipients.\nThe funds are distributed as reimbursements, coalition officials said. A lot of organizations already have done their work or bought the materials needed to do their work, but they are now waiting to be reimbursed. Without the money, the work has come to a halt.\n“The vitality of the (Chesapeake) Bay is essential to economic success,” Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Maryland, said. “If the Chesapeake Bay died, so would lots of businesses  businesses that make their living off the bounty of the Bay.”\nThat includes oystermen, fisheries, recreation and tourism, Van Hollen said.\nBryan Hofmann, deputy director of the Friends of the Rappahannock, one of the numerous nonprofits in the coalition, expressed his frustration about not knowing if or when the funding freeze will thaw. He said that the federal money his organization receives would go straight to “on-the-ground” efforts to clean and protect the Chesapeake Bay watershed.\n“There was a comment made by the administration yesterday  they intended to cut the workforce and cut the budget by 65%,” Sen. Angela Alsobrooks, D-Maryland, said. “I think it’s going to make it extraordinarily difficult for us to continue the work that we’re doing…Those are the kinds of cuts and freezes that make no sense whatsoever and have a negative economic impact on our state and other states.”\nRep. Rob Wittman, R-Virginia, a staunch supporter of the Choose Clean Water Coalition, emphasized the importance of bipartisan support.\n“The Bay is a national treasure; it has value to everybody,” Wittman said. “We have to do more to improve water quality. We understand the value of the resources in the Bay; that’s something that’s universal.”\n“We have always enjoyed bipartisan support,” Reilly said. “It’s really because the members of Congress see the amazing things that are happening with the funding. We’re able to take them out into their districts to see the pollution reduction projects, the habitat that’s been created for fish and wildlife…And I think that is something that they can understand, and they see the benefits.”"

    "title": "Maryland lawmakers, unions denounce continued Trump firings of federal workers",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  Braving pouring rain, federal employees, union leaders, and lawmakers rallied on Capitol Hill on Wednesday to protest what they called a growing threat to the merit-based civil service as the Trump administration pushes efforts to weaken job protections.\nAs the crowd chanted “Let us work” in unison, protesters held up signs reading “Solidarity” over an American flag, “Department of Government Evil” with a giant red ‘X,’ and “We worked. He golfed.”\n“Neither rain, nor snow, or (the) dead of night will keep us from our rounds,” Rep. Steny Hoyer, D-Maryland, told a Capitol Hill rally with other lawmakers and union officials. “That’s what every employee says every morning as they get up and go to work.”\nBut President Donald Trump’s director of the Office of Management and Budget, Russell Vought, has said he wants to traumatize federal workers, Hoyer said.\n“Ladies and gentlemen, you and I both know something, that what they’re doing is not legal, not constitutional,” he said.\nWASHINGTON  A protest sign is wedged in a bicycle rack at a Capitol Hill rally Wednesday by federal workers targeted for firing by the Trump administration. (Jade Tran/Capital News Service)\nWith layoffs underway across numerous federal agencies and Republican support for job cuts gaining traction, federal workers say they are bracing for uncertainty — fearful their jobs could be politicized or eliminated entirely. For many, the fight is not just about policy but about protecting the work they have dedicated their lives to in service to the American people.\nA longtime Internal Revenue Service (IRS) employee who attended the rally described her job as something she loved dearly — one she took an oath to uphold in good service to the country.\nShe told Capital News Service that the recent layoffs and buyouts, which she described as “early resignations,” an assault on federal workers. Despite public misconceptions, she said, those being laid off are not idle or unproductive at home and should never be labeled as slackers. She asked for anonymity so she could speak frankly.\n“We do a vital job  we collect 97% of the federal budget that pays for the United States,” she said. “We need protection for what’s happening to us. We work hard; we don’t just eat bonbons and watch TV.”\nShe said the layoffs and terminations are being framed as a purge of underperforming employees, but she believes that is not the case.\n“There are single mothers, single fathers — fired in two days with no notice whatsoever,” she said. “It might not hurt you right now, but it will later, and you will feel it.”\n\nWith a megaphone in hand and rain pouring down, Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Maryland, described listening to Trump’s address to a joint session of Congress Tuesday night as an “avalanche of lies.” He said the falsehoods became so overwhelming that he had to walk out. He assured the rally crowd that he planned to fight the administration in communities all over the country.\n“We’re not going to let the rain stop us from shutting down the Elon Musk operation, are we?” he asked, prompting a resounding “No!” from the crowd. “Hell no!” he shouted back.\nA probationary worker laid off on Feb. 20 described to CNS his time at Baltimore’s IRS office as an incredibly wonderful experience. Like his colleagues, he emphasized the irony of firing people under the premise of bad performance, adding that individual ratings were never reviewed before cuts were made.\n“If they’re trying to make improvements in the federal offices, it’s better to look at everyone’s performance first,” he said the employee, who also asked for anonymity. “We have performance reports every six months, with supervisor check-ins every month, having us provide a report of what we’ve done.”\nReflecting on the process, he added: “How will they look at people now if they’re looking at federal workers this way?”\nAs a person of color, he said his greatest fear was not just losing his job but existing as a person in this country beyond his job. Another laid-off worker from the same location recognized him mid-conversation and stopped to offer his condolences.\n“If you’re an old-timer, think about retirement. If you’re in between, stay strong and hope for the best,” the fellow IRS worker said. “Keep a good attitude  because this too shall pass.”\nThe Capitol Hill rally was hosted by the National Treasury Employees Union (NTEU) with participation from the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) and other labor groups.\n“It’s not so cold, but it’s not so pleasant,” Hoyer said as the rain soaked the rally. “But it’s much more unpleasant what is being done to our federal employees. It is much more unpleasant the services that will not be done.”"

    "title": "Sudden firings by Trump administration rock key climate and weather agency",
    "content": "SILVER SPRING, Md.  Early Friday, a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration headquarters employee rushed through the hallway, going about his usual work.\nHe paused briefly to exchange contact information, offering to connect reporters with former colleagues fired the day before. Less than an hour later, he was fired, and his computer was confiscated.\nHundreds of employees met the same fate Thursday and Friday after the Trump administration abruptly fired them.\nWorkers scrambled to empty their workspaces and remove personal belongings after receiving termination letters via email.\nThe Commerce Department, parent agency of NOAA, gave fired employees less than two hours to pack up, turn in their badges and computers and exit the office by 5 p.m., according to a former NOAA employee who spoke to Capital News Service on the condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal.\nThe email sent to probationary employees stated that they were in a probationary period and that their appointments were not final until that period ended.\n“The agency finds that you are not fit for continued employment because your ability, knowledge and/or skills do not fit the agency’s current needs,” said the termination letter obtained by CNS.\nA fired probationary employee, a marine biologist who spent eight years with the National Marine Fisheries Service at NOAA, said she received her termination notice while performing daily tasks.\n“I was literally in the middle of work when I got the email. I had to immediately stop it (my work). Save it. Back it up. I went into chaos mode,” she said.\nShe said working at NOAA fulfilled a childhood dream that took years of hard work and decades of education to achieve. As a child, she fell in love with sharks and octopuses swimming in the blue sea, inspiring her to become a marine biologist to preserve species and conserve habitats for future generations.\nSILVER SPRING, Md.  The entrance to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration headquarters here saw fired employees leaving the agency on Friday, the latest casualties in the Trump administrations efforts to purge the federal workforce. (Tolu Talabi/Capital News Service)\n“The hand, you know, where we were just standing,” a current NOAA employee of six years said, referring to the sculpture of a hand outside of the agency’s headquarters. “The hand of NOAA reaches from the bottom of the oceans to the top of the sky.”\nA federal judge on Thursday ruled that terminating probationary federal workers may be illegal and then ordered the Office of Personnel Management to reverse directives for the mass firings of the workers.\nLast week, the Office of Personnel Management asked NOAA leadership to write up a justification letter for why employees identified as probationary should be allowed to keep their jobs, a current NOAA employee told CNS.\nA current NOAA employee described the atmosphere as unprofessional.\nHaving spent a third of his career in the private sector, he said the way these layoffs were handled would never have been tolerated before. He added that in recent days, supervisors had been “blindsided,” with employees learning of their terminations from third parties  without their supervisors’ knowledge.\nSpeaking about a high-level financial analyst recently laid off within his office, he described her work ethic and professionalism as rare and irreplaceable. But he emphasized that employees should not be categorized or treated as disposable in the first place.\n“It’s not an exaggeration to say that this loss will put lives at risk,” the source said to CNS. “It’s not just in the weather business, it also has a huge role in the seafood industry and the livelihood to be able to sell products overseas.”\nDr. Rick Spinrad, former under secretary of commerce for oceans and atmosphere and former NOAA administrator, stressed the critical role the agency plays during a press conference hosted by Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Maryland.\nSpinrad said more than 600 of his colleagues were fired Thursday and added that the full impact would be hard to quantify. With tornado season approaching, along with winter storms, floods and droughts, he said the agency needs more highly qualified employees, not fewer.\nSpinrad said NOAA employees maintain Global Positioning System (GPS) satellites and provide weather data that is used to predict flight delays and cancellations.\nVan Hollen said he’s working with Montgomery County, specifically Silver Spring, to talk about opportunities to provide laid off federal workers with jobs.\nCraig McLean, a former captain on NOAA research ships and the agency’s former assistant administrator for research, said in the press call that the Department of Efficiency (DOGE) is planning to relocate NOAA headquarters as a tactic to get rid of employees.\nVan Hollen added under Project 2025, many federal agencies are set to be relocated.\n“The Trump administration’s illegal actions to slash NOAA’s workforce – indiscriminately and without cause – will only hurt vital services that Americans depend on. As I made clear to Commerce Secretary (Howard) Lutnick yesterday: this action is flatly illegal,” Van Hollen said in a statement.\nNumerous meteorologists took to social media to denounce the firings, many in the National Weather Service.\n“NWS has fired meteorologists as a direct result of upper-level heads telling them to do so,” Ethan Clark, a meteorologist for the city of Raleigh, North Carolina, posted on X. “Let me be clear, people will die because of this. Absolutely insane. I have no words for it.”\nOcean Conservancy Vice President Jeff Watters said in a statement: “The indiscriminate firing of employees is going to sabotage NOAA’s ability to do essential work that every single American relies on.”\n“NOAA is the eyes and ears for our water and air – the agency tracks our weather and climate; monitors tides and surf forecasts; allows for the safe deployment and navigation of satellites, ships, and doppler radar,” he said. “It acts as a first responder with its weather and hurricane emergency alerts; its tsunami warning centers; its oil spill response capabilities; its marine mammal stranding network; and its harmful algal blooms early warning systems. NOAA even keeps seafood on the table. Americans depend on NOAA each and every day, and so does the health of the ocean.”"

    "title": "Fired federal workers descend on Senate to put human faces on Trump-Musk cuts",
    "content": "WASHINGTON—Nearly 40 recently terminated federal workers walked from Senate office to Senate office Tuesday, hoping to share their stories with senators and their staffs.\nThe visits were promoted through various channels, including a Signal group for terminated federal employees and the Fork Off Coalition, a grassroots group of current and former federal workers protesting the Trump administration’s recent firings of federal employees.\nAlmost 30,000 federal employees across the country have been fired since billionaire Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency began its work in late January, according to an analysis by Bloomberg Law.\n“I’m hoping that we can shed light on what federal government workers accomplish and reverse course before it’s too late and all these departments really crumble,” said a 28-year-old Washington resident who asked not to be identified. She was a visual information specialist at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention before she was fired on Feb. 15.\nIn the late afternoon, Maryland Democratic lawmakers met with federal union leaders in the United States Capitol to denounce the Trump-Musk firings and program cuts.\nRep. Kweisi Mfume held a sign renaming DOGE as the “Department of Government Evil.”\n“The simple message is leave federal workers alone. Period,” Mfume said. “This notion of Elon Musk ticks all of us off, but we can’t get so upset by it that we miss the fact that we have to organize our people in the street. They’ve got to know that there is real hope.”\nSen. Chris Van Hollen charged that DOGE’s actions are not about government efficiency.\n“All of us agree that we can find ways to make the government more efficient in a targeted, surgical way,” he said. “What this has been about is taking over key government agencies to rig them in a way that they do the bidding of people like Elon Musk…and try to hack away services that benefit all Americans.”\nRep. Sarah Elfreth, in a statement to Capital News Service, cited the high volume of calls and emails she’s received from her constituents.\n“Since DOGE — led by unappointed and unelected billionaire Elon Musk — began taking a sledgehammer to the federal government, I have heard from and met with many concerned civil servants in the Third District,” Elfreth said. “It is clear from my conversations that President Musk and DOGE have no strategy or plan besides stoking chaos and demoralizing government workers.”\nEverett Kelley, national president of the American Federation of Government Employees, told CNS: I think this department is a facade.\nI think that its just a way that the president is paying back his buddiesand its at the expense of the federal workforce, Kelley said.\nThey are threatening the federal workforce and its all to try to get them to quit, so that the federal government goes into a mission failure, he said. If the federal employees are not there, then they can easily contract out that work.\nSeveral of the fired federal workers shared their experiences with CNS. Here are some of their stories:\nThe ex-CDC worker said she had worked remotely for the agency since 2019, but she took on a new role five months ago, making her vulnerable to ongoing federal probationary firings. A Washington resident, she is now among thousands of probationary workers laid off across federal agencies.\n“I knew it was coming. I knew that once it was official, I would start crying,” she told CNS. “But when I saw the letter, I was actually very mad. I have never been more incensed in my life because of the content of the letter.”\nShe said the letter, which included nearly identical language from termination letters across the federal government, cited inadequate performance and deemed her unfit for employment—claims she found shocking and easy to disprove.\nA Wisconsin native, she has always been passionate about infectious diseases and had dreamed of working at the CDC since discovering its booth at a college job fair. She said that the apparent job security in the federal government was just a bonus for her.\nShe plans to join a class-action lawsuit appealing to the U.S. Merit Systems Protection Board, arguing that the proper reduction-in-force procedures were not followed.\nWASHINGTON  Elizabeth Glidden, a former technical program officer for the Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance, part of the U.S.Agency for International Development (USAID), was among federal workers trying to talk to senators and their staffs Tuesday in the Hart Senate Office Building. (Giuseppe LoPiccolo/Capital News Service)\nPeter Kerndt, 72, was a physician for the U.S. Agency for International Development Global Health Bureau before he received a work termination email on Jan. 28. A California resident, he had worked remotely since October 2020, specializing in the Infectious Disease Tuberculosis Division in Washington.\n“I am going to do fine,” Kerndt said about his termination. “That’s why I have to be here…to support (other federal workers) and I think that’s what we need—to stay together.”\nWASHINGTON  Peter Kerndt was fired on Jan. 28 from his job as a physician with USAIDs Global Health Bureau. (Daranee Balachandar/Capital News Service)\nKerndt shared his concern for those his team served in countries like Mozambique, Tanzania and the Philippines, where DOGE earlier this month cut aid to combat for diseases like tuberculosis, malaria and HIV.\n“It started with USAID, but it’s not stopping here,” Kerndt said. “You don’t go about making a bureaucracy work better by destroying it.”\nBrandon Bradley, a 23-year-old Washington resident, worked as a government affairs specialist at the National Science Foundation before being laid off.\nOn Feb. 15, Bradley said he was called into a meeting with human resources—without his supervisors’ knowledge—and was told he was being terminated, needed to transfer his work to someone else and would be dismissed by 5 p.m.\nBradley, who started at NSF in October, was vulnerable to a probationary termination. He asserted that the agency made it clear he and his colleagues were not fired based on performance or conduct, but that it came as a surprise since leadership had assured him in late January that he would not be fired.\n“I love this job, and so to be told thats no longer the case with an hours notice, I was heartbroken,” Bradley said. “It didn’t really hit me until the rest of the week that I had nowhere to go.”\nA Texas native, Bradley moved to Washington in 2022 to work for Rep. Jasmine Crockett, D-Texas, while pursuing a masters degree from the University of Texas at Austin.\nWASHINGTON  Brandon Bradley was fired on Feb. 15. He was a government affairs specialist at the National Science Foundation. (Colin McNamara/Capital News Service)\nBorn with a visual disability, Bradley knew he couldn’t complete military basic training like his parents and older brothers, all Navy veterans. Instead, he pursued public service in another way, working for the U.S. government, the Texas House of Representatives and as a substitute middle school science teacher.\n“If you just try and hollow out the federal government, you are going to hollow out communities across this country,” Bradley said. “So much of what folks are doing across the country, especially in rural communities, is reliant on federal workers administering government programs, and that needs to be understood.”\nAriella Bock, a former senior supply chain advisor specializing in HIV, was terminated from the U.S. Agency of International Development shortly after the new administration took office.\n“I think it’s important for people to see the faces of federal workers, and also understand the diversity and the impact of the current situation,” Bock said. “It’s not just about me as an individual.”\nBock, a Washington resident, joined Tuesday’s gathering in hopes of sharing her story—as well as her resume. Throughout the morning, the group visited several senators’ offices, including Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-South Dakota.\n“We haven’t spoken to any senators at this point, some of them have had staff and seem sympathetic,” Bock said. “Some of them aren’t giving us the time of day and kick us out of the space. They currently seem to be working, I think, for themselves.”\nAllie Mitchell is a former clinical trials specialist in Alzheimer’s research at the National Institute on Aging, part of the National Institutes of Health. She said she relocated from Florida to Washington for her role in September, and received her termination letter on Feb. 15.\nShe stepped out on Tuesday in search of her next professional opportunity, she said.\n“I thought it would be more sitting in offices today and applying to jobs together,” Mitchell said. “I brought my computer, my resume—in case anybody here works in public health.”\nMitchell also said that being around others is helping her cope with her firing.\n“I’m here because I’m really sad, and I don’t want to be at home and be sad,” she said. “I’d rather be around other people.”"

    "title": "Van Hollen calls GOP budget plan, Trump cuts &#8216;betrayal&#8217;",
    "content": "WASHINGTON – Maryland Democratic Sen. Chris Van Hollen on Wednesday criticized a Republican budget bill endorsed by President Donald Trump, which provides tax breaks to the wealthy that are partially offset by huge cuts to Medicaid.\nVan Hollen also blasted billionaire Elon Musk’s efforts to dismantle certain federal agencies and fire large numbers of federal workers.\n“It is the great betrayal,” Van Hollen said in remarks on the Senate floor. “Because the reason we’re seeing these efforts to slash important public investments across the board and cut important positions in federal agencies is because they want to make room for a big tax cut for wealthy people.”\nThe GOP bill unveiled in the House includes $4.5 trillion in tax cuts to the wealthy. At the same time, the proposed budget would slash funding for numerous domestic programs like Medicaid, which Van Hollen said he hopes to safeguard in a proposed amendment to the bill. During a Senate Budget Committee meeting last week, he tried unsuccessfully to pass a similar amendment.\n“If there’s abuse going on in the Medicare and Medicaid programs, absolutely  go for it,” the senator said. “But that’s not what we’re talking about here. We said: ‘Don’t cut benefits to the American people.’”\n“Medicaid is a very important health program. It benefits hundreds of thousands, if not close to a million, Marylanders,” Van Hollen later told Capital News Service.\nVan Hollen said that while during the campaign Trump disavowed any knowledge of the far-right Project 2025 agenda, he is now implementing it.\nWith a Republican majority in the House, Trump claimed in a Truth Social post Wednesday that the budget resolution, split into two bills, will “implement (his) FULL America First Agenda, EVERYTHING, not just parts of it.”\nVan Hollen earlier Wednesday spoke at a rally against cuts to the Department of Health and Human Services, particularly in the National Institutes of Health, where numerous employees have been fired. The NIH is headquartered in Maryland."

    "title": "Maryland Democrats appalled by Trump&#8217;s Ukraine stance",
    "content": "WASHINGTON— Some of Maryland’s Democratic lawmakers say they are appalled by President Donald Trump’s comments blaming Ukraine for Russia’s invasion and calling Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky a dictator.\n“He called President Zelensky a dictator when it’s Vladamir Putin that is the dictator and wants the assault on the Ukrainian people,” Sen. Chris Van Hollen said Wednesday on the Senate floor. “We should all be ashamed, ashamed, Mr. President.”\nSen. Angela Alsobrooks said in a statement to Capital News Service that “it’s an asinine comment that makes it clear this President is more interested in helping Putin than standing up for our allies.”\nRep. Jamie Raskin posted on X: “President Trump calls Zelensky a ‘dictator,’ which can’t be true because Trump loves all the dictators. That’s why he appeases  coddles Putin  his filthy imperialist war on the people of Ukraine. History teaches us that we bow down to dictators  tyrants at our own peril.”\nThe feud between Trump and Zelensky started on Tuesday, as senior officials from the United States and Russia met in Saudi Arabia to discuss ending the Ukraine war and re-establishing normal relations. It was the two countries’ most extensive talks since 2022 — when Russia invaded Ukraine — and notably excluded Ukraine and Zelensky.\nZelensky angrily responded to Tuesday’s meeting, saying he was postponing his planned visit to Saudi Arabia — which was scheduled for Wednesday — in protest. Trump said he was disappointed by Ukraine’s reaction, then blamed the country for starting the war and claiming it “could have made a deal.”\nTensions continued to rise Wednesday, when Zelensky said Trump lives in a “web of disinformation” influenced by Russia, which sparked an intense post on Trump’s Truth Social account calling Zelensky a “dictator without elections.”\nIt is now obvious why Zelenskyy was not included in the discussions so critical to the future of Ukraine,” Rep. Steny Hoyer said in a statement Wednesday. “President Trump is clearly adopting Putin’s argument, which has been rejected by the free world and the United States of America in a bipartisan fashion. Every American and every Republican and Democrat who loves freedom and opposes dictators and war criminals should be speaking out forcefully in opposition to this Putin lie that, shockingly, Trump has parroted. His relationship with this despot is dangerous and despicable.\nRep. April McClain Delaney agreed with Hoyer’s statement, saying in an X post Thursday that Trump’s comments are insulting to soldiers and civilians who have lost their lives in the war.\n“We must continue to stand with NATO and democracies across the globe,” she said.\nTrump also claimed the United States provided Ukraine with $350 billion worth of aid and that Zelensky admitted half of the money sent went missing. In fact, the United States has allocated $119 billion in aid, according to the Kiel Institute, a research organization in Germany, the New York Times reported.\n“While I agree with the President that our NATO allies can and should invest more in the security of Europe, I was astonished and disappointed to see the President siding with an adversary and dictator, Vladimir Putin, while repeating Russian propaganda and falsely calling an American ally, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, a dictator,” Rep. Sarah Elfreth said in a statement to CNS.\n“The White House’s statements and actions this week only serve to undermine the independence of Ukraine and destabilize the 76-year alliance with our European friends,” she added.\nSome Republicans also voiced their disagreement with Trumps remarks.\nSen. Roger Wicker, R-Mississippi, told CNN that “any sort of peace talks that might get a fair result would definitely need to have the Ukrainians at the table and make sure that European interests are considered and carefully weighed.”\nThe chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Wicker added that Putin could not be trusted in any negotiations.\n“Putin is a war criminal and should be in jail for the rest of his life  if not executed,” the senator said.\nReturning from an official visit to Ukraine earlier this week, Sen. Thom Tillis, R-North Carolina, commended Zelensky for fighting against Russia, NPR reported.\n“(Putin’s) a very bad person who needs to be stopped. Hes going to metastasize across Europe if we dont (stop him),” Tillis said. The senator added that he would give the president the benefit of the doubt in negotiating peace talks between Russia and Ukraine.\nSenate Majority Leader John Thune, R-South Dakota, told reporters in the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday that he believed the president and his administration are working to achieve a peaceful outcome for the war in Ukraine.\nRep. Andy Harris, the only Republican in the Maryland congressional delegation, declined to comment on Trump’s Ukraine statements.\nMaryland Reps. Kweisi Mfume and Glenn Ivey did not provide comments for this story.\nMaryland is home to a large Ukrainian community, particularly in the Baltimore area.\nCNS Washington reporters Jade Tran and Jess Daninhirsch contributed to this story."

    "title": "Maryland constituents voice worries about Trump actions during senators’ call-in",
    "content": "WASHINGTON – Constituents from across Maryland gathered for a virtual town hall Wednesday to voice concerns to Democratic Sens. Chris Van Hollen and Angela Alsobrooks about the Trump administration’s efforts to dismantle federal agencies and the potential impact on their jobs and the state’s economy.\nAmid efforts by billionaire Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), created by President Donald Trump on Jan. 20, to shut down some agencies, cut federal jobs, and slash agency leases, Van Hollen, Alsobrooks and Robert Shriver of Democracy Forward, a legal organization that promotes democracy and social progress, addressed public concerns over Social Security, buyouts, proposed cuts to public health and disability, and other issues.\nI am troubled about the imminent effort to slash the number of people who work to protect our nations public health implement our biomedical research agenda and protect kids from tobacco products, said Erica (callers’ last names were not made public) from Chevy Chase, Maryland, a mother of two teenage boys, a wife, and a public health advocate.\n“These cuts are devastating, and they will quite literally cost lives, to NIH (the National Institutes of Health), to researchers and scientists who have been working on cures to important, to devastating diseases. It will literally cost lives,” Alsobrooks responded.\nAbout 17,000 people were on the tele-town hall, according to Van Hollen’s office.\nVan Hollen told callers that he has been closely tracking what he called the illegal, unilateral cuts to medical agencies like the NIH and the potential harm to ongoing research efforts focused on diseases like cancer and Alzheimer’s.\nHe noted that he joined other lawmakers in a lawsuit challenging the Trump administration’s cuts. Johns Hopkins University and 12 other universities have filed a similar lawsuit.\nAnother caller named Erica, from Oxon Hill, Maryland, was a federal worker whose job focused on environmental justice.\n“I was put on administrative leave and it’s heartbreaking,” Erica said. “I feel like my leg’s been cut off.”\nShe said she was worried about whether federal employees should take layoff options, including buyouts, after being placed on administrative leave.\nErica was one of several employees in her group placed on administrative leave who hoped to bring attention to their plight through a complaint to the U.S. Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) for wrongful termination.\nHowever, Van Hollen said that the Trump administration has also targeted the MSPB, recently firing members of the board without cause. Despite this, he urged federal workers in similar situations to remember that administrative judges within the MSPB will remain in place and will continue to hear cases, even if the board itself is later dissolved.\nFran from Silver Spring, another caller, asked whether Democratic members of Congress planned to sue the president for violating the Impoundment Control Act of 1974, which allows Congress to check the executive’s withholding of budgeted funds.\n“The Impoundment Act of 1974 is valid all the way up to the Supreme Court. So why aren’t members of Congress directly suing over the withholding of funds from all of these agencies?” Fran asked.\nVan Hollen responded that one of the first phone calls he made was regarding the violation of the act, adding that Congress does not have the authority to take direct legal action. However, he has reached out to the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) by letter, urging an investigation into the violation.\n“Many of these lawsuits have been the violation of the Impoundment Control Act because, as you just said, the Supreme Court has previously ruled that presidents cant cherry-pick the law, Van Hollen said.\nRosemary, 69, from Baltimore County, called in on behalf of herself and her sister, both of whom rely heavily on Social Security. Rosemary said her main concern was Musk’s access to Treasury Department data.\n“Not only Elon but people who work with him—they have access to our Social Security numbers…You know, this is our lifeline,” Rosemary said.\nAccording to Van Hollen, Trump and Musk’s push to dismantle federal agencies is part of a covert plan tied to Project 2025, a collection of far-right proposals that began circulating years before the 2024 election as a presumed blueprint for Trump’s second term.\nDespite growing media attention and repeated questions from reporters throughout his campaign, Trump denied any knowledge of the plan. Van Hollen claims Musk is now working to implement it.\nVan Hollen criticized Musk, arguing that a department claiming to be efficient is acting counterproductively.\n“But if you want to make the government more efficient, you don’t start by firing en masse all the inspectors general, as President Trump did,” Van Hollen said. “Inspectors general are the independent watchdogs.”\nBoth senators, along with Shriver, ended the call with words of encouragement, urging constituents to contact Republican lawmakers’ offices to let them know what is happening.\n“For them to really understand the magnitude in the breadth of people who are impacted by these decisions, the Republicans have to hear from all of you,” Alsobrooks said."

    "title": "Lawmakers spar over Trump-Musk efforts to dissolve USAID",
    "content": "WASHINGTON – Maryland Rep. Johnny Olszewski and his Democratic colleagues at a House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing Thursday condemned the Trump administration for attempting to dissolve the U.S. Agency for International Development.\n“I think there is a well-established process that does not include wholesale elimination or pausing of funding,” Olszewski said. \nThere were several programs under the agency that should be investigated and might merit defunding, he said, but he reiterated that there was a legal process to follow in doing so that would not affect federal employees.\n“By freezing funding without congressional intervention, the president has gone against both Article I (of the Constitution), which gives Congress the power of the purse, as well as the Impoundment Act of 1974,” Olszewski later told Capital News Service.\nThe Impoundment Act requires the president to give notice to and receive approval from Congress to not spend legally appropriated funds, Olszewski said.\nThe chairman of the foreign affairs panel, Rep. Brian Mast, R-Florida, vilified USAID, an agency created by President John F. Kennedy.\n“Many of the people and many of the programs in USAID have literally betrayed America,” Mast charged. “America would have been better off if your money had been thrown into the fireplace.”\nUSAID administers humanitarian aid programs and offers development assistance internationally.\n\n@cnsmaryland Capital News Service was there as a worker placed black tape over the name of the U.S. Agency for International Development outside of the agencys headquarters near the White House earlier today. The woman told reporters she was unaffiliated with the agency. Today, following days of protests over the dismantling of the agency, President Donald Trump called for USAID, the world’s largest provider of humanitarian aid, to be shut down. #usaid ♬ original sound  Capital News Service\n\n\nThe administration attempted to place over 2,000 USAID workers on administrative leave, but a Trump-appointed federal judge issued a temporary restraining order to block the move, and on Thursday extended the hold until Feb 21. \nA group of current and former USAID employees filed a lawsuit in Baltimore federal court against Elon Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency Thursday to stop the dismantling of the agency. \nOlszewski also addressed the Feb. 11 firing of the agency’s former Inspector General, Paul K. Martin, during the committee hearing. According to an email obtained by The Washington Post, Martin was notified by the White House that his position at USAID was “terminated, effectively immediately.” \n“Inspector general firings, the president must provide Congress 30-day notice and ‘substantive rationale’ including detailed and case-specific reasons for the firing and to my knowledge that has not taken place,” Olszewski said. \nRepresentatives from the Trump administration were not present at the panel hearing."

    "title": "Maryland officials denounce Trump efforts to dismantle federal civil service",
    "content": "WASHINGTON—Maryland Sens. Chris Van Hollen and Angela Alsobrooks joined other members of the state’s congressional delegation and federal employee unions near the U.S. Capitol Tuesday to denounce the Trump administration’s efforts to dismantle the federal civil service.\n“The really callous, heartless, horrible witch hunt that is occurring right now against our civil servants is not just an attack on you—its an attack on the American people,” Alsobrooks told the hundreds of federal workers protesting at the rally.\nThe American Federation of Government Employees, the largest union for federal employees in the country, hosted the “Rally to Save Civil Service” as part of its annual legislative conference.\n“This has nothing to do with making the government more efficient,” Van Hollen said at the event. “This is the most corrupt bargain in American history—Elon Musk spent over $280 million to elect Donald Trump, and Donald Trump hands Elon Musk the keys to federal agencies.”\nTrump created the White House’s Department of Government Efficiency on Jan. 20, appointing billionaire Elon Musk to lead the agency, which aims to cut federal spending. The temporary department, set to shut down on July 4, 2026, has since offered federal employees resignation packages known as a “Fork in the Road,” ordered the closure of the U.S. Agency for International Development and canceled diversity, equity and inclusion contracts across the federal government.\n“Were at a fork in the road, and we need to take the fork that says, ‘Shut down the Elon Musk illegal operation,’” Van Hollen said.\nThe senators were joined by fellow Maryland Democrats, Reps. Steny Hoyer, April McClain-Delaney and Sarah Elfreth, who also condemned Trump and Musk’s “illegal” attempts to politicize and privatize the federal workforce. They urged Republican lawmakers to join Democrats in upholding the Constitution in the Senate and the House.\n“We are sponsoring and co-sponsoring so many bills, but we cannot move unless three of our colleagues come along with us,” McClain-Delaney said. “We need you to show up and say that you do not sign a loyalty oath to a president. You serve the American people and the Constitution.”\nHoyer warned against returning to a civil service “filled with political hacks who cared about their own interests.”\n“We talk up here and we send paper out…but frankly, we dont get the work done,” he said, addressing the federal workers. “We dont tend to the people in the hospital. We dont tend to the people who have a fire. We dont tend to people who (have) people breaking in their homes and they need us to come. You do that! You make a difference every day in the lives of every American.”.\nThe nearly two-hour rally featured 29 speakers, including House and Senate Democrats representing states across the country, many of whom used expletives to denounce Trump and Musk actions.\n“F— (expletive) Donald Trump and Elon Musk,” Rep. Mark Pocan, a Wisconsin Democrat, said. “The two words you should be hearing from your federal government are ‘Thank you’ … instead, they’re going around attacking you and the services that you’re providing.”\nThe AFGE has seen a historic surge in new membership since Trump’s anti-federal worker directives, reaching a record 321,000 paying members as of early February, the union said in a recent press release.\n“When your grandkids ask, ‘Where were you when billionaires and oligarchs tried to take America?’ You will say, ‘We were right here in the capital, taking it back, inch by inch, brick by brick,” AFGE Vice President Dr. Kendrick Roberson said.\nVan Hollen told Capital News Service that he encourages recently laid off federal employees  who make up nearly six percent of Maryland’s total employment, according to a 2024 report by the Maryland comptroller  to take legal action.\n“Were working with (federal employees and contractors) to try to make sure that we can make them whole and most importantly, put an end to this illegal takeover by Elon Musk,” Van Hollen said.\nCNS reporter Joey Barke contributed to this story."

    "title": "Democrats and protesters rally against Trump-Musk efforts to shut down USAID",
    "content": "WASHINGTON—Hundreds rallied near the U.S. Capitol Wednesday to defend the U.S. Agency for International Development as the Trump administration moves to dismantle the agency, marking the third day of protests.\n“It’s important to show that there are regular, everyday people who strongly support continuing foreign aid, and I would hope that there would be an acknowledgment that the actions against USAID are illegal,” said Laura Schauble, 48, a protester.\nProtesters were joined by House and Senate Democrats, many of whom criticized the administration’s actions as “illegal” and “unconstitutional.”\n“Getting rid of (USAID) makes us all less safe. It is also downright illegal,” Maryland Sen. Chris Van Hollen, a Democrat, said at the protest. “Presidents are not kings…the law is the law, and President Trump needs to obey all parts of that law.”\nLawmakers and protesters also condemned billionaire Elon Musk’s growing role in the federal government as head of the Department of Government Efficiency and a leading proponent of eradicating USAID, which he called on X a “criminal organization” that needs “to die.”\nWASHINGTON  Protesters on Wednesday rally in support of USAID, an international agency President Donald Trump and billionaire Elon Musk are trying to dismantle. (Cait Kelley/Capital News Service)\n“(Elon Musk) is trying to play dictator here in our nation’s capital, but he does not get to ignore the law. We need to shut down the Musk operation now,” Van Hollen said.\nUSAID, the world’s largest provider of humanitarian aid, assists nations in need with agricultural assistance, health programs, disaster relief and other development efforts, according to the Congressional Research Service. A Tuesday evening order mandated that all USAID staff cease operations and vacate posts worldwide by midnight Friday  the latest step in the administration’s abrupt dismantling of the government agency.\n“I think (USAID) is just an example of the kind of things that are good that ought to be kept in the federal budget,” retired federal employee and Maryland protester Richard Greely, 70, said.\nSchauble echoed this sentiment, calling USAID’s work a “cornerstone of our status in the world” and condemning the funding cuts as “counterproductive and asinine.”\nThree former USAID officials, Bama Athreya, Jeremy Konyndyk and Chris Milligan, also spoke at the demonstration, decrying the administration’s attack on the federal agency as a moral and constitutional failure that will lead to real harm.\n“We are in a country where the richest man can decide that the richest country will no longer help some of the poorest people. We are in a very, very dire place. The attempts to kill USAID will kill people that America has committed to save,” said Konyndyk, who served in top USAID posts in the Obama and Biden administrations and is now the president of Refugees International.\nThe speeches, featuring 22 speakers over an hour and a half, were repeatedly interrupted by chants from protesters: “Let them work,” “Do your job,” “What’s your plan” and “Musk has got to go.”\nHouse and Senate Democrats, the minority in both chambers, have staged protests across Washington all week. They demonstrated outside USAID headquarters Monday, the Treasury Department Tuesday and the Labor Department following Wednesday’s rally near the Capitol.\n“We will not shut up. We will stand up. We will speak up. We will rise up,” Sen. Cory Booker, D-New Jersey, said Wednesday near the Capitol. “From the House of Representatives to the United States Senate, we will be introducing legislation to stop this assault on our Constitution and separation of powers.”\nDespite the call to action from politicians, former USAID staffers and public health professionals, some protesters were doubtful the demonstration would sway the Trump administration.\n“I don’t expect (this protest) to get the attention of the current administration,” Schauble said. “But I would hope that it gets the attention of the American people.”"

    "title": "Musk targeting key weather forecasting and scientific research agency, Van Hollen says",
    "content": "WASHINGTON– Elon Musk’s staff has been at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) headquarters, according to Maryland Sen. Chris Van Hollen and former NOAA official Mary Glackin. \nIn an X post Tuesday night, Van Hollen said that billionaire Musk, recently appointed “special government employee” by the White House, has his sights set on NOAA.\n\nHearing reports that Musk’s cronies are targeting NOAA — infiltrating key systems  locking out career employees.\nNOAA is vital for weather forecasting, scientific research  more. Their critical work saves lives.\nMy team and I are looking into this  we will not stand for it.\n— Senator Chris Van Hollen (@ChrisVanHollen) February 5, 2025\n\n\nVan Hollen, a Democrat, said in a statement to Capital News Service: “Elon Musk’s lawless heist of our government should concern every American. Targeting NOAA as part of this unprecedented takeover will not improve government efficiency, instead, it will jeopardize critical work that saves lives.”\nAccording to Van Hollen’s office, Musk representatives have been at NOAA Building 2 in Silver Spring, Maryland. In addition, at least one individual associated with Musk visited the Department of Commerce in Washington, requested and was granted access to NOAA’s information technology systems to check on compliance with President Donald Trump’s executive order to end all diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs in the federal government, according to Van Hollen’s office.\nGlackin, who was deputy under secretary for operations at NOAA from 2007 until 2012 and a former president of the American Meteorological Society, said Musk’s team was in the agency’s headquarters Tuesday. She said she also noticed the agency’s websites had been shut down, she told CNS. She did not specify the timing of the changes to the websites.\nNOAA is a government agency under the Department of Commerce, and is headquartered in Silver Spring. The agency delivers daily weather forecasts and warnings, as well as monitors the climate through fisheries management, coastal restoration, and more to provide the public with information about the changing environment.\n“They are trying to vilify and force out talented, hardworking, and principled federal workers at NOAA who have devoted their careers to monitoring storms and other natural disasters that threaten communities across the country,” Rep. Steny Hoyer, D-Maryland, said in a statement provided to CNS.\nNOAA has about 12,000 employees, as reported by the agency on its website page updated two days ago. If Musk’s call to target the agency is successful, this could potentially impact a large number of federal employees, contributing to the growing wave of governmental job cuts.\nDr. Brad Colman, a former NOAA employee of 38 years, said that the NOAA is more than a domestic agency, and is very involved with international affairs, labeling the weather enterprise as the envy of the world. NOAA works with the public sector, private industry, and academia to form a solid synergy, Colman added. Colman said he is in communication with his former colleagues and current NOAA employees.\n“There’s a lot of nervousness and concern,” Colman said. “There’s just frustration that it seems like the details are being missed.”\nThe agency plays a critical role in saving lives, as Van Hollen stated in his X post. In 2024, NOAA’s work helped save 411 people from life-threatening situations, according to a press release from the U.S. Department of Commerce.\nRep. Jamie Raskin, D-Maryland, said on MSNBC that he sees “tell-tale signs of a coup,” in the recent actions of Musk, whose teams have gained access to the U.S. Agency for International Development, the Department of Labor, the Treasury Department and other federal agencies.\nTo Raskin, Musk has attempted to take over the country through the targeting of the communications, government, data and military infrastructure.\n“Elon Musk and Donald Trump are targeting NOAA for the same reason they’re targeting every other federal agency—they don’t want the government to function ‘For The People,’” Hoyer said.\nTrump nominated Neil Jacobs to lead NOAA just Tuesday. Jacobs, who used to lead the agency, was involved in the “Sharpiegate” incident in 2019, in which Trump falsely claimed that Hurricane Dorian would hit Alabama and drew the path on a map.\n“Elon Musk, he may get to be a dictator at Tesla, but he doesn’t get to be a dictator in Washington,” Van Hollen said in a video posted to X."

    "title": "Report finds unjustifiable grounds for picking Greenbelt as new FBI Headquarters",
    "content": "WASHINGTON—A federal inspector general found that a couple of the reasons cited for picking Greenbelt, Maryland, as the new FBI headquarters site were unjustified, according to a report released by the General Services Administration Monday.\nThe IG’s report stopped short of recommending a new site selection process, although Rep. Gerry Connolly, D-Virginia, charged that “GSA cooked the books.”\n“GSA provided inaccurate information to guide the site selection process and we may never know the full extent of missteps,” he said.\nMaryland officials, including Gov. Wes Moore, said in a joint statement that “nothing in this report disputes the GSA’s selection of Greenbelt as the future home of the FBI.”\nIt was unclear Tuesday whether the controversy will generate new efforts to contest the Greenbelt site.\nBased on five criteria, a three-member panel from the GSA and the FBI evaluated GSA-compiled data to choose from three sites: Springfield, Virginia; Greenbelt, Maryland; and Landover, Maryland.\nThe GSA announced it chose Greenbelt as the new site for the FBI headquarters campus, which is currently in downtown Washington, in November 2023. The site selection panel unanimously chose Springfield but senior GSA official Nina Albert overruled that decision.\nThe inspector general’s report said that the GSA overestimated relocation costs for the Springfield site and failed to provide specific equity data, such as racial and socioeconomic factors, for each location. Instead, the agency presented county-level data, which showed a greater need for support in Prince George’s County than in Fairfax County.\nThe report dismissed conflict-of-interest concerns over Albert, who previously served as the vice president of real estate and parking at Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority, which owns the Greenbelt site.\nThe GSA and its officials also failed to properly maintain text messages related to the relocation, according to the report. \nAlbert’s government-issued phone was cleared of all data by the GSA as part of an automatic off-boarding procedure for employees leaving the agency. Some officials created federal records by discussing the relocation on their personal cell phone, but failed to report these records until they were asked by the agency, months after the statutory deadline had passed.\nResponding to the IG’s report, then-GSA Administrator Robin Carnahan wrote in a letter dated six days before the end of the Biden administration that “while these findings are worth careful consideration, in my view none of them undermine the overall integrity of the process, the Site Selection Panel’s recommendation, or the Site Selection Authority’s (Albert’s) decision.” \nCarnahan added that “all those involved did their best to recommend and ultimately select a site that would provide the best value for the FBI and the public.”\nCNS did not receive responses from the GSA, Virginia Democratic Sens. Mark Warner and Tim Kaine or Fairfax County Supervisor Pat Herrity about possible next steps. \nThe FBIs press office wrote in an email that officials “don’t have any comment at this time.”\nGreenbelt Mayor Emmett V. Jordan told CNS that the city “remains the most cost-effective location for the FBI headquarters.” He also emphasized that Greenbelt adequately meets all the FBI’s security requirements and transportation accessibility needs.\nWith the site selection process already through many rounds of planning and vetting, Jordan said he hopes that “the GSA is able to move ahead to find a place, hopefully in Greenbelt, for the FBI,” especially with federal employees concerned about their jobs under the new administration.\nThe joint statement by Maryland officials, which besides Moore also included Democratic Sens. Angela Alsobrooks and Chris Van Hollen and Democratic Reps. Steny Hoyer and Glenn Ivey, said “the Greenbelt site continues to offer the lowest cost to the American taxpayer, the greatest transit accessibility and the most certain construction schedule.”"

    "title": "Investigators dig into the “why” of the American Airlines crash",
    "content": "WASHINGTON – As search efforts continue, federal officials are launching multiple investigations into the cause of the mid-air collision between an American Airlines passenger jet and a U.S. Army Black Hawk.\nThe National Transportation Safety Board, the lead agency in the investigation, is pledging a thorough review of the incident.\n“We are going to leave no stone unturned,” said Todd Inman, NTSB board member and spokesperson for the investigation. “We will help find out what happened. We will do it factually. We will do it accurately.”\nEmergency responders have now pulled more than two dozen people from the plane and the helicopter, officials said, but many more are still missing. More updates about the 64 people on board the plane and three on the helicopter will come from Washington’s medical examiner, NTSB officials said.\nThe passenger jet, American Eagle Flight 5342, was traveling from Wichita, Kansas, to Washington when it collided with the helicopter on Wednesday night. More than 300 local responders showed up at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport to try and find survivors. There were none. \n“Were absolutely heartbroken for the family and loved ones of the passengers and crew members, and also for those that were on the military aircraft,” American Airlines CEO Robert Isom said. “This is devastating. We are all hurting incredibly.” \nBut as families begin grappling with news of what happened, a range of public agencies are digging into the more complicated questions of how, and why. \nSecretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said the U.S. Army and the Department of Defense are launching investigations. Hegseth says the 12th Aviation Battalion, the Black Hawk’s unit, will undergo “a 48-hour operational pause on contingency mission” to review the incident.\nAt the time of the collision, Hegseth said, the Army helicopter was conducting a required annual night evaluation flight, operated by “a fairly experienced crew” using night-vision goggles. Speculation about the cause of the crash has focused on the high-traffic airspace around the airport.\n“We anticipate that the investigation will quickly be able to determine whether the aircraft was in the corridor and at the right altitude at the time of the incident,” Hegseth said.\nSecretary of Transportation Sean Duffy said he believes the collision was “absolutely” preventable. \n“It was a clear night,” Duffy said. “The helicopter was in a standard flight pattern. The American airline flight coming in to land was in a standard flight pattern as it was coming into DCA,” as the airport is known.\nOfficials have located both aircrafts and are working to recover the fuselage of the plane and its contents, pieces that will become part of the investigation. \n“We will not rest until we have answers for the families, and for the flying public,” Duffy said. “You should be assured that when you fly, you are safe.”\nNTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy described the investigation as “an all-hands-on-deck event.” \nStill, there is so much that isn’t yet known. In a press briefing Thursday, Trump suggested that “common sense” points to diversity, equity and inclusion programs in the federal government as a factor for the collision, but he offered no evidence beyond that. \nHe said his administration will investigate the cause more specifically.\n“Well find out how this disaster occurred,” Trump said, “and well ensure that nothing like this ever happens again.”"

    "title": "Travelers at Reagan reflect on safety – and life – after fatal crash",
    "content": "WASHINGTON – Lynn Vera stood in front of the departure board for American Airlines at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport Thursday morning. Red rows lined the screen, marking more flights canceled than delayed.\nWhile she was driving to the airport, Vera had gotten a text from a friend asking if she would fly despite the crash of an American Airlines jet and an Army helicopter.\n“Too many things happen too fast at our time of life,” Vera, 70, said. “Am I afraid that its going to happen again today? No.”\nAs Vera arrived at the airport, recovery crews searched the nearby Potomac River.\n“I just feel for the families and for these young people who had a life of joy and fitness and travel ahead of them,” Vera said. “Just, it’s tragic.”\nBut she still made the journey to the airport. She flew into Washington the other day from Vermont to visit friends. Now, at 10 a.m., she was on her way to her next destination.\nAmerican Airlines Flight 5342 and a Black Hawk helicopter collided midair Wednesday night before plummeting into the Potomac River near the airport. Officials say they don’t believe there are any survivors among the 64 on the plane and three on the helicopter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA post shared by Maryland Capital News Service (@cnsmd)\n\n\n\nNormally bustling with hurried travelers, the airport’s North Security Checkpoint was relatively quiet Thursday morning.\nAs the morning hours progressed, travelers slowly began to file into the airport. Foot traffic began to pick up at the luggage check-in. Kiosks began to see more visitors. Conversations – not just overhead announcements and the low rumbling of the metro – carried through the halls.\nVera had no concern that this “freak accident” would impact her as a traveler, she said, but she still felt the reverberations of the emotional event.\nDaniela and Macarena Carrera, two sisters from Lima, Peru, arrived at the airport later that morning. They sat on the floor across from the check-in point, guarding their luggage as their parents returned their rental car.\nFlying is a big deal for Macarena, 19, who is usually scared of traveling by plane. When their family flew into Washington the other day, it was no different.\nThen the helicopter collided with Flight 5342.\nBut the family still showed up at DCA to fly to Miami, where Daniela, 24, is registered to compete in a half marathon on Sunday.\n“I’m shaking inside,” Macarena said through nervous laughter.\n“Yeah, it’s pretty scary,” Daniela said. “But what I tell her is the possibility of a plane crash is one in a million.”\nWhile they had different feelings about flying, both sisters had been concerned that their flight would join the nearly 300 flights out of Reagan National Airport that never left the tarmac by Thursday afternoon. Overall, more than 500 flights scheduled to arrive and depart from the airport were canceled, according to FlightAware.\nAs operations resume inside the airport, investigators are still trying to determine the cause of the deadly crash."

    "title": "Without evidence, Trump blames DEI hires and Democrats for deadly plane collision",
    "content": "WASHINGTON—President Donald Trump on Thursday blamed the Obama and Biden administration diversity policies for Wednesdays fatal collision of a jetliner and helicopter near Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport.\nTrump offered no evidence for his speculations at a White House press conference, but said “I have common sense” when asked to elaborate.\n“We have to have our smartest people. It doesnt matter what they look like, how they speak, who they are…they cant have regular people (serving as air traffic controllers). They wont be able to do it,” Trump said.\nAviation experts and lawmakers criticized Trump for breaking established investigation protocols with conjecture.\nHistorically, presidents have not speculated on the causes of disasters of this kind before investigators have made at least preliminary assessments. Jon Ostrower, editor-in-chief of The Air Current, which covers aviation, noted on X that Americans are “watching in real-time the systematic unraveling of decades of aviation safety accident investigative precedent.”\nOn Wednesday night, an American Airlines plane collided in midair with a Black Hawk helicopter as the jet was on final approach to Reagan National. The plane, flying from Wichita, Kansas, was carrying 60 passengers and four flight crew members, while the helicopter was conducting a routine retraining flight with three military personnel onboard.\nDive teams were retrieving bodies from the Potomac River and officials said there were no survivors.\nTrump was joined by Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, newly appointed Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy and Vice President J.D. Vance, all of whom doubled down on Trump’s anti-DEI remarks and praised his leadership.\nThe Federal Aviation Administration under the Obama Administration implemented a directive to diversify its workforce that was “too white,” Trump said.\nVance charged that “many hundreds of people were suing the government because they would like to be air traffic controllers but they were turned away because of the color of their skin.”\nThe collision took place just over a week after the president signed an executive order on Jan. 21 titled “Keeping Americans Safe in Aviation,” touted as returning to merit-based hiring and removing DEI initiatives at the FAA.\nIn response to Trump’s DEI remarks, National Transportation Safety Board Chair Jennifer Homendy said during a media briefing that “as part of any investigation, we look at the human, the machine and the environment, so we will look at all the humans that were involved in this accident.”\nAlong with DEI, Trump also placed blame on the helicopter pilots, who he said wrongfully flew at the same height as the aircraft and took an “unbelievably bad” angle.\n“The people in the helicopter should have seen where they were going,” Trump said. “I can’t imagine people with 20-20 vision not seeing what’s happening up there.”\nJohn Cox, president and CEO of Safety Operating Systems LLC and a veteran airline and general aviation pilot who has worked on NTSB investigations, told MSNBC that Trump’s remarks are “contrary to what worldwide investigation protocols demand.”\n“The standards have never changed,” he said. “To allege that these pilots were somehow substandard, to allege that the controllers were somehow substandard—at the very minimum is very premature and without foundation.\nTrump also directly attacked former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, saying he ran the government agency “right into the ground with his diversity” and calling him a “disaster as a mayor.”\nButtigieg responded in a statement on X: “Despicable. As families grieve, Trump should be leading, not lying. One of his first acts was to fire and suspend some of the key personnel who helped keep our skies safe. Time for the President to show actual leadership and explain what he will do to prevent this from happening again.\nTrump announced that he was “immediately appointing” Christopher Rocheleau as acting FAA administrator. Rocheleau currently is serving as deputy administrator of the agency. The FAA has not had a leader since former Administrator Michael Whitaker stepped down from the position on Jan. 20 after being pressured to resign by Elon Musk.\nThe NTSB has yet to release any information about potential causes in its ongoing investigation. The agency plans to release information as it comes and intends to issue a preliminary report within 30 days, according to J. Todd Inman, the NTSB member in charge of the investigation.\nSeveral other lawmakers and aviation experts expressed dismay over Trump’s comments.\nSen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Maryland, said Trump was politicizing a tragedy, “jumping to outrageous conclusions and undermining ongoing investigations.”\n“His comments were grotesque and outrageous and he owes the American people an apology, the senator wrote on X.\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-New York, and NAACP President Derrick Johnson also criticized the president for politicizing the accident and pushing false and inflammatory claims during the ongoing investigation.\n“It’s one thing for internet pundits to spew off conspiracies, it’s another for the president of the United States to throw out idle speculation as bodies are still being recovered and families are still notified,” Schumer said on the Senate floor Thursday.\n“Using the highest office in the land to sow hatred rooted in falsehoods is unpresidential, divisive, and downright disgusting,” Johnson wrote on X."

    "title": "Maryland joins fight against Trump’s order to end birthright citizenship",
    "content": "ANNAPOLIS – Maryland joined more than a dozen other states on Tuesday in challenging President Donald Trump’s executive order to end the birthright citizenship the U.S. extends to all people born in the country regardless of their parents’ legal status.\nAnthony G. Brown, Maryland’s attorney general, said the Trump order violates the 14th Amendment as well as federal law. Brown and the other attorneys general filed the suit against Trump in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts.\n“Birthright citizenship is a right enshrined in our Constitution,” Brown said in a press release issued on Tuesday. “It is a reflection of our country’s ideals, a belief that every baby born on U.S. soil is a member of our great nation and deserves to play a part in its future.”\nThe 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution says that “all persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside.”\nEnding that, said Brown, would be “un-American.”\n“Our office will vigorously challenge this blatantly unconstitutional decision in court,” he said.\nThe order was one of Trump’s very first executive acts after his inauguration this week. Posted on the White House website, the order says that citizenship should not be granted to a person whose mother was unlawfully or temporarily present in the U.S. at the time of the child’s birth, and whose father was not a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident.\nTrump issued the order on Monday amid a slew of executive orders that ranged from withdrawing the U.S. from the World Health Organization to announcing pardons for people convicted or criminally charged in the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol.\nAccording to the filing, Maryland joins in the suit with the states of New Jersey, Massachusetts, California, New York, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Michigan, Colorado, Delaware, Nevada, Hawaii, Maine, Minnesota, New Mexico, Vermont, Wisconsin and North Carolina along with Washington, D.C., and the city and county of San Francisco.\n“In his inaugural remarks, President Trump promised to ‘restore fair, equal and impartial justice under the constitutional rule of law,’” U.S. Rep. Steny Hoyer, D-Maryland, said in a statement sent to Capital News Service. “He betrayed his own words almost immediately by pardoning roughly 1,500 people convicted of crimes related to the Jan. 6 insurrection.”\nAdvocates are also gearing up to fight the Trump order.\n“It is such an obvious violation of the Constitution,” Jossie Flor Sapunar, the national communications director for CASA, a Latino advocacy organization, told CNS. “The 14th Amendment is very clear in the guarantee that any person born or naturalized in the U.S. is a citizen of the U.S. and whatever state they reside in.”\nThe organization is preparing to file its own lawsuit against Trump, she said.\n“The fact that President Trump thinks that he is higher in power than the Constitution is wrong,” Sapunar said, “and he’s going to find out just how quick he is mistaken.”"

    "title": "Trump draws boos and cheers from weekend crowds",
    "content": "WASHINGTON, D.C. – Activists from across the country are gathering in the nation’s capital this weekend, some celebrating the upcoming inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump while others are pledging to resist his policies. \nSaturday’s demonstrations united progressives in concern over the future despite the divisions that led to Democratic losses in the 2024 presidential election. Sunday will feature a pro-Trump victory rally at Capital One Arena, offering a contrast to the protest events.\n“To everyone here, the division needs to stop. We are stronger together,” Nee Nee Taylor, executive director of Harriet’s Wildest Dreams, declared to the protesters gathered around the Lincoln Memorial.\nThese gatherings are in anticipation of Monday’s inauguration of Trump, an event that is moving indoors due to predictions of bitter cold weather. But the frigid temperatures haven’t deterred thousands of people from filling the streets of Washington this weekend, standing firm in their commitment to their cause. \nThe People’s March, rebranded from the Women’s March in 2017, aimed to unite a broad coalition of individuals. Marchers, gathering from separate rallies focused on different causes, converged at the Lincoln Memorial to unite women, LGBTQ+ people, immigrants and other marginalized groups under a shared banner of resistance.\nCandace Mosely, a Washington resident, said she often shows up for marches in the area, but noted that todays event gave her hope for a larger purpose.\n“It’s great that someone put together this march that brings together all of these topics,” she said, “and bring together everyone who’s trying to make the world better, and hopefully fight together.”\nWith an LGBTQ+ flag draped across his chest, Julien Freville carried his 29-month-old son, Orson, to the protest. Freville said it was important to show him how powerful and positive a protest could be.\n“We’ve lost a lot of hope lately,” Freville told Capital News Service. “To be here with people who share and defend values like mine is very empowering and gives me hope.”\nDawn Fichtner, said that her reason for attending the protest was her disbelief that the country would elect a “convicted felon” to office. She said the march demonstrates there are “still people who think that American democracy is worth fighting for.”\n“American democracy will triumph over this,” said Fichtner.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA post shared by Maryland Capital News Service (@cnsmd)\n\n\n\nMary Pellicano and Lorie Masters marched side by side at the protest. Pellicano held a sign that read, “Hate Will Never Make America Great.”\n“I’m here for my children,” said Pellicano.“They need to see me model resistance, and standing up for what’s right, and when things are not right, you need to speak up and not be afraid.”\nMasters said her activism began in 2000, following the Supreme Courts intervention in the presidential election.\n“At that point, I thought it was really critical to get involved in the political process and make my voice heard,” said Masters. “Since then, there are so many issues that are important to me  women’s rights, civil rights, and human rights, and also Im a resident of D.C. and we dont have the rights every other American has.”\nCara Fortner, a Unitarian Universalist minister from Virginia, marched alongside her 11-year-old daughter, Eleanor, for her daughters first protest. During the march, a fellow Unitarian from Florida approached her, recognizing her by the sign she was carrying.\n“It is part of our faith to live our faith in the real world,” Fortner said.\nThe Women’s March, one of the groups behind Saturday’s demonstration, gained recognition for its first event, which drew more than 1 million participants from across the nation after Trump’s first inauguration. \nTrump’s first term saw significant reversals on progressive policies, including the Supreme Courts 2022 Dobbs decision, which overturned Roe v. Wade and ended federal abortion protections. His administration opposed the Equality Act and appointed numerous judges with anti-LGBTQ+ views, cementing a long-term conservative shift in the judiciary.\nDespite his contentious record, Trump’s voter base expanded in 2024. He saw increased support from white women, though Black women overwhelmingly opposed him. Activists at the People’s March said they viewed these shifts as a call to action.  \n“Were poised to be nimble and to pivot where we need to and to respond to needs as they arise,” Fortner said, “that’s a good feeling.”"

    "title": "Jimmy Carter&#8217;s state funeral marks end of an era",
    "content": "WASHINGTON, D.C. – The nation bid farewell to former President Jimmy Carter in a state funeral at the Washington National Cathedral on Thursday, honoring his life, legacy and progressive humanitarian approach to leadership.\nAll five living presidents, past and present, attended to remember the 39th president. The funeral included previously written eulogies by former President Gerald Ford and Carter’s former Vice President Walter Mondale, read by their sons, Steven Ford and Ted Mondale.\nPresident Biden, who was the first Democratic senator to endorse Carter’s bid for presidency in 1976, also gave a speech in honor of Carter.\n“Throughout his life, he showed us what it means to be a practitioner of good works, a good and faithful servant of God and people today,” he said. “Many think he was from a bygone era, but in reality, he saw well into the future.”\nGrandsons Joshua, Jason and James Carter spoke at the service. In an emotional tribute, Jason emphasized the love his grandfather brought to the world.\n“He waged peace with love and respect,” he said. “He led this nation with love and respect. For me, this life was a love story from the moment that he woke up until he laid his head.”\nfather brought to the world.\nCarter, the longest-lived president in U.S. history, died on Dec. 29 at the age of 100. His work of making global public health and humanitarian rights central to his agenda drew praise and admiration from people of all political angles. His death marked the end of an era, as the country now prepares for the Trump administration’s re-enter to the White House on Jan. 20.\nOutside of the cathedral, through the sound of church bells, the beat of drums and brisk winds, onlookers remembered Carter for his love of the people.\nThi Le, a Washington resident, stepped out onto his porch to watch the funeral procession despite the biting cold.\n“I was impressed by his relatively young age in the presidency, and then his accomplishments after his presidency,” Le said.\n“I just turned 42, so I’m kind of comparing, what have I done with myself to this point?” Le said. “He was president in his 50s and obviously accomplished quite a bit. That was just the halfway point for him through his life.”\nHsin-Fu Wu traveled from Tucson, Arizona, for the funeral. He recounted how Carter had stopped to speak with him on the submarine named after the president in the early 2000s. Carter’s legacy is grounded in “his persistence in bringing peace and to live in integrity despite the opposition of the politics,” Wu said.\nHe proudly wore a navy blue baseball cap with “USS Jimmy Carter” embroidered across the front.\nNancy Edson shared her admiration for Carter’s dedication, praising his post-presidency efforts to combat diseases and his work with Habitat for Humanity.\nStanding in the cold to witness the funeral procession, Edson told Capital News Service it was “the least she could do for everything that he and his family did in the world.”\n“[I] hope that some of it can rub off on me, and I can do more to help the world in my own way,” Edson said. “I don’t think I can do as much as he did, but you gotta start somewhere.”\nMembers of the Maryland General Assembly also paid tribute to the late president.\n“His presidency may have been marked by significant challenges, rising energy costs, inflation and international crises, but Carter consistently approached these issues with honesty, humility … and a deep commitment to doing what was right, not just what was politically convenient,” said Sen. Benjamin Brooks Sr., a Democrat representing Baltimore County, speaking to the Maryland Senate on Thursday.\nHouse Speaker Adrienne Jones, a Democrat from Baltimore County, reflected on how Carter’s policies shaped her life on the House floor in advance of the funeral.\n“During his administration, he greatly expanded a federal program called the Comprehensive Employee and Training Act,” Jones said. “Thanks to him, I got my first job in public service. I had just graduated from UMBC and didn’t know what my next step would be, but CETA was the answer.”\nJones also praised Carter for demonstrating how government programs can empower individuals and communities.\n“When I think about public service, I think of the late President Jimmy Carter,” she said.\nThe state funeral follows a weeklong series of tributes in Carter’s home state of Georgia. On Tuesday, his body was transported to the nation’s capital for the state funeral.\nHis family plans to lay him to rest this week in his hometown of Plains, alongside his wife, Rosalynn."

    "title": "Trump and GOP Congress will have a 60-day deregulation fast pass",
    "content": "WASHINGTON – With President-elect Donald Trump entering the Oval Office in January with a Republican majority in Congress, his administration may wield an influential tool to establish its deregulation agenda from the get-go: an obscure law called the Congressional Review Act (CRA).\nExperts anticipate that the CRA will be applied liberally as Trump works to deliver on his promises to reverse many of Democratic President Joe Biden’s administration policies.\nWhen Trump became president in 2017 – after two terms served by Democratic President Barack Obama – he made quick use of the CRA, disapproving 16 rules.\n“I think theres a lot of interest from Republicans on the Hill to get as many of these (joint resolutions of disapproval through the CRA) across the line as they feasibly can,” Dan Goldbeck, director of regulatory policy at the American Action Forum, an independent, nonprofit organization that analyzes domestic economic issues from a center-right perspective, told Capital News Service. “I would not be surprised to see them exceed their 2017 total.”\nThe CRA allows an incoming administration that follows a preceding administration of an opposing party to overturn rules created by federal agencies. Congress must agree to the reversals through joint resolutions of disapproval. \nOnce a resolution of disapproval has been passed by both chambers of Congress and signed by the president, the targeted regulatory rule is void and the federal agency that drafted it is blocked from introducing another rule in “substantially the same form.” \n“This has been four years of a liberal Biden administration,” Sarah Hay, a policy analyst at The George Washington University Regulatory Studies Center, told CNS. “Going into next year, theres going to be unified Republican control of both Congress and the presidency. This is the lightest lift way to overturn regulations issued by a prior administration that you disagree with.”\nPassed in 1996 under President Bill Clinton, the CRA is used most often after a presidential transition in which there is a switch in party affiliation in the White House. The CRA allows a new Congress and president to look back to the previous Congress within 60 working days before the session’s end and overturn final rules issued by federal agencies. \nWhen the 119th Congress convenes in January, those regulations issued during the 118th Congress within the lookback period are subject to review and potential action. While regulations aren’t actually passed by Congress, the body grants appropriate federal agencies the authority to issue regulations.\nDoubling down, the CRA also provides an expedited procedure for the Senate to avoid the threat of the filibuster under certain criteria, requiring only a 51-vote simple majority.\n“That makes it a very attractive tool,” Steven Balla, co-director of The George Washington University Regulatory Studies Center, said. “Under normal legislative procedure (the Senate) needs a filibuster-proof majority, which is going to be essentially impossible for them to come by when it comes to disapproving Biden administration regulations. It provides a way around some of those super majoritarian constraints in the Senate.”\nThe first Trump administration’s reversal of 16 rules marked the largest single batch of rule disapprovals in history and topped the total previous reversals combined under earlier administrations.\n!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r=0;r\nExperts said they expect that a second Trump term will see even more repeals, erasing a significant number of rules issued under the Biden Administration. \nGoldbeck pointed to two EPA rules that may be particularly susceptible to reversal due to their potential significant costs. A rule establishing a system to phase down over 15 years the use of hydrofluorocarbons (HFC’s), which contribute to climate change, and a rule dealing with replacing the country’s lead pipes to increase safety in drinking water are both major regulations passed within the look-back period that could be overturned, according to Goldbeck.\n“When you look at the rules that they disapproved of (in the last Trump term), many of them weren't very significant,” Balla said. “They weren't economically significant, they weren't really headline-generating rules. It almost seemed like it was a haphazard, scattershot approach.”\nTwo such nullified rules that were not deemed economically significant were the Department of Labor’s Savings Arrangements Established by States for Non-Governmental Employees and a Department of the Interior Stream Protection Rule intended to protect water supplies, streams and wildlife from the adverse impacts of surface coal mining. \nSenate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky published an April, 2017 statement crediting the Trump administration and Congress for their use of the CRA, citing rule reversals on education, an anti-coal mining rule and a rule restricting Alaska's ability to manage wildlife on federal lands.\n“Regulations aren’t issued in a vacuum; they have real economic consequences that can harm the middle class,” McConnell said during floor remarks on March 6, 2017. “They can kill jobs, raise prices, depress wages and lower opportunities … Fortunately, we now have the opportunity to provide relief from some of these costly, duplicative rules using the tools provided by the Congressional Review Act, or CRA.”\n!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r=0;r\nBalla said this time around, the Trump administration will approach its deregulation efforts more strategically.\nThe Congressional Research Center estimates that August 1, 2024 will likely be the cut-off date for subjecting all Biden administration rules submitted to the House or Senate on or after that date to the CRA lookback provisions. \nAccording to the George Washington Regulatory Study Center’s Congressional Review Act Window Exploratory Dashboard, 70 significant rules are susceptible to being struck down. Twenty-seven of those rules are deemed economically significant, meaning they each would be likely to impose an annual impact of the economy of at least $200 million.\nAccording to Balla, in the coming weeks, Republican think tanks, policy foundations and Republican lawmakers likely will start publicly highlighting rules they want to present as joint resolutions of disapproval on the CRA chopping block. \n“I would think that the Republican leadership on both the House and Senate side will want to play a role in this,” Balla said. “In looking from the outside at what they disapproved of last time, there wasn't much of a concerted leadership strategy – I would guess that's going to be quite different this time around.”"

    "title": "NASA to Maryland lawmakers: &#8216;High risk&#8217; Goddard project had unrealistic launch schedule",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  NASA described a plan to launch a multi-billion dollar spacecraft in 2026 as “overly optimistic and not credible” in a September letter to Maryland lawmakers that Capital News Service obtained through Freedom of Information Act requests.\nOn Sept. 4, NASA informed Congress it was ending the $2 billion OSAM-1 project, which was expected to service existing satellites and expand their lifespans in space, among other capabilities.\nTwelve days after the announcement, nine Maryland lawmakers demanded that NASA explain why it cancelled the project, which was based at the Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland.\nIn its response, dated Sept. 25, NASA cited numerous risks, an overly ambitious plan and a low return on investment as rationales for ending the project.\n“The majority of NASA technology demonstrations are less complex and have orders of magnitude lower project lifecycle costs (in the $10 million-$100 million range) than OSAM-1,” said the letter signed by Alicia Brown, NASA’s associate administrator for the office of legislative and intergovernmental affairs. “Therefore, NASA is willing to take more risk in managing these technology demonstration projects. … OSAM-1 is considered by NASA to be a high cost and highly complex project.”\nMultiple parts of NASA’s response were redacted in the copy of the letter CNS obtained.\nSince its start in 2015, the OSAM-1 project has been subjected to sizable cost increases and delays, leading to NASA first announcing the missions shutdown on March 1. The agency has stood firm on its decision despite urging from the Congress, especially members of the Maryland delegation.\nThe NASA website for the project says the OSAM-1 mission “is developing an unprecedented capability for a robust, cost-effective space infrastructure.”\nDespite NASA’s insistence on cancelling the mission, Maryland lawmakers continually have advocated for OSAM-1 to proceed, citing the importance of the project and the efforts of the workers at Goddard. As of Aug. 31, OSAM-1 had 249 contractors and 76 civil servants associated with the project, the letter said.\nIn a statement, Maryland Sens. Ben Cardin and Chris Van Hollen, as well as Maryland Reps. Steny Hoyer and Glenn Ivey, maintained their criticism of NASA for ending the mission. Rep. Dutch Ruppersberger separately told CNS he concurred with the sentiments of his fellow Democrats.\n“This critical program provided NASA a distinct solution to a difficult challenge: maintaining our satellites in space,” the lawmakers said.\n“With the capabilities being developed by OSAM-1, NASA had the opportunity to both service satellites while still in orbit and extend the useful lives of these valuable assets,” they said. “In its shortsighted decision to cancel this mission, NASA has put these important long-term benefits aside, while also undermining the tireless efforts of our Goddard workforce.”\nAn OSAM-1 independent review estimated development of the mission would cost $1.6 billion, a 200 percent increase since its inception. Originally targeted to launch in 2020, OSAM-1 was years behind schedule.\nCongress provided $227 million for OSAM-1 in the 2024 fiscal year budget and had a 2026 target launch for the spacecraft.\nIn the letter, NASA said any plan for a 2026 launch would involve risks not normally taken for a project this expensive. To execute the mission, NASA would have had to treat OSAM-1 as a Class D mission according to the letter, which normally represents a “lower priority mission with medium to low complexity.”\nThe cost to launch the proposed mission would be $353 million as of Oct. 1, while the shut down costs are $29 million, according to the letter.\nOne of the major dangers of the 2026 plan, according to the letter, was a reduction in testing. With the new plan, there would be less testing on the overall system, on the launch site and on some of the systems within the spacecraft.\n“The project replanned OSAM-1 to adopt a ‘Class D-like’ risk posture typically reserved for smallsats and lower value, high risk tolerant assets – not a $2 billion spacecraft,” the letter said.\nDespite OSAM-1 ending prematurely, NASA emphasized to the Maryland delegation that it sees Goddard as vital.\nGoddard is home to the Nancy Grace Roman telescope, the Atmosphere Observing System mission and plays an important role in managing the Near Space Network, which provides communications services to missions within one million miles of earth, including the International Space Station.\nDespite their disappointment, the Democratic lawmakers said they were committed to supporting contributions to space exploration coming out of Goddard.\n“We strongly disagree with NASA’s decision and are deeply disappointed with their moving forward, despite clear Congressional opposition,” the lawmakers said. “Together, we will be fighting to secure critical funding for Goddard and Maryland’s major future programs.”"

    "title": "As top Democrat on House judiciary panel, Maryland’s Raskin says rule of law will be top priority",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  Expected to be the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee in January, Maryland Rep. Jamie Raskin said he is focused on safeguarding the Constitution. His Democratic colleagues say he’s ready to lead.\n“My top priority is to defend the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, the rule of law, and the freedoms of the people,” Raskin told Capital News Service Thursday. \nRaskin revealed on Monday that he was challenging veteran Rep. Jerry Nadler of New York for the top Democratic spot on the judiciary panel. Nadler, who served as chairman and ranking Democrat on the committee for seven years, removed himself from the running Wednesday after House Democrats began shifting towards Raskin.\nCurrently, there do not appear to be other competitors for the judiciary seat, but Raskin said “you never know what’s going to happen on Capitol Hill.”\nIn Nadler’s letter to his colleagues announcing his decision to relinquish his position, he called Raskin an “exceptional leader” and a spokesperson for Democratic Party values.\n“Im very grateful to Chairman Nadler for the extraordinary work hes done and continues to do in Congress,” Raskin told CNS. “If Im lucky enough to become the ranking member, I would lean on him very heavily on every major important decision.”\nRaskin’s move is part of an effort among some younger House Democrats to replace older colleagues at the top of some committees.\nRaskin, who turns 62 on Dec. 13, starts his fifth House term in January. Nadler, 77, will begin his 17th term next month.\nIf selected, Raskin would act as a counterpoint to the chairman, Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, a staunch Donald Trump ally.\nTo get the appointment, Raskin will have to be nominated by the Democratic Steering and Policy Committee and voted on by the Democratic Caucus, according to the Congressional Research Service. \nRep. Glenn Ivey, D-Maryland, a current judiciary committee member, pointed to Raskin’s work to defeat an impeachment inquiry against President Joe Biden in the House Oversight and Accountability Committee as emblematic of the work he would do in the judiciary committee. \n“I think hell bring a lot of energy. Hes very dynamic, and as he showed on the oversight committee, thatll play well on judiciary,” Ivey said. \nRaskin currently serves as the ranking member on the House oversight panel, where he was a frequent critic of Republican policies and clashed often with the chairman, Rep. James Comer, R-Kentucky. \nOversight committee member Rep. Maxwell Frost, D-Florida, told CNS that Raskin has been a mentor to him in his first term in Congress. Raskin is a team-builder in his current ranking member role, Frost said, leading fellow lawmakers in messaging sessions and team workshops.  \n“He has the grit and grace needed to be the ranking member of such an important committee, and Im excited for him to take over the reins of judiciary, too, because we need him now more than ever,” Frost said. \nThe House Judiciary Committee is a standing committee that deals with legal matters including the federal courts, constitutional amendments, monopolies and, rarely, impeachments. \nIn his Monday letter to colleagues announcing his run, Raskin said the committee is the Democrats “front-line of defense” to protect freedom, the integrity of the Justice Department and the FBI, and the security of the Constitution against the incoming Trump administration. \n“We are in the fight of our lives,” Raskin wrote.\nEach one of us must reflect hard and decide — in close consultation with colleagues and leadership —where we can be most personally effective in the fight to recapture a majority in Congress that can promote national progress,” the Marylander told his colleagues.\nFellow Maryland Democratic Rep. Dutch Ruppersberger told CNS. that Raskin is a leader who pulls people together and is well-prepared to argue his case. \nHes one of the biggest people that you can always rely on. Hell always tell the truth, and when he believes in something, hell fight for it,” Ruppersberger said. \nRaskin, a former constitutional law professor and Maryland state senator, was the lead impeachment manager in Trump’s second impeachment trial and is a member of the House’s Jan. 6th Select Committee."

    "title": "On the basis of sex? SCOTUS hears arguments on Tennessee trans care ban",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  The Supreme Court heard oral arguments Wednesday about the constitutionality of Tennessee’s 2023 ban on gender-affirming health care for minors.\nThe landmark case, United States v. Skrmetti, could have widespread implications for other restrictions on transgender health care across the country and for a potential national ban on gender-affirming care.\nDuring arguments, U.S. Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar argued the Tennessee law violates equal protection under the 14th Amendment by discriminating based on sex.\n“If you change the individual’s sex, it changes the result,” Prelogar said.\nThe Tennessee law, known as SB1, prohibits health care providers from administering certain medical treatments to transgender youth, including puberty blockers and hormone therapy.\nTennessee Solicitor General J. Matthew Rice defended the legislation on behalf of Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti, telling justices the state is restricting such medical treatments based on their purpose.\nWASHINGTON  Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti speaks to reporters in front of the Supreme Court steps on Wednesday. (Andrea Durán/Capital News Service)\n“Using hormones and puberty blockers to address a physical condition is far different from using it to address psychological distress associated with one’s body,” Rice said. “The Equal Protection Clause does not require the states to blind themselves to medical reality or to treat unlike things the same.”\n“It’s a dodge to say that this is not based on sex, it’s based on medical purpose, when the medical purpose is utterly and entirely about sex,” Justice Elena Kagan said.\nThe American Civil Liberties Union and other legal advocates sued Tennesseee in April 2023 to block the ban on behalf of several Tennessee youths, their families and a health care provider.\nA district court judge temporarily blocked Tennessee’s law from going into effect in June 2023, but the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit later reversed its decision.\nThe Biden administration petitioned the Supreme Court to review the case in November 2023.\nAddressing justices Wednesday, ACLU attorney Chase Strangio became the first openly transgender attorney to argue before the Supreme Court.\n“By banning treatment only when it allows an adolescent to live, identify, or appear inconsistent with their birth sex, SB1 warrants heightened scrutiny under decades of precedent,” Strangio said.\nWASHINGTON  ACLU attorney Chase Strangio addresses the press in front of the Supreme Court on Wednesday. (Andrea Durán/Capital News Service)\nThe scientific evidence underpinning gender-affirming care was a key element of debate among justices and counsel. Strangio and Prelogar cited clinical studies in the United States showing this type of care can lower depression, anxiety and thoughts of suicide among teens.\nArguing to the contrary, Rice said some individuals experience regret and “de-transition” after receiving care.\nIn an exchange between Rice and Justice Clarence Thomas about such cases, Justice Sonya Sotomayor interjected: “I’m sorry, counselor. Every medical treatment has a risk, even taking aspirin. There is always going to be a percentage of the population under any medical treatment that’s going to suffer a harm.”\n“Tennessee lawmakers enacted SB1 to protect minors from risky, unproven medical interventions,” Rice said.\nIn exchanges with Justice Samuel Alito and Chief Justice John Roberts, Rice said countries in Europe, such as the United Kingdom and Sweden, which were years ahead of the United States in providing this care, are now reconsidering whether the benefits outweigh the risks.\n“It strikes me as a pretty heavy yellow light, if not red light, for this court to come in, the nine of us, and just constitutionalize the whole area,” Justice Brett Kavanaugh said.\nJustice Ketanji Brown Jackson repeatedly expressed concern over how Tennessee was skirting the question of equal protection. Referring to the courts 1976 decision in Virginia v. Loving that struck down laws banning interracial marriage, Jackson said: “Im worried that were undermining the foundations of some of our bedrock equal protection cases.”\nJustice Neil Gorsuch, considered a swing vote in this case, was nearly silent throughout the two-and-a-half hours of oral arguments.\nIn her closing rebuttal, Prelogar raised the possibility of the incoming conservative Congress passing a nationwide ban on gender-affirming care.\nShould the Supreme Court uphold Tennessee’s law, Prelogar suggested, the precedent would be established for the constitutionality of bans on gender-affirming care nationwide.\nTennessee has enacted 21 anti-LGBTQ+ laws since 2015, the most in the nation. The ACLU has tracked more than 550 anti-LGBTQ+ bills introduced in 42 states this year alone, many of which are specifically anti-transgender bills.\nMore than half of U.S. states have restricted access to gender-affirming care for minors. This year, Ohio, Wyoming, South Carolina and New Hampshire banned such access, and Arkansas’s and Montana’s bans are currently halted and blocked due to legal challenges.\nInterested parties from across the globe weighed in on the case in amicus briefs for the courts consideration, including 50 briefs supporting Skrmetti and more than 30 opinions from advocates for transgender health care.\nFive Democratic Maryland lawmakers joined other members of Congress in signing an amicus brief urging the court to strike down Tennessee’s ban.\nThe letter, which was signed by Sens. Ben Cardin and Chris Van Hollen as well as Reps. Jamie Raskin, David Trone and John Sarbanes, said that “concerning adolescents, the people best situated to make decisions about gender-affirming care are the patients, their parents, and their health care providers — not politicians.”\nThe American Psychological Association wrote in its brief to the court that gender-affirming care is “effective, evidence-based, and safe.” The APA cited studies showing that treatments like puberty blockers and hormone therapy improve the quality of life for transgender youth while lowering the risk for anxiety, depression and self-harm.\nAs conservative governors and state legislatures across the nation have passed anti-transgender laws in recent years, this case and others like it have been mired in public controversy.\nHundreds of protesters both opposing and supporting SB1 gathered outside the court Wednesday and roads around the court were closed to safely accommodate demonstrations.\nLandon Richie, a 22-year-old organizer from Texas, traveled to Washington to show support for transgender youth and their advocates. Richie began receiving gender-affirming care when he was 13.\n“I received this life-saving, medically necessary, age-appropriate care as a minor myself, and the impact that it had on my life is hard to put into words,” Richie, who is the policy coordinator for the Transgender Education Network of Texas, told Capital News Service. “If I had been forced to wait until 18, I dont know if I honestly would have made it to that age.”\nThe case is going to have nationwide implications, Richie emphasized.\n“It is our futures that are on the line, the futures of trans youth who deserve every access and right and joy that anybody else has,” he explained.\nJamie Reed of St. Louis, Missouri, came to Washington to advocate in favor of the Tennessee ban. The 44-year-old worked at a youth gender center for five years before filing a complaint that the center’s gender-affirming care practices were physically and emotionally harming children, she said.\nWASHINGTON  Jamie Reed, a protester for the Tennessee bill, SB1. (Mennatalla Ibrahim/Capital News Service)\nMultiple patients at the center regretted or faced serious risks due to gender-affirming treatments, Reed told CNS. Reed, who also said she is in the leadership of an organization of gay and lesbian opponents of gender-affirming care, said she thinks the court will rule in favor of Tennessee.\nThe court is expected to issue its opinion on United States v. Skrmetti by July.\nWhile justices deliberate, the appeals court decision upholding the ban means transgender youth in Tennessee cannot legally use puberty blockers and hormones.\nCapital News Service Washington Bureau reporter Mennatalla Ibrahim contributed to this story."

    "title": "Journalist fatalities are rising, a memorial is going up in their honor",
    "content": "WASHINGTON D.C. ⸺ When Tom Durkin was alerted in November 2012 that James Foley, a friend of more than two decades, had been kidnapped by ISIS while working as a freelance war correspondent in northwest Syria, he went to work with a group of friends to try and bring Foley home.\nOn Aug.19, 2014, Durkin received a text. It read, “I’m so sorry about what just happened.”\n“I just knew what I was going to find out.”\nDurkin flipped on his television and saw an image of his longtime friend kneeling in the sand moments before he was beheaded.\nNow details for a new memorial in the nation’s capital honoring people like Foley who lost their lives while working in journalism are being shared with the public. The Fallen Journalists Memorial, planned to be completed in 2028, will be located on the National Mall near the U.S. Capitol.\nAt least 3,100 journalists have been killed around the world since 1837 according to a Capital News Service analysis of databases of fallen journalists maintained by the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), a nonprofit that promotes press freedom and defends the rights of journalists, and the Freedom Forum, the nonprofit organization that operated the Newseum in Washington, D.C. prior to its closure at the end of 2019. Nearly 90% of those recorded deaths have occurred over the last 50 years.\nThe databases created by both organizations are a result of extensive research into each reported death and require verification before names can be added to their lists, though their parameters are different. The Freedom Forum’s database extends as far back as 1837 (and concludes in 2019), and includes names of individuals tied to newsrooms who died while in the field or otherwise as a result of their work, while CPJ’s efforts began in 1992 and includes only journalists confirmed murdered in direct reprisal for their work; in combat or crossfire; or while carrying out a dangerous assignment.\nWhen the Newseum closed, the country lost its only memorial commemorating journalists who lost their lives as a result of their work. Journalist fatalities reached a high in 2017 with 126 recorded fatalities before falling below 50 deaths per year from 2019 through 2022, according to the CNS analysis.\n“I commend people, especially young people, that still are determined to be journalists and talk truths to power and expose things, because its becoming riskier,” said Durkin, who is now the director of safety education for the James Foley foundation, an organization that promotes journalist safety and helps Americans who have a family member taken hostage overseas.\n\nThe Fallen Journalists Memorial Foundation formed in the wake of the Capital Gazette massacre. In June 2018, a gunman stormed into the publication’s newsroom in Annapolis, Md. and killed four journalists and one staff member, the deadliest attack on journalists in American history. Jarrod Ramos was given multiple life sentences for the shooting in 2021.\nCongress approved legislation for the memorial in 2020. In September, six years after the shooting, the first public images of the planned Fallen Journalist Memorial in Washington were unveiled. The memorial’s construction will be funded by a nonprofit organization created by former U.S. Representative David Dreier, who served as the chairman of the Tribune Publishing Company (the former owners of the Capital Gazette) from January 2019 through February 2020.\nThe memorial will be between the National Museum of the American Indian and the Voice of America at Independence Avenue, Maryland Avenue and 3rd Street Southwest, putting it close to the three branches of government. Each of the memorial’s entry points lead to a circular Remembrance Hall that has the First Amendment inscribed in a glass lens.\nIf the foundation meets its fundraising goals on schedule, the memorial will be completed and dedicated in June 2028, the 10th anniversary of the Capital Gazette shooting.\n“The memorial is dedicated not only to the journalists who lost their lives, but also in the words of the legislation ‘to commemorate Americas commitment to freedom of the press,’” Barbara Cochran, the president of the Fallen Journalists Memorial Foundation, told CNS.\n\nIraq leads the world in journalist fatalities by nearly double the next country on the list, with 288 incidents compared to the Philippines’ 165. Ten countries– including Syria, Mexico and Russia– make up 49% of all media-related deaths since 1975. War and civil unrest are prevalent issues among the top ten countries.\nWhen Durkin sees reports of journalists dying in combat zones like Gaza or Ukraine, he said it reminds him of the friend he lost.\n“Instances like this makes me think of Jim and like the risks that he was willing to endure to cover things in Syria, to cover things in Libya, and now youre seeing it in Gaza,” Durkin said. “Its like its this really difficult catch 22 because we need journalists to tell us whats going on, but those journalists are increasingly putting their life at risk to tell us this.”\nThe risk journalists face while working in a war zone is evident in the current conflict between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip. Prior to October 2023, just 25 journalists lost their lives in the area. As of November, that figure has risen to 156 – a more than 500% increase over a roughly 12-month period. The jump has landed Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territory in third for media fatalities among all countries with at least one fatality reported since 1974.\n“At times, it feels like theres indiscriminate bombing that journalists are just caught in the crossfire,” Durkin said.\nFallen Journalists Memorial design concept revealed to the public in September 2024. Credit: Fallen Journalists Memorial Foundation/John Ronan Architects\nWhen the Fallen Journalists Memorial is fully erected, it will have the U.S. Capitol as a backdrop. At night, up-lit glass elements will release a glow with the dome of the Capitol visible, a choice the designers of the memorial made to pay homage to the role of journalism in democracy, the foundation said on its website.\nWhile a list of names will exist digitally, unlike many D.C. tributes, there will not be any on Fallen Journalists Memorial.\n“Because sadly,” Cochran said, “This is an unfinished story.”"

    "title": "Trump’s mass deportations could hit Maryland economy, experts warn",
    "content": "WASHINGTON — Throughout his campaign for a second term, President-elect Donald Trump promised his administration would carry out the largest mass deportation operation in American history.\nIf successful, Trump’s move would put the estimated more than a quarter-million Maryland residents without legal status at risk of deportation, which experts say could damage the state’s economy long-term.\n“(This policy) is a very real worry,” Benjamin Orr, the president and CEO of the nonpartisan Maryland Center on Economic Policy, told Capital News Service. ”It’s going to have terrible impacts on families, and its also going to really slow down and harm our states economy.”\nWillow Lung-Amam, an associate professor in the University of Maryland’s urban studies and planning program and a director of its Urban Equity Collaborative, takes her class on a walking tour through Langley Park each year. It’s only a square mile, and the latest U.S. Census data indicates that 83 percent of its 22,000 residents are Hispanic — many of whom are living there without legal permission.\nDuring Trump’s first term, Langley Park lived in fear of ICE raids.\nIn June 2019, Trump promised to carry out large-scale mass deportations. ICE removed more than 250,000 people the previous year, 55 percent of which were convicted of felonies or misdemeanors, according to the agency.\nThe result in Langley Park was widespread panic, largely empty streets and residents hesitant to leave their homes, according to a CBS report from July 2019.\nWith the president-elect declaring even more drastic measures during his second term, Lung-Amam worries for areas with large migrant populations.\n“What I fear for communities like Langley Park are not just the level of deportations … but the larger sense that that community doesnt matter, or that the people in it dont matter,” Lung-Amam said.\nImmigrants without legal status represent 4.2 percent of Maryland’s overall population and nearly a quarter of Maryland’s immigration population, according to the American Immigration Council, a Washington-based nonprofit advocacy group.\nNearly 150,000 individuals without legal status are employed in Maryland, according to a 2019 report by the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank in Washington. More than a quarter of this population works in construction; 17 percent in professional, scientific, management, administrative, and waste management services; and 15 percent in accommodation and food services, entertainment and recreation.\n!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r=0;r\nPeople living in the country without legal permission paid more than $1.2 billion in taxes, including $476.3 million in state and local taxes, and $4.3 billion in total spending power in 2022, according to the American Immigration Council.\n“Unauthorized immigrants, over their lifetimes, contribute far more in terms of tax payments and productivity than they cost,” Michelle Mittelstadt, the director of communications for the Migration Policy Institute, said.\nLast month, Gov. Wes Moore told The Baltimore Banner that he is grateful for immigrants communities’ contributions to the state and is committed to protecting all Marylanders, regardless of “the actions the new administration takes on immigration policy.”\nThe United States historically has expelled the majority of migrants without legal status to Mexico and other Central American countries. And with the majority of those living in Maryland without legal permission hailing from those nations, according to the Migration Policy Institute, Mittelstadt said the state could see a larger number of deported people in Trump’s second term.\n!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r=0;r\nThe nation has experienced several mass deportation episodes in the past. Most recently, nearly 454,000 migrants living in the country without legal permission were deported between 2008 and 2014, according to a study by Robert Lynch, an economics professor at Washington College in Chestertown, Maryland.\n“In each of these episodes, politicians and proponents of the deportations asserted that the policy would create jobs for American workers, raise their wages and grow the economy,” Lynch said on a Nov. 20 virtual press call. “But in each case, jobs for American workers did not materialize, their wages did not go up and the economy did not grow.”\nOne of the modern examples of mass deportations within the United States centered around Arizona, where anti-immigration laws resulted in the state losing an estimated 40 percent of its workers living in the country without legal status between 2008 and 2015. While a national recession at the same time resulted in immigrants leaving several states, a study co-authored by Lynch in July found that Arizona had the greatest decline in its migrant population.\nIn the aftermath of its policies, Arizona saw a 2.5 percent decrease in total employment due to the departures, according to a Moody’s Analytics analysis, and American-born, non-Hispanic white men in the state saw a 2 percent decline in employment rates.\nIn his first term, Trump cut refugee admissions to historic levels, enacted a Muslim travel ban and made it more difficult for immigrants of all statuses to enter the country.\nNotably for Maryland, Trump changed the H-2B visa program, a seasonal visa for foreign workers, from first-come, first-served to a lottery system, which hurt the Maryland crabbing industry.\n“Women, particularly from Mexico, have come to Maryland during the crab-picking season to work and do these jobs,” Mittelstadt said. “These are not considered high-skill jobs. However, it does take a very particular skill to do them.”\nIn August 2018, the Washington Post reported that about a third of crab-picking jobs were vacant across the Eastern Shore.\nLynch argues that large-scale mass deportations only hurt the local and federal economies, partially due to the misnomer that deporting working immigrants creates more jobs for Americans.\n“The idea that mass deportation will help American citizens in the future is likely an illusion,” Lynch said during the press call, rejecting the notion that immigrants living in the United States without legal permission are doing the jobs American workers otherwise would do.\n“(Those living in the country without legal status) have different skills, different abilities to work, different willingness to work,” Lynch said. “They are often not in competition with American workers but they work cooperatively, increasing each other’s productivity and wages, creating more jobs and growing the economy for everyone.”\nAs many as 28 million Americans will be in families with at least one member without legal status by the beginning of 2025, according to a report from FWD.us, a bipartisan political organization advocating immigration and criminal justice reforms.\nIn Maryland, 84,000 immigrants without legal status are married and 51,000 of them are married to non-U.S. citizens or legal permanent residents, according to the Migration Policy Institute.\nOrr worries that Maryland may see a decline in consumers’ spending in anticipation of Trump’s second term, which may combine the mass deportation of immigrants without legal documentation to live in the country with a dramatic slash to the federal government, which is the largest single employer in the state.\n“It will be a shock both morally and ethically,” Orr said. “A shock to families and communities and a shock to our economy that will be very difficult to recover from.”"

    "title": "Biden asks for aid for Baltimore’s Key Bridge rebuild in disaster package",
    "content": "WASHINGTON – Hours after Baltimore’s Francis Scott Key Bridge collapsed last March, President Joe Biden pledged that the federal government would pay for the entire replacement. The president and Congress are now attempting to fulfill that promise.\nBiden sent a letter Monday to House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-Louisiana, asking him for a $98 billion supplemental spending package for emergency disaster relief.\nThe proposed spending would help reimburse agencies that are working on recovery from the Key Bridge collapse, Hurricanes Milton and Hurricane Helene and other recent disasters.\nLawmakers on Capitol Hill – including Maryland Democratic Reps. Steny Hoyer and Jamie Raskin –  are optimistic that some form of disaster funding will pass before the end of this Congress, targeted to end on Dec. 20.\n“Hopefully were going to move forward with the presidents disaster relief, which I think on a bipartisan basis, people are concerned about it because Republicans and Democrats have both seen their populations experience loss,” Hoyer told Capital News Service Tuesday.\nWhile Johnson has not specified the amount of disaster funding he would be willing to approve, he did express an openness to sending aid to areas impacted by the hurricanes.\n“Were going to continue to provide for the American people with resources that are desperately needed,” Johnson said during a Tuesday news conference.\nCongress passed a disaster relief bill in 2022, but has not approved additional disaster aid despite repeated requests from the Biden administration.\n“Disasters are not red or blue or Democrat or Republican, but they affect all Americans,” Raskin told CNS Tuesday. “That would be a real dereliction of duty if we didnt do it.”\nThe Key Bridge collapsed into the Patapsco River on March 26 after a large container ship crashed into a support column. Six construction workers who were on the bridge were killed.\nThe collapse closed the Port of Baltimore for over 11 weeks.\nCurrently, 90% of the recovery and rebuilding of the Key Bridge is being paid for through the Federal Highway Administration’s emergency fund. The Maryland delegation and Biden have pushed for the federal government to pay for 100% of the rebuilding, which requires congressional approval.\nThat 100% funding could come through Biden’s proposed package.\nThe president’s request sets aside over $100 million specifically to replenish funds after the Key Bridge collapse. This includes $79.5 million for the U.S. Coast Guard to cover unplanned costs associated with its response to the bridge collapse and $33 million for the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to replenish funds used to remove bridge wreckage from the water and reopen the shipping channel.\nThe Key Bridge would also get portions of the $8 billion for the Department of Transportation’s emergency relief program and the $150 million set aside for the Department of Labor’s training and employment service.\nUntil the current Congress ends next month, Maryland has four lawmakers on the House Appropriations Committee and one member on the Senate Appropriations Committee – the two panels that determine the size of spending bills.\nThere has been pushback from some lawmakers over whether the bridge should be funded totally by the federal government because the bridge collapse was caused by a ship and not by a natural disaster.\nThe Senate committee held a hearing Wednesday, where Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg testified in support of the disaster relief package, including for the Key Bridge.\n“…The destruction of the Key Bridge,” Buttigieg said, was “something that is of not just local or regional but national significance when you consider its impact on supply chains.”\n“This is something that happened through no fault of the communities that were directly impacted,” he said.\nBiden’s plans also indicate that if the Corps of Engineers receives funds from the recent settlement agreement between the Department of Justice and the corporations that own and operate the container ship that hit the bridge, the funding would not be necessary.\nRep. Andy Harris, R-Maryland, told CNS Wednesday that he will have to see where the proposal goes to commit to voting on it.\nHarris is the new chairman of the House Freedom Caucus, which generally advocates lower government spending. But the Republican in the past has been a supporter of Key Bridge funding efforts."

    "title": "Trump&#8217;s Kennedy nomination casts long shadow over NIH",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  The director of the National Institutes of Health fielded pointed questions from House Republicans in a hearing Tuesday regarding how the agency would rebuild public trust and spend its nearly $50 billion budget.\n“One of our top priorities is to earn back trust lost during COVID. We need to better communicate information about the research we do and how it benefits all Americans,” Dr. Monica Bertagnolli, who has helmed NIH since last November, told members of the House Appropriations Committee.\nNIH is under particular scrutiny following President-elect Donald Trump’s announcement Thursday that he would nominate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as secretary of health and human services, whose department includes NIH.\nThe nation’s medical research agency, NIH is headquartered in Bethesda, Maryland, and employs more than 18,700 federal staff.\nIn Kennedy’s unsuccessful 2024 presidential run under the banner “Make America Healthy Again,” he repeatedly spread misinformation about vaccine research, including casting aspersions on how vaccine trials were conducted during the pandemic. NIH funds vaccine research, including the mRNA sequencing used to develop the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine.\nDespite a warning from presiding Rep. Robert Aderholt, R-Alabama, not to wade into controversial issues in Tuesday’s hearing, Republican Rep. Andy Harris of Maryland grilled Bertagnolli on how NIH grantees report the gender of clinical trial participants who do not identify with their biological sex.\nWhen Bertagnolli replied that the answer depends on the research question at hand, Harris said, “And that’s why nobody trusts the NIH anymore.”\nHarris said that despite budget increases for NIH, America is “getting sicker, not healthier.”\n“Whatever we’re doing, it’s just not working,” Harris said. “And there’s a reason why, you know, Mr. Kennedy and Mr. (Elon) Musk are gonna have a say in this.”\nDemocratic Rep. Steny Hoyer of Maryland approached the subject of NIH accountability with a lighter touch, asking Bertagnolli whether directors of NIH’s largest institutes and centers would testify before the committee to account for their work in greater detail, to which Bertagnolli agreed.\nDemocratic Sen. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland told Capital News Service in a statement he will oppose Kennedy’s confirmation in the Senate, where Republicans will soon hold the majority with 53 seats.\nKennedy, if confirmed, would appoint an acting director of NIH to replace Bertagnolli. The Senate later would confirm a permanent head of the agency.\nIn a Nov. 9 interview with entrepreneur Joe Polish in Scottsdale, Arizona, Kennedy said he would fire and replace 600 NIH personnel on the first day of Trump’s second term.\nVan Hollen said Kennedy’s threats to HHS agencies are deeply concerning, and Kennedy’s “promotion of anti-vaccine conspiracy theories and lack of expertise makes him unfit to lead this critical institution.”\nKennedy’s appointment is an initial step towards realizing the conservative vision for public health laid out in the Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025 roadmap for a second Trump term.\nProject 2025 names NIH and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as “the duo most responsible — along with President Joe Biden — for the irrational, destructive, un-American mask and vaccine mandates that were imposed upon an ostensibly free people during the COVID-19 pandemic.”\nThe pandemic eroded the public’s trust in scientists, particularly among Republicans, according to a Pew Research Center survey published Thursday. That distrust was a recurring theme of the committee hearing Tuesday, where Republican lawmakers probed the NIH director more aggressively than their Democratic counterparts.\nYet despite skepticism in the halls of power, Pew’s polling signals a warming in conservative sentiment towards scientists. Republicans’ overall trust in scientists is up 5 percent over last year, the first positive gain since the start of the pandemic.\nWhile there is broad support from the public and in Congress to fund scientific research writ large, several Republican lawmakers have proposed frameworks to reform operations at NIH.\nIn June, Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, R-Washington, introduced a proposal to consolidate NIH’s 27 institutes and centers to 15 bodies. Rodgers also raised concerns over the “stagnant nature of leadership” at NIH, citing Dr. Anthony Fauci’s 38 years as director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.\nBertagnolli told lawmakers Tuesday that NIH’s many centers work collaboratively and serve as “visible representations of certain disease groups and constituencies.” The National Institute on Aging, for example, is an important touchstone to those concerned about Alzheimer’s disease, Bertagnolli said.\nHoyer told CNS that examining NIH’s structure is “a worthwhile objective” but one that should not be rushed through Congress.\nCaleb Watney, the Co-CEO at the Institute for Progress, a think tank focused on technology and science innovation policy, told CNS that should the Trump administration enact reform at NIH, the change is likely to be small and incremental.\nThe Republican-controlled Congress may pass some restrictions like term limits for directors, but major cuts to grant funding are less likely, Watney predicted.\n“I would be surprised if there is large-scale, across-the-board NIH cuts, especially because…their fundamental mission is so bipartisan,” Watney said.\nIn May, Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-Louisiana, released a white paper scrutinizing NIH’s grant management process, including the peer-review process required before grant funding is approved.\nThe peer review system can take months or even years, a pace that itself is “a huge cost to science,” according to Watney.\nWatney said that the new Congress should not take the public’s frustration with the federal COVID response, which was largely led by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as a blank check to erroneously gut science research at NIH.\n“I hope that our policy makers are being careful about applying the scalpel to the right institution, because its not going to fix everything if you slash and burn the NIH,” Watney said.\n!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r=0;r\nTrump attempted to curb the NIH budget in every annual spending proposal of his first term. Despite those efforts, Congress increased research spending year over year.\nNIH’s Fiscal Year 2024 budget is nearly $48 billion, roughly 80% of which passes through to grantees at research organizations across the country.\nNIH grants in Maryland total over $1.4 billion this year. Johns Hopkins University is the largest grant recipient in the state, receiving more funding than all others combined.\nThe largest grant awarded to Johns Hopkins supports the National Health and Aging Trends Study and the National Study of Caregiving. Nearly $17.5 million in federal support assists researchers studying Alzheimer’s disease, dementia and other late-life disabilities.\nWhen asked whether NIH employees or grantees in Maryland should be concerned about a coming shakeup in the agency, Harris told CNS: “That will be up to the secretary (of HHS).”"

    "title": "Senate panel OKs measure aimed at luring Washington Commanders from Maryland to DC",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  A bill that would transfer control of the Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium land from the federal government to the District of Columbia passed a hurdle in the Senate on Tuesday.\nThe Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee voted 17-2 to advance the bill, which still needs approval from the full Senate. The legislation could help bring the NFL’s Washington Commanders back to the nation’s capital, but some Maryland lawmakers are opposed to the bill.\nThe team currently plays in Northwest Stadium in Landover, Maryland.\n“For the capital city of the United States of America, it’s only befitting that we do this,” Sen. Joe Manchin, I-West Virginia, and chairman of the committee, said. “All we’re doing is basically completing a multifaceted approach to fixing this property and making it something we can all be proud of.”\nThe House overwhelmingly passed the bill in February by a vote of 348-55. All of Maryland’s representatives either voted against or did not vote on the legislation.\n“Like other members of the Maryland delegation, I believe Prince George’s County in Maryland should be able to compete on a level playing field to keep the Washington Commanders,” Rep. Glenn Ivey, D-Maryland, said on the House floor ahead of the vote in February. “This bill transfers control over federal government property at no apparent cost to the District of Columbia.”\nMany Maryland lawmakers, including Ivey, hope to keep the Washington Commanders’ stadium in Prince George’s County. The team has played there since 1997. The stadium was ranked by The Athletic in 2023 as one of the worst NFL venues.\nMaryland Gov. Wes Moore told Capital News Service last spring that local officials are putting together a strong deal to encourage the Commanders to stay in Maryland. These efforts include constructing a new stadium in Landover and investing in the area.\nMoore said in a statement to Capital News Service on Tuesday that Maryland is continuing to make its case that the team should stay in the state.\n“When the Commanders moved to Prince George’s County in the 90s, they bought the land where they built the stadium from the government at around fair market value. I don’t see why they shouldn’t play by the same rules now,” Moore said. “The RFK bill as currently written could let the Commanders essentially develop this land for free.”\nSen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Maryland, said Maryland has served as the proud home of the Commanders for more than 20 years and that he wants to make sure the process of choosing a new stadium is fair.\n“Our priority is not to block the transfer of the RFK property from the National Park Service to the District of Columbia, but to ensure a fair process in the selection of a Commanders stadium site and prevent actions that unfairly tilt the scales in favor of one location over another at the expense of federal taxpayers,” Van Hollen said in a statement to CNS on Tuesday.\nThe RFK Stadium was home to the then-Washington Redskins from 1961 through 1996. The stadium also was home to the Washington Senators baseball team until 1971, and, more recently, Major League Soccer’s D.C. United and the Washington Nationals. The stadium is currently vacant and is set to be demolished.\nThe bill would allow the District of Columbia to redevelop the land, which currently belongs to the National Park Service, for a new stadium or other purposes.\n“Today’s vote marks a pivotal moment in our efforts to unlock the potential of the RFK Campus by transforming this underutilized space into a vibrant hub of affordable housing, world-class recreational facilities, green spaces, and economic opportunity for District residents and visitors alike,” Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser said in a statement Tuesday. “We look forward to a full vote on the Senate floor so we can get it signed into law before year’s end.”\nBowser supports the Commanders moving back to the district and has discussed the matter with Josh Harris, the team’s owner. Harris has previously expressed interest in moving the Commanders to a new stadium at the RFK site and has been advocating for the bill’s passage.\n“Let’s go Commanders,” Manchin said after the panels votes had been counted."

    "title": "Senate panel passes bill making Chesapeake National Recreation Area a national park unit",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  The Chesapeake Bay area is one step closer to becoming part of the national parks system.\nThe Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee on Tuesday passed the Chesapeake Bay National Recreation Area Act, moving it onto the Senate floor.\nThe measure, sponsored by Maryland Democratic Sen. Chris Van Hollen, would create the Chesapeake National Recreation Area in Maryland and Virginia and make it part of a network of sites overseen by the National Park Service.\n“In Maryland, we know the Chesapeake Bay is a national treasure,” Van Hollen said in a statement. “And creating the Chesapeake National Recreation Area will celebrate that fact while also bringing major benefits to the Bay.”\n“Not only will this open up more equitable public access to the Bay, the (Chesapeake National Recreation Act) will also mobilize additional federal support for restoration, shine a light on the untold stories of its history, and support greater economic opportunity in the region,” the senator said.\nOne of the key goals of making the Chesapeake National Recreation Area part of the national parks system is to boost national pride in the bay and its history, amplifying the stories of historically underrepresented groups such as Indigenous and Black people.\n“Today’s bipartisan, unanimous vote was a big step forward in our efforts to pass this historic legislation,” Van Hollen said.\nIn 2021, Van Hollen and Maryland Rep. John Sarbanes, a Democrat, created a working group to help draft the language for the legislation. The working group included Maryland Sen. Ben Cardin, a Democrat, Virginia Democratic Sens. Mark Warner and Tim Kaine, and Reps. Bobby Scott, D-Virginia, Rob Wittman, R-Virginia, and various conservation groups. Van Hollen and Sarbanes introduced the measure in the Senate and House, respectively, last year. However, the idea of the Chesapeake National Recreation Area dates as far back as the 1980s.\n“The Chesapeake Bay is an extraordinary national treasure and a vital resource for our region,” Sarbanes said in a statement. “I am thrilled that the Chesapeake National Recreation Area Act has advanced out of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee – a crucial milestone in our efforts to safeguard the Bay for the well-being and enjoyment of future generations.”\nSince the measure’s introduction, several interested parties have submitted letters to Van Hollen in support of the legislation, including Rep.-elect John “Johnny O” Olszewski, Jr., Annapolis Mayor Gavin Buckley and Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott.\n“Thanks to Senator Van Hollen’s leadership, this is a great day for the Chesapeake Bay, with another step forward in the four-decade effort to establish National Park Service recognition for the nation’s largest estuary,” Chesapeake Conservancy President and CEO Joel Dunn said in a statement. “The Chesapeake Bay is as spectacular as Yellowstone or Yosemite, as great as the Great Smokies and as grand as the Grand Tetons.”\nThe Chesapeake Recreation Area Act would make the park service take on a larger and more administrative role.\nCurrently, the National Park Service can partner with and provide assistance to local and regional organizations involved in the bay through the Chesapeake Gateways program and administers some sites along the watershed, including some national monument sites.\nIf the legislation is enacted, the park service would administer the Chesapeake Gateways and Watertrails Network, which encompasses about 200 places located within the Chesapeake Bay watershed.\nHowever, the bill states that the Department of the Interior, through the National Park Service, would only acquire land and land-based resources within the recreation area boundaries from voluntary transfers by landowners. The bill also specifically states that the park service has to work with the Department of Transportation to minimize traffic around the bay as well as create an advisory board made up of nine representatives each from Maryland and Virginia.\nThe management and acquisition of sites would come from the park service’s annual budget under the Department of the Interior, which is approved by Congress.\n“Establishing the Chesapeake National Recreation Area expands resources for environmental protection and makes it clear that the United States cherishes the Chesapeake, the birthplace of American identity,” Dunn said. “As a great gift to future generations, this legislation ensures public access to our nation’s largest estuary while providing for the needs of those who live here and depend on the Bay for their livelihood.”"

Jamie Raskin and Kweisi Mfume are among nearly 90 congressional Democrats urging President Joe Biden to sanction two top Israeli government officials.\n“With radical officials in the Netanyahu government continuing to enable settler violence and enact annexationist policies, it is clear that further sanctions are urgently needed,” said the October letter, made public Thursday.\nSigned by 71 House members and 17 senators, the letter asks Biden to sanction Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Givir.\nThe lawmakers accused the men of destabilizing the West Bank by promoting settler violence, weakening the Palestinian Authority and facilitating the annexation of the West Bank by Israel.\n“Government leaders instigating violence must be subject to U.S. sanctions; those in leadership responsible for the lawlessness must be held to account,” the letter said.\nThe Democrats sent the letter before the presidential election, on Oct. 29, and made the letter public after not receiving a response from the White House.\nThe letter came after British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said that he was considering sanctioning the two men.\n“The administration has been sanctioning officials for inflaming tensions and violence in the West Bank, and this would be completely consistent with the policy that the administration has been engaged in,” Raskin told CNS Thursday.\nBiden signed an executive order in February that allows any person designated by the secretary of state as responsible for or complicit in actions that “threaten the peace, security, or stability of the West Bank” to be sanctioned.\nThe administration has since sanctioned several Israeli settlers in the West Bank who have committed violence against Palestinians, their respective outposts, and the Israeli extremist group Tzav 9, which had blocked humanitarian aid into Gaza. Under the same executive order, the administration sanctioned the Palestinian militant group known as Lions’ Den.\nThe lawmakers’ letter also urged the administration to sanction other people and entities that meet the criteria laid out by Biden’s earlier executive order.\nOne such entity explicitly mentioned in the letter was Amana, an organization that the lawmakers said had played a key role in establishing Israeli West Bank settlements. Regavim, a non-governmental organization that attempts to block Palestinian construction in the West Bank, was also mentioned in the letter as an entity that should be sanctioned.\nThe October letter followed a May letter —  signed by Sen. Ben Cardin, D-Maryland, and others and sent to Secretary of State Antony Blinker and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen – that urged the administration to target all bad actors equally and to enforce sanctions already in place."

    "title": "Trump&#8217;s pledge to &#8216;drain the swamp&#8217; risks thousands of Maryland federal jobs",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  Thousands of federal jobs in Maryland could be at risk under President-elect Donald Trump’s plan to reclassify scores of civil servants as political appointees starting on day one of his second term.\n“I will shatter the Deep State, and restore government that is controlled by the People,” Trump said on his campaigns website, citing corruption, poor performance and leaks as the reasons he wanted to institute changes.\nThere are more than 60 federal facilities in Maryland, including agencies that Trump either directly threatened on the campaign trail or slashed in his first term.\nMontgomery County Executive Marc Elrich signaled in a press conference Wednesday that if residents who work for the government lose jobs, the move could deal a blow to the local economy.\n“The defunding of some federal agencies and the possible movement of other agencies out of the D.C. area brings a serious threat of reduced revenue from displaced federal employees,” Elrich said. “This is a very real threat.”\nRetiring Rep. John Sarbanes, D-Maryland, said in a statement Friday that “Maryland’s federal employees ensure the successful operation of critical government programs and services that all Americans rely on.\nAny attempt to reinstate Schedule F would threaten the job security, benefits and critical workplace protections for the thousands of dedicated nonpartisan civil servants who work hard every day on behalf of all our communities, the congressman said.\nMore than 150,000 Marylanders worked in the federal government last year, representing nearly six percent of the state’s total workforce. After the District of Columbia, California and Virginia, Maryland ranks fourth in the nation for the largest number of federal employees.\n“Federal employees are sworn to uphold the law and the Constitution, and they will continue to do their jobs regardless of who sits in the White House,” Everett Kelley, president of the American Federation of Government Employees, said in a statement Wednesday.\n“But make no mistake: our union will not stand by and let any political leader – regardless of their political affiliation – run roughshod over the Constitution and our laws,” Kelley said. AFGE represents more than 800,000 federal and District of Columbia government workers.\nTrump plans to root out what he has called “rogue bureaucrats” by culling swaths of federal employees in nonpolitical civil service roles, also known as the competitive service, who do not turn over with the White House. He could achieve this by reclassifying their posts as political appointments, which would empower his administration to terminate those employees at will.\nThis news may feel like déjà vu for federal employees. Trump made an effort late in his first term to make more federal employees subject to presidential appointments.\nIn an October 2020 executive order, Trump created a new class of federal employee called Schedule F, for “positions of a confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating character not normally subject to change as a result of a Presidential transition.”\nAfter Trump issued the order, Sarbanes and fellow Maryland Democratic Reps. Steny Hoyer, David Trone and Jamie Raskin, along with nine other members of Congress, sent a letter to the House Appropriations Committee warning that Schedule F “could precipitate an exodus from the federal government, leaving federal agencies without deep institutional knowledge, expertise, experience, and the ability to develop and implement long-term policy strategies.”\nPresident Joe Biden revoked Trump’s order on his third day in office in 2021, saying in a statement that it “not only was unnecessary to the conditions of good administration, but also undermined the foundations of the civil service and its merit system principles.”\nAs Trump reiterated his call to “drain the swamp” on the campaign trail this year, the Biden administration took further steps to protect employees against the prospect of a second Trump term.\nIn April, the Office of Personnel Management issued a rule to further enshrine protections for career government employees, including a process to appeal involuntary transfers into political appointments.\nIn his second term, Trump can reverse this rule in as few as 60 days, following a period of public comment. He may also have a path to invalidate the current rule through the courts or congressional action.\n“I think the most likely thing is that it would be put into effect andthen the real battles would begin,” said Donald Kettl, professor emeritus and former dean of the University of Marylands School of Public Policy. He said that battles in court and influencing public opinion would be the only real recourses in pushing back against the executive order.\n“This is the kind of thing that deserves an enormous amount of attention,” Kettl said. “It seems like kind of inside baseball nuts and bolts, but it turns out to be fundamental to almost everything else that the new administration is going to want.”\nSarbanes urged his congressional colleagues to draft legislation  similar to what he co-sponsored last year with Hoyer, Trone, Raskin, Rep. Kweisi Mfume, D-Maryland, and others  to strengthen protections for federal employees and take all measures necessary to prevent the politicization or undermining of the civil service. Our federal employees deserve stability and respect for their critical work.”\nThe reinstatement of Schedule F in 2025 could reclassify the jobs of up to 50,000 career officials, according to Don Moynihan, a professor of public policy at the University of Michigans Gerald R. Ford School of Public Policy.\nThose at most risk are employees of agencies like the Department of Education that Trump perceives as left-leaning, Moynihan wrote in a Nov. 7 Substack post.\nMoynihan predicted that the White House could first strategically fire several thousand newly classified Schedule F employees to intimidate the remaining workers into submission, a strategy he called “heads on pikes.”"

    "title": "Democrat McClain Delaney declares victory in Maryland’s 6th District House race",
    "content": "Editors note: This story has been updated.\nGERMANTOWN, Md. – Three days after polls closed on Election Day, Democrat April McClain Delaney on Friday declared victory over Republican Neil Parrott in Maryland’s 6th Congressional District race.\nI am deeply honored and humbled by the trust the people of Marylands 6th District have placed in me, McClain Delaney said in a statement. Since the beginning of this campaign, our message has been clear: its time for common sense, common ground leadership that puts people over politics, defends our freedoms and values, and builds a future centered on unity.\nDecision Desk HQ, which projects election outcomes, called the 6th District for McClain Delaney at 9:50 p.m. Thursday as the day’s tallies came in. CNN and NBC also have called the race for the Democrat. However, the Associated Press had yet to declare a winner as of Friday afternoon.\nThe AP called the races for the other seven congressional districts in Maryland by 10:19 p.m. on election night.\nParrott did not concede Friday, issuing a statement saying: I want everyone to know that I am extremely grateful for the huge amount of work that was put into this campaign by volunteers in all five counties. As a result of this effort and sacrifice, the Parrott Campaign will wait until all the votes are counted before declaring victory or defeat.\nThe 6th District race was a rare phenomenon in Maryland: a competitive contest. That was clear as results came in Tuesday night showing McClain Delaney and Parrott in a neck-and-neck struggle. When counties across the state resumed canvassing additional mail-in votes on Thursday morning, the gap between the two candidates was tight – separated by just over 300 votes.\nBut by Friday afternoon, McClain Delaney’s lead jumped to nearly 10,000 – winning 51.18% of counted ballots to Parrott’s 48.61%.\nWith the results of several congressional contests still outstanding, the outcome of the 6th District race will help determine whether the Democrats or the Republicans will control the House. The GOP is set to control the Senate and the White House, making the House the last remaining obstacle to a Republican trifecta.\nThe 6th District – which stretches from rural Western Maryland to the Montgomery County suburbs – has been represented by a Democrat since 2013.\nMcClain Delaney and Parrott fought to replace Rep. David Trone, D-Maryland, who opened up the seat to run unsuccessfully in the Senate primary.\nCounties in Maryland stopped tabulating ballots Wednesday but resumed counting mail-in ballots Thursday morning. Those ballots could be postmarked or dropped in ballot drop boxes by 8 p.m. on Election Day, and can be received as late as 10 a.m. on Nov. 15. Counties begin counting provisional ballots – votes that require additional verification before being counted –  on Nov. 13, according to a State Board of Elections schedule.\nThousands of mail-in ballots and provisional ballots remain to be counted. As of Friday afternoon, McClain Delaney was leading mail-in ballots already counted across the district with nearly 72% of counted mail-ins.\nMatthew Klein, U.S. House and governors analyst at the nonpartisan Cook Political Report, said on Wednesday that he anticipated late vote counts from mail-in ballots would continue to swing towards McClain Delaney and secure her the seat.\nOver 55% of all mail-in ballots in the 6th District were requested by registered Democrats, compared to about 23% by Republicans and 22% by unaffiliated and third-party voters, according to data from the State Board of Elections.\n\nAbout three out of four mail-in ballots requested in the 6th District for this year’s election were in Frederick and Montgomery counties, where the AP estimated the largest number of uncounted ballots remain – and most of those requests were from registered Democrats.\nDelaney’s mail-in advantage was strongest in Montgomery County – which lies partially within the 6th District’s boundaries – where over 62% of mail-in ballots in the district were requested by Democrats compared to just over 13% by Republicans.\nBy 6:00 p.m. Thursday evening, over 140,000 mail-in ballots across Montgomery County had been received from voters and nearly 80,000 had been counted, according to data from the State Board of Elections.\n\nGilberto Zelaya,  community engagement and public relations officer for the Montgomery County Board of Elections, said late Thursday evening that the county counted over 13,000 additional mail-in ballots that day – though not all of those ballots were from voters in the 6th District.\nThe county’s next canvass is scheduled for Saturday.\nBefore Thursday, Frederick County had already counted 15,000 ballots and had an additional 20,000 ready to be counted, Barbara Wagner, the county’s election director, told CNS on Thursday.\nFrederick County had about 5,000 provisional ballots left to count, Wagner said.\nWagner said the county board of elections expects to hit its deadline to finalize vote counts by Nov. 15. Zelaya wasn’t sure if the same could be said about Montgomery County, which he said usually requests extensions.\nMaryland’s State Board of Elections also released a statement on Friday warning that “due to the high volume of mail-in ballots and a historic number of provisional ballots, certification by the local board of canvassers may not be achieved by November 15.”\nElection officials noted that even if news organizations call the race for one candidate as additional tallies come in, all eligible votes will be counted – and officials won’t declare a winner until then."

    "title": "Maryland lawmakers optimistic about local projects under second Trump term",
    "content": "WASHINGTON – After Tuesdays defeat of Vice President Kamala Harris and a flip of the majority in the United States Senate to the Republicans, Democratic lawmakers in Maryland say they are still optimistic about the prospects of several key state projects that would require congressional and presidential support to move forward.\nThe delegation’s priority projects include reconstructing Baltimore’s Francis Scott Key Bridge, maintaining the environmental cleanup of the Chesapeake Bay and relocating the FBI headquarters from Pennsylvania Avenue to a 61-acre site in Greenbelt, Maryland.\n“Id say we’re still optimistic,” Rep. Glenn Ivey, D-Maryland, told Capital News Service the day after winning a second term in Congress. “We know that (these projects are) not a done deal, and were going to have to keep working to move (them) forward.”\nIvey said he was confident, especially regarding the Key Bridge, that Congress will overcome partisan politics to address the effects of the disaster. He pointed to recovery efforts after the twin hurricanes Helene and Milton that swept through much of the GOP-supporting Southeast in October as a model for bipartisan cooperation.\n“I would think that thered be a coming together to make sure that Congress helps out those who are in need due to these kinds of disasters, and that we dont play politics with each other,” Ivey said.\nSen. Chris Van Hollen, a Democrat, reiterated many of Ivey’s sentiments in an email to CNS. He said he was committed to working alongside Democratic Sen. Ben Cardin, who is retiring in January, to provide the necessary funding to replace the Key Bridge as soon as possible.\nIn an interview with CNS, Cardin said there is bipartisan support for rebuilding the Key Bridge, but that Congress needs legislation to attach the funds to.\n“We’re not panicked about getting it done. We’ll get it done,” said Cardin.\nDuring Donald Trump’s first term as president, he made an annual tradition of trying to slash funding for cleaning up the Chesapeake Bay.\nVan Hollen promised that Maryland’s delegation would work tirelessly for its constituents, even under the returning Trump.\n“Regardless of who is in the White House, Team Maryland fights tooth and nail to deliver for our state — be that for the Chesapeake Bay, the FBI Headquarters, the Red Line or the many other projects that we’re working on,” Van Hollen said.\nIn his 2021 budget proposal, for example, Trump proposed a 91 percent reduction in funding for Chesapeake Bay restoration, cutting the budget from $85 million to $7.3 million. Congress instead agreed to add an extra $2.5 million to the Chesapeake Bay Program nine months after the request.\n“During the Donald Trump years, he tried to zero out the program, and yet we were able not only to maintain the funding, but increase the authorization of funding while President Trump was in office,” Cardin said. “We have bipartisan support from the Chesapeake Bay program in the appropriation process, and I have no reason to believe that wont continue into the next Congress.”\nCardin told CNS that Chesapeake Bay restoration is set to be funded at a record level in the next fiscal year. While this year’s appropriation bills have yet to be passed, Cardin said he expects more than $90 million to be dedicated to the Chesapeake Bay.\nRep. Andy Harris, Maryland’s sole Republican representative in Congress, supported Trump’s campaign and said on Newsmax Thursday that Americans elected Trump because they agree with his plans to secure the southern border and reduce inflation.\n“These are the issues that resonated with broad swaths of the American public, including record numbers of minorities,” the chairman of the House Freedom Caucus said.\nElection night was filled with victories for Maryland Democrats.\nKamala Harris won the state, marking the ninth consecutive time Maryland voters backed the Democratic nominee for president. Prince George’s County Executive Angela Alsobrooks became the first Black woman from the state elected to the Senate. However, Trump’s win soured the historic night for some lawmakers.\nVan Hollen said in a Wednesday statement that despite feeling “heartened by the history Maryland made,” he was “deeply disappointed and disheartened by the results of this election.”\nIvey, who defeated Republican challenger George McDermott to keep his 4th Congressional District seat Tuesday, said he was “thankful to be re-elected, but it was a very tough night overall.”\nSarah Elfreth, who was elected to represent Maryland’s 3rd Congressional District in Congress, said in a social media post that while it was a “dark day nationally,” there are wins to be celebrated in Maryland. She referenced the state enshrining abortion rights in its constitution, Alsobrooks’ victory and her own win.\n“While my heart is broken that Vice President Harris did not win, I’m proud of the race she ran, the values she championed, and our commitment to accepting the results of this election,” Elfreth said.\nCardin called the outcome “a gut punch of sorts” in a statement. As he approaches retirement, Cardin said he remains hopeful in the state he has represented on Capitol Hill since 1987.\n“Its going to be a rough go at it under the Trump administration, but Im confident,” Cardin said. “We will figure out a strategy to deal with it.”"

    "title": "Live from New York! It’s Saturday night politics!",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  NBC’s “Saturday Night Live” has been an integral part of the fabric of late-night television for half a century and a consistent creator of classic political satire.\nBetween a stumbling Gerald Ford, coining George W. Bushs “strategery” and nearly a decade of viral Donald Trump impersonations, the sketch variety show, which typically earns increased attention during presidential election years, has manufactured moments that have stood the test of time and may have influenced elections.\n“[“SNL”] has become an institution,” William Horner, author of “Saturday Night Live and the 1976 Presidential Election” and a University of Missouri political science professor, said. “They have generated the expectation that they’re going to engage in campaigns, so everybody wants to see what they do.”\nThis year has been no exception, as “SNL” has caricatured President Joe Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris, Trump, GOP vice presidential candidate JD Vance and Democratic vice presidential hopeful Tim Walz.\n“There really is a focus with SNL, more than other comedy shows, on getting the impersonation right—making sure youve got the right cadence and appearance and really mimicking gestures and things like that,” said Amy Becker, a professor in the Department of Communication and Media at Loyola University Maryland who studies the impact of political comedy.\nThis season’s political skewering builds on a body of comic classics that are remembered perhaps longer than the real candidates.\nLadies and gentlemen, let’s take a look:\nChevy Chase as Gerald Ford\nOn Nov. 8, 1975, original cast member Chevy Chase debuted his impersonation of Ford, the Republican president at that time. Chase portrayed Ford as clumsy and incompetent, tripping and falling over podiums and crashing into desks. A month later, Ford fell down the stairs exiting an airplane, reinforcing Chase’s parody.\nWith Americans soon deciding between Ford and then-Democratic candidate Jimmy Carter for president, Ford’s campaign chose to lean into the show’s jokes. In April 1976, Ford became the first presidential candidate to appear on “SNL”  although only briefly in a pre-recorded cameo  to deliver the iconic line: “Live from New York! it’s Saturday night!”\nCarter ultimately bested Ford in the 1976 presidential election.\n“It was a very close election, and if you look at places where there were big audiences for ‘SNL’ and Carter did better than Ford, you can argue that theres an impact there,” Horner said.\nThough “SNL” has never publicly endorsed a candidate, Chase told a CNN reporter in 2008 that his hope in the ‘70s was that his buffoon version of Ford would help Carter win the election.\nWill Ferrell as George W. Bush and Darrell Hammond’s Al Gore\nThe viral spoofing of the narrow 2000 presidential campaign between then-Democratic Vice President Al Gore and soon-to-be Republican President George W. Bush largely shaped that year’s season.\nWill Ferrell’s Bush was often arrogant, yet somehow confused, allowing the comedian to coin the term strategery in a sketch mocking the former president’s tendency to mispronounce words. Darrell Hammond’s Gore was slow in his delivery and hung up on a vague Social Security proposal called the lock box.\n“That was a time where I really felt that (“SNL”) was pretty fair about taking shots at both candidates,” Jeremy Rasmussen, a 38-year-old Nebraska native and long-time fan of the show, said. “I felt like they were playing the middle very well.”\nDespite the equally exaggerated portrayals and both candidates appearing on the show in November 2000, Ben Voth, author of “Saturday Night Live and Presidential Elections,” found that viewers identified more with Ferrell’s Bush, which created “an alienation between Gore and the public.”\nBush ultimately won the election when less than 600 votes gave him Florida’s electoral votes.\nIn an April 2015 “SNL” documentary, Ferrell said that he believes his impersonation “humanized” Bush for the country and helped him win the election, while Hammond’s “rigid, robot-like” Gore may have contributed to the former vice president’s loss.\nTina Fey as Sarah Palin\nMany speculate that Tina Fey’s impersonation of 2008 GOP vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin had a long-term impact on the public’s perception of the former Alaska governor.\nPalin was the running mate to then-Republican Arizona Sen. John McCain in the 2008 presidential election against then-Democratic Illinois Sen. Barack Obama.\nThe physical similarities between Palin and Fey were striking, and allowed Fey’s impersonation to confuse the public, who often mistook Fey’s jokes as real statements made by Palin, including the famous line “I can see Russia from my house.”\nLike many politicians before her, Palin attempted to play into the joke by appearing alongside Fey in October 2008, which broke the show’s public viewership record at the time.\n“(Palin) has never really been a viable politician since then, and I think a lot of that is because of ‘SNL,’ even though she did try to engage with it,” Horner said. “It just didn’t work for her.”\nAlec Baldwin as Donald Trump\nTrump hosted “SNL” in 2004, when his reality show, “The Apprentice,” was among the most popular in the country, and in 2015 during his first run for the White House.\nAfter his 2016 victory, Trump habitually criticized “SNL” and actor Alec Baldwin’s portrayal of him as a flailing president. In 2019, Trump took to X, formerly Twitter, to urge the Federal Election Commission or Federal Communication Commission to look into the show, alleging collusion with the Democratic Party and Russia.\nBecker found that despite the former president’s aversion for being satirized, Baldwin’s impersonation positively humanized Trump for the public.\n“Alec Baldwin portrayed him as this bumbling guy who was a stranger to politics, kind of like the weird uncle in a sense,” Becker said. “People became more comfortable with the Baldwin version of Trump than the real version of Trump, and they actually liked Trump a little bit more.”\nRasmussen, a self-described moderate who has not voted for a Republican presidential candidate since 2000 and an active member of the Reddit group r/LiveFromNewYork, said Trump’s rise within the Republican Party magnified a shift away from “SNL’s” typical even-handed ridicule of both parties.\n“I think for the right, (“SNL”) has in some ways emboldened them to lean more towards people like Trump,” said Rasmussen, a former political talk show host who now works in risk management. “I think they feel like their views and the things that they value are points of ridicule for the writers and performers of Saturday Night Live.”\nMaya Rudolph as Kamala Harris\nFor its 50th anniversary, “SNL” has brought back former cast members to play prominent figures in the 2024 election, including Maya Rudolph as Harris, Dana Carvey as Biden and Andy Samberg as First Gentleman Doug Emhoff.\nRudolph’s plays of Harris as overly giggly, quick-witted and slightly obsessed with seeming cool  a stark contrast to current cast member James Austin Johnson’s portrayal of Trump as abrasive and crude.\nHarris complimented Rudolph’s impersonation of her during an appearance on “The View” earlier this month.\n“She’s so good,” Harris said. “She had the whole thing — the suit, the jewelry, everything.”\nBecker believes that Rudolph’s “non-controversial” impersonation will warm the public towards Harris, familiarizing them with a version of the candidate, who only became the Democrats’ presidential nominee in July after Biden dropped out.\nHorner and Voth argue that this season could potentially be more damaging to the Harris campaign than her opponent’s due to Trump’s longer history of being a comedic target.\nWhile experts and fans agree “SNL” doesn’t have the impact today it did in its heyday, this season’s shows have drawn millions of viewers and massive reactions on social media.\n“Whether youre a weekly viewer or not, youve probably had some exposure to (“SNL”) or youve seen a sketch from it,” Rasmussen said. “Its just been such a huge part of the American culture since it debuted.”"

    "title": "With one week to go, Harris rallies before White House, makes appeal to protect democracy",
    "content": "WASHINGTON – A week before Election Day, Vice President Kamala Harris on Tuesday urged Americans to “turn the page” on the division caused by former President Donald Trump, delivering her campaign’s closing argument opposite the White House.\nHarris, the Democrats’ standard-bearer, spoke before a massive crowd from the Ellipse, the same place where Trump delivered the speech that helped incite his supporters’ attack on the United States Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. The setting was a visual rebuke to Republican Trump, who Harris called a “petty tyrant” and repeatedly depicted as an agent of chaos and a threat to democracy.\n“America, this is not a candidate for president who is thinking about how to make your life better,” Harris said. “This is someone who is unstable, obsessed with revenge, consumed with grievance and out for unchecked power.”\nShe reiterated her warnings over her 100 days of campaigning that Trump poses a danger to democracy.\nWASHINGTON  These supporters of Vice President Kamala Harris were part of the overflow crowd that spilled onto the National Mall for her closing argument rally on Tuesday. (Katharine Wilson/Capital News Service)\n“We are not a vessel for the schemes of wanna-be dictators,” the vice president said. “The United States of America is the greatest idea humanity ever devised. A nation big enough to encompass all our dreams. Strong enough to withstand any fracture or fissure between us. And fearless enough to imagine a future of possibilities.\nBefore Harris took the stage, Craig Sicknick spoke to the crowd about his brother Brian Sicknick, a U.S. Capitol Police officer who died after responding to the insurrection. Brian Sicknick is one of nine people whose deaths have been linked to the attack.\n“My family knows how dangerous Trump is,” Sicknick said.\nTens of thousands of supporters gathered on the Ellipse to listen to Harris’ address. Even more attendees gathered in an overflow area on the National Mall that stretched back to the Washington Monument.\nSome supporters waited in line for more than four hours to see Harris speak. Despite not getting into the event, people on the National Mall were in high spirits. They danced, clapped and cheered throughout the rally.\nWASHINGTON  Vice President Kamala Harris Tuesday night greets the crowd at a massive rally on the Ellipse opposite the White House, the same spot where former President Donald Trump delivered his infamous Jan. 6, 2021, speech that preceded the attack on the United States Capitol. (James Matheson/Capital News Service)\nPro-Palestinian protesters both on the Ellipse and on Constitution Avenue waved Palestinian flags and chanted for Harris to take a more aggressive stance against Israel’s violence in Gaza. Harris did not mention the conflict in her speech.\nIn most polls, Harris and Trump are within the margin of error of each other nationwide and in the battleground states. The event served as a last-ditch attempt to convince remaining undecided voters, including Republicans and independents, to vote for the Democratic ticket.\nTwo farm owners from Chester County, Pennsylvania, Bob Lange and Lisa Chadwick Lange, preceded Harris at the rally to talk about their change in political allegiance. A lifelong Republican, Bob Lange told the audience he voted for Trump twice,  remarks that received overwhelming boos from the crowd before he said the attack on the Capitol changed his position.\n“I watched that on TV,” Lange told Capital News Service after the rally. “I was just in utter disbelief, saying ‘I can’t believe this.’ And (Trump) was doing nothing … that was the straw that broke the camel’s back.\nWASHINGTON  Amid the afterglow of sunset, a massive crowd spilled onto the National Mall near the Washington Monument to hear Vice President Kamala Harris deliver her closing argument of the campaign. (Marijke Friedman/Capital News Service)\nLange said he’s also grown supportive of Harris’ policies since meeting her and introducing her at other campaign events.\nKey policies Harris listed Tuesday were lowering costs for families, expanding reproductive freedoms, preventing price-gouging by big businesses and protecting the middle class from tax cuts intended to bolster billionaires while leaving America’s workers scraping by.\nHarris, 60, said in her address that “it’s time for a new generation of leadership in America.”\nHoward University freshman Casaya Achampong was in the crowd on Tuesday. The 18-year-old, who calls Harrisburg, Pennsylvania home, told CNS that she’s optimistic but nervous ahead of Election Day.\n“Im so glad that I get to…have a voice in my future,” Achampong said.\nShe said she feels influential as a swing state voter and is hopeful that the new generation of Pennsylvania voters will make the state more Democratic.\nHarris contrasted her vision for America with what another Trump presidency could look like.\n“In less than 90 days, either Donald Trump or I will be in the Oval Office,” Harris said as she pointed to the White House behind her. “On day one, if elected, Donald Trump would walk into that office with an enemies list. When elected, I will walk in with a to-do list.”\n“It is a choice about whether we have a country rooted in freedom for every American or ruled by chaos and division,” she said.\nThe “freedom” theme was echoed throughout the night, with the word displayed on screens before and after Harris’ speech and in her campaign walk-off song, “Freedom,” by Beyoncé.\nLinda Ekizian, a lifelong Democrat, stood in line for the event surrounded by fellow supporters clad in Harris merchandise. She told CNS she believes Harris is the right candidate to lead the country to a better future.\n“The biggest issue is not getting Trump in the White House again,” Ekizian, who lives in Rockville, Maryland, said about her priorities this election.\nIf elected, Harris said she would focus on unifying the nation. She told voters it is necessary to “stop pointing fingers and start locking arms.”\n“Heres what I promise you,” she said. “I will always listen to you. Even if you dont vote for me, I will always tell you the truth, even if it is difficult to hear. I will work every day to build consensus and reach compromise to get things done.”"

    "title": "Basic truths and blatant errors: What AI says about the presidential election",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  Artificial Intelligence can hold many functions including coding, researching, improving business operations and finding a dinner recipe. But could it be just as useful for navigating this presidential election?\nA September poll from Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research and USAFacts found about two-thirds of U.S. adults lack confidence in AI producing reliable information. To test this, Capital News Service asked ChatGPT-4, the current free version of the chatbot, simple questions about the upcoming presidential election and consulted a pair of experts to measure the accuracy of the answers.\nThe results of the experiment were mixed. While ChatGPT provided baseline overviews that could be educational, the flaws of blindly trusting the technology in a rapidly changing political climate were obvious. In particular, ChatGPT erroneously claimed there had not been a presidential debate and that former President Donald Trump had not been convicted of any crimes as of this month. The chatbot also provided outdated information and some sources that could not be verified.\n“One of my students said it’s a status quo machine. it’s really good at finding what’s popular and repeating it,” said Peter Loge, the founding director of the Project on Ethics in Political Communication at the George Washington University’s School of Media and Public Affairs. “Unfortunately, what’s popular is often not accurate and it doesn’t account for new information.”\nQuestions posed to ChatGPT covered the following: issues that could decide the outcome of the election; strengths and weaknesses of each candidate; winners of the Sept. 10 presidential debate between Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris and Trump, the Republican nominee; and winners of the Oct. 1 vice presidential debate between Minn. Gov. Tim Walz, Harris’ running mate, and Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance, Trump’s running mate.\nIssues surrounding the election \nCNS asked the same base questions to ChatGPT multiple times in anticipation of discussions with political experts. Results slightly varied each time, but the main themes of the answers were consistent.\nWhen CNS queried ChatGPT on Oct. 14 what issues will be most important in the 2024 election, it gave 10 in no particular order. Included in the list were:\nThe economy: Inflation and cost of living, as well as issues surrounding wage growth and the future of the workforce\nHealth care: Abortion, health care access and affordability\nClimate change: Renewable energy, fossil fuels, rising energy prices and the transition to clean energy\nImmigration: Border security and immigration policy\nCrime and public safety: Crime rates and ongoing debates surrounding police reform\nEducation: Curriculum battles surrounding critical race theory and LGBTQ+ inclusion, teacher shortages and higher education costs\nGun control: Continued mass shootings, gun control and Second Amendment debates.\nVoting rights and election integrity: Debates surrounding 2020, voter fraud and concerns around gerrymandering\nForeign policy: Middle East tensions, Russia and Ukraine and trade with China\nTechnology and data privacy: Free speech and social media and regulating tech and AI\nBoth Loge and Thessalia Merivaki, associate teaching professor at Georgetown University’s McCourt School of Public Policy and an associate research professor at the school’s Massive Data Institute, said the issues were largely correct.\n“These are issues that matter to voters,” Loge said. “Based on what Ive seen from Pew (Research Center) and Gallup, yeah, people care about this stuff.”\nMerivaki said the results largely reflected a consensus, but was surprised there was no mention of the national debt.\n“Theres a lot of discussion about Trumps proposed tax cuts and increasing the national debt,” Merivaki said.\nALEXANDRIA, Va.  Campaign signs crowd the roadside next to a Fairfax County, Virginia, polling place. (James R. Carroll/Capital News Service)\nWhen asked about Harris’ strengths and weaknesses as of Oct. 14, ChatGPT responded with the following:\nStrengths:\nHistorical significance: Harris is the first female, first Black, and first South Asian vice president giving her a unique profile and appeal, especially to minority groups and women.\nExperience: As a former California attorney general, U.S. senator and current vice president Harris has a strong résumé, with experience in law enforcement, governance, diplomacy and the legislative process.\nProgressive appeal: Harris appeals to many progressives, especially on issues like criminal justice reform, healthcare and climate change. Her positions on social justice, women’s rights and voting rights make her a favorite among certain Democratic groups.\nCampaigning skills: Harris is known for her sharp debating and questioning style, which was highly visible during Senate hearings and on the campaign trail.\nFundraising and party support: As the sitting vice president, Harris has significant party backing and the ability to raise substantial funds. The Democratic establishment will likely rally behind her if she becomes the nominee.\nWeaknesses:\nLow poll numbers and approval ratings: Harris has struggled with consistently low approval ratings, even as vice president. Some polls show her viewed unfavorably by a large segment of the electorate.\nPerception of leadership: Critics, both inside and outside her party, sometimes question her leadership and political acumen.\nHandling of key issues: Harris has faced scrutiny for how she has handled key tasks assigned to her, such as assessing policies on immigration at the U.S.-Mexico border.\nModerate-progressive tensions: Some on the left criticize her for her record as a prosecutor, arguing that she was too tough on criminal justice issues.\nCampaigning style: Some critics argue that Harris lacks the charisma or the strong rhetorical style that excites large crowds.\nMuch of what was said about Harris represents the potential risks of using ChatGPT, or any AI information, especially Harris’ weaknesses, many of which Loge said were out of date. There are examples of inaccurate and outdated wording under strengths as well, including ChatGPT saying “if Harris becomes the nominee” under the fundraising and party support category.\nLoge found issues in the low polling numbers, perception of leadership and campaigning skills categories. He argued that she leads Trump in many polls, has taken strong stances on policy in recent months and has energized crowds of thousands since becoming the Democrats’ standard-bearer in the summer.\n“If GPT is just looking at all of the information available and pulling whats most available, its going to miss that,” Loge said. “She spent way more time as an attorney general, a (2020) presidential candidate and a vice president than she has been running at the top of the ticket in the last ten weeks.”\nWhen asked where it found information on Harris’ weaknesses, ChatGPT cited five articles, all of which were from 2023. CNS asked ChatGPT for the URLs to each article. None of them worked properly.\nOne of the articles that CNS was unable to verify was an alleged Politico article titled “‘You’re in the big leagues now’: Inside Kamala Harris’ frustrating start as vice president,” published on Oct. 11, 2023, more than two-and-a-half years after she assumed the role.\nWhen asked about Trump’s strengths and weaknesses as of Oct. 14, ChatGPT responded with the following:\nStrengths:\nStrong base of support: Trump has a deeply loyal base of supporters.\nPopulist appeal: Trump’s anti-establishment rhetoric and populist message resonate with a significant portion of voters who feel left behind by traditional politics.\nProven fundraising and media savvy: Trump is a fundraising powerhouse and has demonstrated an ability to dominate media cycles, commanding attention through social media, rallies and traditional media.\nEconomic record: Many voters credit Trump with strong economic performance during the first three years of his presidency before the COVID-19 pandemic.\nExperience as a former president: Having already served a term, Trump is seen by many as a leader who knows how to navigate the system.\nWeaknesses:\nControversies and legal challenges: Trump faces numerous legal challenges, including indictments and investigations related to election interference, business practices and more.\nPolarization: His brand of politics tends to alienate as many people as it attracts.\nJanuary 6th and election denial: Trump’s role in the January 6th U.S. Capitol riot and his continued false claims about the 2020 election could undermine his credibility.\nVoter fatigue: Some Republican voters may feel fatigued by the constant controversies surrounding Trump and may look for a fresh face within the party.\nWeakness with key demographics: Trump struggles with key voting blocs like women, young voters and racial minorities.\nMerivaki did not pose any objection to the results regarding Trump, while Loge objected to fundraising being a strength and partially disagreed with the former president having a weakness with key demographics.\nCNN reported that at the beginning of October that Trump’s campaign entered the month with $285 million on hand, $61 million less than Harris, who has consistently bested him in fundraising since entering the race in July.\n“Fundraising is flailing. He had been able to raise a bunch of money in the past,” Loge said. “They are trailing Harris and Walz in fundraising, and recent reports say Trump is losing his mind behind closed doors.”\nWhile Trump’s rhetoric is controversial, he has performed much better with Black and Hispanic voters than his predecessors within the Republican Party, Loge said.\nA recent New York Times/Siena College Poll found Harris leading 78% to 15% among Black voters, and 56% to 37% with Hispanic voters. In 2012, Republican Mitt Romney received 6% of the Black vote and 27% of the Hispanic vote, according to the Roper Center for Public Opinion research.\n“He’s doing better than Republicans have in the past,” Loge said. “It’s a relative strength according to past Republican candidates, it’s a relative weakness compared to Democratic candidates.”\nWhen asked about Walz’s strengths and weaknesses as of Oct. 14, ChatGPT responded with the following:\nStrengths:\nExecutive experience: As the governor of Minnesota since 2019, Walz has executive leadership experience in managing government, navigating crises and addressing state-level policy challenges.\nMilitary background: Walz served in the National Guard for 24 years, retiring as a master sergeant.\nAppeal to rural and urban voters: Walz, who previously represented a rural district in Congress, has experience appealing to both rural and urban voters.\nProgressive governance: Walz is known for supporting progressive policies, but he is also seen as pragmatic, working across party lines when necessary.\nPopularity in Minnesota: Walz has maintained a solid approval rating in Minnesota.\nWeaknesses:\nLimited national profile: Walz does not have a significant national presence or recognition compared to more prominent political figures.\nHandling of civil unrest: Walz faced criticism for his response to the George Floyd protests and subsequent civil unrest in Minneapolis.\nPolicy perception: While Walz supports progressive causes, he is not seen as a leading figure on national progressive issues.\nPartisan tensions: Minnesota politics have become more polarized during his time in office, with sharp criticisms from the Republican Party.\nMerivaki said no errors stood out to her. Loge also said ChatGPT’s evaluation of Walz was largely accurate, although the governor’s military background has been a target of criticism from some prominent Republicans, including Vance.\nLoge said the recap also lacked what has made the Minnesota governor likable to so many voters.\n“Tim Walz’s strength is that he’s incredibly relatable,” Loge said. “He’s a middle class, boring dad jokes guy. I think Tim Walz’s biggest strength is that he’s Tim Walz.”\nWhen asked about Vance’s strengths and weaknesses as of Oct. 14, ChatGPT responded with the following:\nStrengths:\nCultural relevance: Vance gained national attention with his bestselling memoir, Hillbilly Elegy. His story of growing up in a poor, working-class family in Appalachia and rising to success appeals to voters who value the idea of the American Dream.\nAppeal to working-class voters: Vance’s connection to working-class and rural voters in Ohio and other so-called Rust Belt states gives him an advantage.\nSupport from the Republican establishment: Vance secured the endorsement of Donald Trump in his successful Senate campaign.\nOutsider status: Despite his elite credentials as a graduate of Yale Law School and a career in venture capital, Vance has maintained an outsider persona.\nSharp rhetorical skills: Vance is an articulate speaker and debater.\nWeaknesses:\nPerceived flip-flopping: Vance has been criticized for shifting his views. Initially a vocal critic of Trump, Vance later embraced Trump’s policies and sought his endorsement.\nLack of political experience: Vance, elected to the Senate in 2022, has limited experience in governing.\nIdeological extremism: Some of Vance’s rhetoric, such as his comments on abortion and social issues, may alienate moderate or independent voters.\nAssociation with venture capital: His work in venture capital could be used against him.\nPolarization and cultural wars: Vance has been outspoken on cultural issues like race, gender and immigration, taking positions that might resonate with the GOP base but could alienate broader audiences.\n“Both the Walz and Vance (results) are really helpful,” said Merivaki, who cautioned that the answers did not come with citations.\nLoge said his connection to venture capitalism being a weakness is likely an exaggeration. In fact, Loge believes his relationship with Peter Thiel, the billionaire co-founder of PayPal, is actually a strength.\n“J.D. Vance was put on the ticket because he could echo Trumps messaging, but in a disciplined way,” Loge said. “He knows to shut up when Trump is talking and he has access to lots and lots of rich people, and he’s done all those things.”\nThe debates and more errors \nChatGPT followed the general consensus among political observers that Harris was the victor in the Sept. 10 presidential debate while asserting Vance outperformed Walz in the vice presidential debate.\nHowever, when originally asked “who won the presidential debate between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump,” on Oct. 14, ChatGPT answered that a debate had not occurred.\n“If Harris and Trump were to become the nominees in the 2024 election, they could potentially debate each other then,” ChatGPT said. “However, since that hasn’t occurred yet, there’s no clear ‘winner’ between the two in a direct debate.”\nWhen the question was clarified to say the Sept. 10 debate between Harris and Trump, ChatGPT gave a detailed answer, mentioning that Harris forced Trump to be defensive multiple times and focused on his criminal charges and issues with the 2020 elections.\nMerivaki did her own experiment in which she asked ChatGPT, Claude 3.5 Sonnet and Gemini AI systems questions about the election. Gemini said it doesn’t help with responses regarding elections and political figures right now because it can make mistakes, according to a spreadsheet of the results Merivaki shared.\nWhen Merivaki asked about the outcome of Trump’s May hush money trial, both ChatGPT and Claude said that he had not been convicted, despite the opposite being true.\nClaude stated that its “last knowledge update” on this trial was in April, which preceded Trump’s conviction. The basic ChatGPT-4, had no such disclaimer, while ChatGPT Omni, a version of the language model that has expanded capabilities, had correct information about Trump’s 34 May convictions.\nCNS asked the basic model and Omnion Wednesday about Trump’s convictions and found that Omni provided factually correct information, while the more widely used free model was incorrect again.\n“As of October 2024, Donald Trump has not been convicted of any crimes, but he faces several high-profile legal cases, both civil and criminal,” the ChatGPT-4 model said.\nAfter multiple follow-up questions and being given an article from the Associated Press about the conviction, the basic version finally provided information.\nWhen consumers use ChatGPT, it offers a caution at the bottom of the screen: “ChatGPT can make mistakes. Check Important info.”\nThis remains especially true when it comes to politics, according to Merivaki, who urged citizens to read the news and to follow their local election officials to learn how to best vote.\n“For those broad comparisons, because the candidates are so different, the summaries that we’re going to get are very helpful,” Merivaki said. “But when it comes to…more detailed prompts about very controversial discussion topics in this cycle, I really wonder how much detail we’re going to get.”"

    "title": "McClain Delaney, Parrott tangle in Maryland&#8217;s most competitive House race",
    "content": "FREDERICK, Md. – With less than two minutes left at an otherwise cordial Frederick League of Women Voters forum on Oct. 6, two candidates for Congress suddenly erupted. \nThey pointed fingers, accused each other of lying and continued whisper-arguing as the forum’s ending announcements wrapped up. \nThe verbal combatants were Democrat April McClain Delaney and Republican Neil Parrott, who are running for the 6th Congressional District, which stretches from rural Western Maryland to the Montgomery County suburbs.\nThe district is a politically diverse territory that has produced the most competitive House race in predominantly Democratic Maryland.   \nAs Election Day looms, here is a breakdown of the 6th District contest.\nThe candidates \nMcClain Delaney, a communications attorney, said she wants to work from the “common sense, common ground middle” in Congress. \nHer main policy goals are codifying abortion access, improving the economy for businesses and families, strengthening border security and protecting children’s safety online. \nMcClain Delaney, who grew up in rural Idaho, most recently worked in the Biden administration as a deputy assistant secretary for communications and information at the Department of Commerce. She previously was the Washington director and a board member for Common Sense Media, a non-profit promoting online safety for children. \nWhen the incumbent, Rep. David Trone, D-Maryland, announced his decision to run in this years Senate primary, McClain Delaney said she got calls from people across the 6th District asking her to run to keep the House seat for Democrats. The decision to be a candidate, however, came down to being a mother, she said.\n“I looked at my four girls, and said, ‘Its their future and someone has to do it,’” McClain Delaney told Capital News Service.\nParrott, who is running for this House seat for the third time, is a former member of the Maryland House of Delegates who represented Washington County from 2011 to 2023. He is campaigning on lowering taxes, decreasing the size of the government and bringing more jobs to the district. The engineer says he wants to bring “practical solutions” to Washington. \nOn the campaign trail, Parrott touts his roots in the district, which include his home in the Hagerstown area, founding the Hagerstown Area Summer Swimming program and his past job as a deputy director of public works for the city of Frederick.\nParrott has repeatedly criticized McClain Delaney for running to represent a district she does not live in. She lives just outside district lines in Potomac. \nMcClain Delaney counters that she knows the district well. Her husband, John Delaney, represented the 6th District from 2013 to 2019. \nBut, McClain Delaney told CNS, “I run my own race.”\nIf elected, Parrott said he would join the House Freedom Caucus, a hard-right group of GOP lawmakers headed by Rep. Andy Harris, R-Maryland. \nMcClain Delaney has called Parrott “out-of-this-world extreme” and said he would be as ineffective in Congress as he was in the state legislature. In 2019, CNS ranked Parrott as the least effective member of the state legislature after failing to pass any bills that he was the lead sponsor for. \nParrott, however, told CNS last month that he was actually productive for a Republican in the Democratic-controlled state legislature. \n“She just doesnt even know what shes talking about,” Parrott said in an interview with CNS. “She has no record at all.” \nMcClain Delaney’s campaign has run attack ads and spoken publicly about Parrott’s actions in the Maryland state legislature, including Parrott co-sponsoring a fetal personhood bill, which if passed would have blocked abortion access. She also has criticized Parrott for his votes against removing state provisions that allowed a spousal defense against rape if there was no force or threat of force. \nIn 2022, Parrott called the legislation removing the spousal defense “ridiculous,” and argued that because common law says it’s illegal to rape your spouse, the law didn’t have to change. \n“Were talking like fourth-degree offense. I mean you just pat them in the wrong way, they take it sexually inappropriately. Thats marriage. Those things are protected in marriage and this law gets rid of that,” Parrott said on the floor of the House of Delegates in 2022.\nWhen Parrott was asked about his vote on the bill in an interview with CNS, Parrott simply pointed out that the bill did not pass that year due to an issue with a state Senate amendment and put the blame on Democrats.\nMaryland ended the spousal defense for rape in 2023. \nParrott told CNS that he supports abortion regulations being left up to the states and did not comment on whether or not he would vote for a national abortion ban. The candidate said he will be voting against the ballot initiative in Maryland to enshrine the right to abortion in the state constitution. \nDuring a Washington County Chamber of Commerce forum last Wednesday, Parrott said he supports exceptions to abortion restrictions, such as in cases of rape, incest and when the mother’s life is at risk.\nFundraising and spending\nMcClain Delaney is outspending and out fundraising her opponent, according to the latest Federal Election Commission reports. \nThe Democrat’s campaign raised more than $740,600 from donors between July 1 and Sept. 30, while Parrott raised about $276,000. \nMcClain Delaney spent more than $640,000 last quarter while Parrott spent $178,100. \nMatthew Klein, analyst with the nonpartisan Cook Political Report, said that part of the reason why Parrott isn’t as effective in raising money is his past failed runs for the same House seat. \n“Its hard to get people to be willing to put their actual money on the line if they dont think youre going to win,” Klein said. \nParrott lost in 2022 by more than nine percentage points and in 2020 by almost 20 percentage points. However, Parrott said this race is different because there is no incumbent and people in the 6th District don’t know McClain Delaney.\nPolling and rating  \nA Democrat has represented the 6th District in Congress since 2013. \nWith mostly rural Western Maryland leaning Republican and Montgomery County favoring Democrats, Frederick County appears to be the battleground of this House race. \nFrederick County has not voted consistently for the same political party in recent presidential elections – going for Republican Donald Trump in 2016 and Democrat Joe Biden in 2020. \nIn 2022 redistricting, parts of Democratic-heavy Montgomery County were also taken away from the district as the rest of Frederick County was added, making the district more competitive. \nThe national Democratic and Republican parties appear to be focusing on the 6th District more than usual this cycle. \nMcClain Delaney was added to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee’s “Red to Blue” program last month. The designation means the party is devoting more resources and funding to seats it considers important to keep or, in other districts, take away from the GOP. \nThe National Republican Congressional Committee last month placed 54-year-old Parrott on its “young guns” list – a group of candidates in open seats to which the party intends to provide additional help. \nThe Cook Political Report currently lists the 6th District race as competitive but likely to result in a Democratic win.\nBut an August poll, conducted by Gonzales Research and Marketing Strategies, showed Parrott with a 41-39% lead over McClain Delaney, with a margin of error of plus or minus 5.6 percentage points."

    "title": "D.C. Council bill would prohibit utility shutoffs in summer, winter",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  When Ericka Yarborough fell behind on her utility bills last winter, Pepco shut off the power in her Columbia Heights apartment. It stayed off for nearly eight months.\nNo power meant living in the dark, showering in cold water and no refrigerator to store groceries. It also meant no heat during the coldest months of the year.\n“It was rough during the winter time,” said Yarborough, 34, who lives in subsidized housing and receives public assistance. “Its freezing cold. You got to put on a million blankets, if you even have a million blankets. …Youll be freezing cold. You barely want to get up.”\n“Just living and going through this, its really hard, and its frustrating,” she said.\nA proposal before the D.C. Council this year would expand utility protections for vulnerable residents like Yarborough by guaranteeing electricity and gas connection throughout the summer and winter months.\nThe bill, introduced by Council members Brianne K. Nadeau, D-Ward 1, and Trayon White, D-Ward 8, would prohibit utility companies in the District from disconnecting electricity or gas to certain households from May 15 through Sept. 15, and Nov. 1 through Feb. 29.\nCurrently, D.C. law prevents utility disconnections during weekends, holidays and when the temperature climbs above 95 degrees or below 32 degrees.\n“In the District, we have some safeguards in place so that people won’t have their power turned off when it’s extremely hot or extremely cold. The reality is — and what I’ve heard from residents who are struggling to pay their rent, utilities, food and more — is that it’s not enough,” Nadeau said in an Oct. 8 statement. This bill “is a way to ease at least part of that burden as residents work to get above water. And it’s a way to protect our most vulnerable residents from unhealthy living conditions,” the statement added.\nUnder the proposal, titled the “Utility Disconnection Protection Act of 2024,” the expanded protections would apply to households with children under 18, seniors over 65, individuals with disabilities and recipients of certain public assistance programs. The District’s Department of Energy and the Environment would be responsible for the new regulations.\nIf passed, the bill would require utility providers to offer payment plans to protected customers who have been disconnected due to nonpayment. It would also put a $25 limit on the amount a company can charge to restore a customer’s power or gas. Currently, companies can require that an overdue balance is paid in full before restoring service to a customer.\nThe bill contains a provision requiring utility companies to file monthly reports on the number of disconnections and unpaid bills broken down by ward and ZIP code. Utility companies currently have to file reports quarterly and do not differentiate by area.\n“The Utility Disconnection Protection Act could serve as a piece of legislation to provide pivotal consumer protections” to disadvantaged residents, said Kintéshia Scott, assistant people’s counsel at the Office of the People’s Counsel, an independent agency of D.C. government. Scott said many residents have yet to financially recover from the pandemic and “there are a number of consumers who face economic challenges and who are struggling to catch back up.” \nIn a statement, a spokesperson for Pepco, the District’s public electric utility, said that while the company “fully understands and shares the concerns that have prompted the introduction of the ‘Utility Disconnection Protection Act,’” implementing “a new moratorium on disconnections, while well-intended, risks creating unintended consequences. Such a prolonged measure could leave customers with insurmountable debt.”\nThe statement added that Pepco offers flexible payment options and only disconnects customers as a last resort.\nA representative for Washington Gas said in an email that the company would comply with the bill if it passes. He added that Washington Gas does not disconnect customers when temperatures fall below 32 degrees.\nNadeau, however, maintained that the current temperature-based regulations are flawed. \n“If Pepco turns off the electricity on Monday when it’s 89 degrees and on Tuesday the temperature rises to 95, they don’t have to turn it back on,” she said in the Oct. 8 statement. “With more and more 90-degree days as the climate changes, saying that electricity can be shut off in the heat of summer – just not on the day temps rise over 95, isn’t enough. Those are conditions in which nobody should have to live, much less children with asthma, struggling seniors and other vulnerable populations.”\nSelah Goodson Bell, an energy justice campaigner at the Center for Biological Diversity and one of a group of advocates who pushed for the bill’s introduction, said the proposed changes are an important step forward.\n“One of the main things the bill is trying to fix is the fact that were seeing shutoffs still peak during the summer, but these shutoffs are most dangerous for particularly vulnerable households,” Goodson Bell said. “Residents like seniors, youth, pregnant or postpartum individuals, and also individuals with a disability. All these different groups are more sensitive than the average person to extreme temperatures.”\nThe legislation comes as many District residents are struggling with the cost of utilities. \nIn the first eight months of 2024, Pepco sent 113,105 disconnection notices to customers, including 23,181 to low-income customers, according to a company report to the D.C. Public Service Commission. In the same time period, Pepco disconnected residential customers for nonpayment 6,396 times, 1,076 of which were for low-income customers.\nFor Yarborough, easing the financial burden of getting reconnected would be a game-changer. \n“I think that would have definitely made a difference, because, you know, its 300 and something dollars” to pay the full bill and be reconnected now, she said. “And (it) should be like, ‘Can you pay $50 to $75?’ Thats reasonable.”\nA resident of Columbia Heights Village, a subsidized apartment complex, Yarborough was ultimately able to get her utilities restored earlier this year with the support of community organizations like the Columbia Heights Village Tenants Association.\nCynthia Hall, the tenant association’s chief operating officer, said that many residents of the property face similar challenges. Within the previous two to three years, “probably at least three to four dozen of our residents have been disconnected. Probably about a dozen for extended periods of time, meaning exceeding 90 days or more,” Hall said.\nHall applauded Nadeau for pushing increased protections in the bill. \n“The fact that the council member really cares to push this bill, to initiate and to push the bill, with hopes that this wont happen in the future,” means that, “even if these (residents) fall into a financial hardship again, they dont have to worry about sitting in their apartment in 30-degree weather without power,” she said.\nThe bill has been referred to the council’s Committee on Business and Economic Development and the Committee on Transportation and the Environment.\nNeither committee has scheduled a hearing for the bill, and it may not get heard before the council period ends this year.\nIf so, Nadeau spokesperson David Connery-Marin said the council member plans to reintroduce the bill next year."

    "title": "With Senate control at stake, top Republicans give millions to Hogan&#8217;s bid",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  Despite having “Republican” under his name on Marylands ballots, former Gov. Larry Hogan has been running for the U.S. Senate on the notion that he’s more of an independent, someone who can work on either side of the political aisle.\nThat messaging hasn’t stopped Hogan’s campaign from receiving significant campaign support from Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, as well as two Republican senators vying to replace him as the next GOP Senate leader: John Cornyn of Texas and John Thune of South Dakota.\nHogan, who was recruited to run in the election by McConnell, is pitted against Prince George’s County Executive Angela Alsobrooks in what is considered one of the country’s most pivotal contests. The Maryland seat is being vacated by retiring Democratic Sen. Ben Cardin.\nThe Hogan campaign declined to respond to questions by phone and email about the contributions.\nHogan’s campaign has received more than $235,000, including a $75,000 contribution on Sept. 25, from the Cornyn Victory Committee, according to Federal Election Committee reports filed on Tuesday.\nPolitico reported that Thune’s super PAC, New Heights Action, has given $1 million to PACs to help Hogans campaign.\nNew Heights Action has given $750,000 to Maryland’s Future, a super PAC supporting Hogan, according to the FEC filings.\nA McConnell-linked super PAC, Senate Leadership Fund, gave $2 million to Maryland’s Future in July.\nMaryland’s Future has been behind a wave of advertising engulfing the state and had $16 million left to spend as of Sept. 30.\nAt the end of September, Axios reported that WinSenate, a Democratic PAC linked to Chuck Schumer, was launching $1.1 million worth of ads for Alsobrooks over the first two weeks of this month.\nWith the aid of four independent senators who caucus with them, Democrats hold a two-seat advantage in the Senate. Hogan swinging a seat in Maryland, a deeply Democratic state, would represent a major political coup for the Republicans.\n“I think there’s always one race that people aren’t paying attention to that we end up picking up. I think that could be Maryland this time,” Cornyn said in a Sept. 24 conversation with Capital News Service.\nBoth Cornyn and Thune have flexed their well-established fundraising muscles as they, along with Rick Scott, R-Florida, seek to succeed McConnell, who is relinquishing his leadership post at the end of the year.\nOn Sept. 24, Cornyn sent out a letter to donors detailing that he has raised more than $400 million since he joined the Senate in 2002.\nThe Cornyn Victory Committee has raised nearly $16 million in this election cycle, according to Open Secrets. The money has been spread out among a number of candidates, with Hogan being near the middle of the group in terms of total donations from the Texan’s PAC.\nThe Hill reported last month that Thune announced at a political strategy meeting that he would transfer $4 million from his personal campaign to the National Republican Senatorial Committee in an effort to chip away at the large fundraising advantage held by Democrats. The donation was the largest ever by a Senate Republican, doubling the previous record, set by Thune in 2016.\nThe Alsobrooks campaign has held a fundraising advantage over Hogan’s campaign in recent months.\nAlsobrooks’ principal campaign committee raised more than $13.4 million in the last cycle from July 1 through Sept. 30, significantly more than Hogan, whose campaign committee raised $3.3 million in the same period, according to FEC filings.\nBoth Hogan and Alsobrooks have joint fundraising arrangements with party fundraising committees that provide their campaigns with additional funds while raising money for their parties.\nThe Alsobrooks Victory Fund, created by her campaign and the Democratic State Central Committee of Maryland, raised nearly $3.8 million during the reporting period. Similarly, the Hogan Victory Fund, set up between his campaign and the National Republican Senatorial Campaign, raised $5.4 million.\nAlsobrooks principal campaign committee had almost $3.4 million in cash on hand at the end of last month. Hogan’s principal committee reported nearly $1.6 million in cash on hand.\nHogan is Maryland’s first two-term Republican governor in over 60 years and remains fairly popular.\nA University of Maryland Baltimore poll released on Oct. 9 said 53% of likely Maryland voters had a favorable opinion of Hogan, compared to 49% for Alsobrooks.\nHowever, the poll gave Alsobrooks a nine-point lead in a race that was neck-and-neck only a month ago.\nSome analysts believe a major reason for Alsobrooks’ advantage could be Hogan’s party allegiance: the former governor is sharing the ticket with former President Donald Trump. Even though Trump endorsed him, Hogan is not returning the favor, saying he will not vote for the GOP standard-bearer.\nHogan’s party ties were a major focus in his Oct. 10 debate with Alsobrooks, with the Prince George’s county executive repeatedly warning of the dangers of a Republican-controlled Senate.\nMore than 30% of those surveyed in the UMBC poll cited either support for Democratic control of the Senate or reproductive rights as their reason for voting for Alsobrooks.\n“We are facing an election where the future of our country and our freedoms are at stake,” Alsobrooks said during the debate. “The Republican Party has declared war on women’s reproductive freedoms, we recognize that this party of chaos and division led by Donald Trump can not lead this country and also has severe consequences for Marylanders.”\nThroughout the debate, Hogan characterized himself as someone who could overcome partisan politics.\n“I think what we need desperately in Washington are people that are willing, that have the courage to put country over party and to put people over politics, and to stand up to the leaders of their party,” Hogan said. “I dont think theres anyone in America who has done that more than me.”"

    "title": "Congress sends more help, but security concerns persist after Trump assassination attempts",
    "content": "WASHINGTON – Congress passed two bills before taking an election break that are intended to improve protections around the presidential candidates as security concerns and political tensions persist following two assassination attempts on former President Donald Trump.\nOne measure, the Enhanced Presidential Security Act, requires the United States Secret Service to provide the same level of security for presidential and vice presidential candidates from major parties that is provided for the incumbent president and vice president. President Joe Biden signed that bill into law Oct. 1. \nCongress also allotted an additional $231 million to the Secret Service in the short-term government funding extension that  Biden signed into law Sept. 26.\n“I don’t want Kamala Harris and I don’t want Donald Trump to have any less protection than the sitting president of the United States  we’re just at that level now,” Barry Donadio, who served nearly eight years as a Secret Service agent under the George W. Bush and Obama administrations, told Capital News Service. “Right now in the United States the political turmoil, the danger and recent attempts on one candidate, we had to go to that level.”\nDonadio has served in security roles from local law enforcement to protection for former President Bill Clinton and Air Force One with the 106th Rescue Wing Security Police at the Francis S. Gabreski Air National Guard Base at Westhampton Beach, New York. The Kent Island, Maryland, resident owns a private investigation and security firm, is the sergeant at arms of the Maryland Republican Party and served as an alternate delegate to the Republican National Convention.\nBoosting security to presidential levels for Harris and Trump “is an enormous expense for the Secret Service, to government, to taxpayers and an enormous drain to an already depleted Secret Service that, since the year 1865, has not had enough manpower to really do all they do,” Donadio said, referring to the year the Secret Service was established, shortly after the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln. “They’ve never sat comfortably and said, ‘Well, we have so many people, why don’t you take Sunday off?’’’\nAmid recent backlash against the Secret Service, the creation of a House task force investigating the attempted assassination of Trump in July and the resignation of former Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle, Donadio said the agency should be recognized for its response to criticisms rather than attacked.\n“I’m the odd ball out of, I guess, the entire world,” the former agent said. “There’s attempts, no matter who or what you are, that are going to happen.”\nRather than placing blame on the Secret Service, the public should recognize the bravery and dedication to duty by the agents during the assassination attempts on Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, and at the former president’s West Palm Beach, Florida, golf course, Donadio said.\n“The Secret Service, at least in my time and as far back as I know, has always been understaffed,” he said. “They are so specialized in what they do. Youve heard them testify to this in court: it takes years to make a Secret Service agent.”\nDonadio’s claim is mirrored by a 2015 report by the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee titled “United States Secret Service: An Agency In Crisis.” \nThe 438-page report found “a workforce on the verge of collapsing due to understaffing and pending attrition” and cited “the exhaustive nature of the job, constant overtime, and lack of respect from Presidential Protective Division leadership as major factors in (Uniformed Division) attrition.”\nAt a Sept. 26 hearing of the House Task Force on the Attempted Assassination of Donald J. Trump, lawmakers expressed alarm at communication and planning failures by the Secret Service in Butler. \n“Because of failures by the Secret Service, the shooting was not prevented,” said Rep. Mike Kelly, R-Pennsylvania, and chairman of the task force. “Just last week, Acting Director (Ronald) Rowe said his own agency showed ‘complacency.’ The day of the assassination attempt, (Thomas Matthew) Crooks scouted and identified weaknesses in the Secret Service’s security plan using both a drone and range finder. Had security vulnerabilities not existed, it is entirely plausible he might not have even attempted the shooting and returned home.”\nCheatle resigned on July 23, just 10 days after the first Trump assassination attempt, following blistering criticism from lawmakers including Rep. James Comer, R-Kentucky, the chairman of the House oversight panel, and Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland, the ranking Democrat on the committee.\nIn addition to accepting responsibility on behalf of his own agency, Rowe placed blame on local law enforcement in Butler for the Trump shooting. \n“We were told that building was going to be covered,” Rowe said at a joint hearing of the Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs and Judiciary Committees on July 30. “There had been a face-to-face that afternoon.” \nSen. Gary Peters, D-Michigan, called the Secret Service’s failures in Pennsylvania “inexcusable.”\nA follow-up Sept. 25 bipartisan report by the Senate homeland security panel said that the Secret Service failed to clearly outline planning and security responsibilities for the Butler rally, did not coordinate effectively with state and local police agencies, and failed to provide enough security resources for the event, among other shortcomings.\n“From planning missteps, to the siloed and flawed communication to the lack of effective coordination between law enforcement, to the breakdowns in technology, the Secret Service’s failures that allowed an assassination attempt on former President Trump at his July 13 rally were shocking, unacceptable, and preventable – and they led to tragic consequences,” Peters said in a statement.\nSen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, the ranking Republican on the committee, said in a statement: “Someone needs to be held accountable for these egregious failures by the USSS, and despite USSS, DHS, FBI, ATF, and other federal agencies’ continued obstruction of our bipartisan investigation, I will continue to push for answers and accountability.”"

    "title": "Immigrant groups back Harris, warn of “unsparing” deportation to come",
    "content": "Thirteen immigrant-rights groups endorsed Kamala Harris for president on Thursday, warning that the election of Donald Trump could devastate immigrant communities across the country. \n“They have made clear that their proposed largest deportation operation in the history of our country would be unsparing and indiscriminate in targeting immigrants,” Vanessa Cárdenas, executive director of America’s Voice, said of Trump and his running mate, Sen. JD Vance of Ohio. \nSpeaking during a Zoom press conference with participants across the nation, several members of FIRM Action, a national political action network, described Harris as the candidate more suited to address migration and border issues in the U.S. \nDuring the news conference, participants raised concerns about Trump and Vance’s rhetorical attacks on immigrants. \nTrump’s campaign website lists immigration as his top priorities. The first item on his agenda, according to the website, is to “seal the border and stop the migrant invasion.” The second item is to “carry out the largest deportation operation in American history.” Capital News Service reached out to the campaign for a more specific response on Thursday but did not receive one.\nResponding to a question from CNS, one of the activists predicted that a Trump administration would harm immigrant communities in Maryland right along with the rest of the country.\n\n“We refuse to go back to this nightmare,” said Gustavo Torres, board president for CASA in Action, a political action group working at the state and federal level.\n“For black and brown immigrants and working families, this election is about survival,” he said. \nHarris recognizes the difference between immigrants fleeing violence and those who are perpetrating it, said Christine Neumann-Ortiz, executive director of Voces de la Frontera Action. \n“She distinguishes between people who are cartels and organized crime,” said Neumann-Ortiz, “and people who are fleeing cartels.”"

    "title": "Maryland unions seek influence in election beyond membership numbers",
    "content": "WASHINGTON – When Darlene Butler-Jones, a 66 year-old shop steward for Giant, walks into a store, people listen. \nButler-Jones is part of a group of grocery store workers assigned by her union – United Food  Commercial Workers Union Local 400 – to explain the organization’s political endorsements to her fellow employees. \nAs she walks through the store, talking to employees at cash registers and counters, Butler-Jones hears their concerns about fair scheduling, retirement, and dignity in the workplace. \n“People want change,” Butler-Jones said. \nAs Democrats and Republicans argue over which party truly represents working people and who will secure their vote, Maryland union leaders say it’s not about party, it’s about policy. \nCapital News Service spoke to six Maryland-based union presidents and political leaders to better understand how union endorsements work and the impact of unions on politics in Maryland.\nWhat the unions, and their members, want\nMaryland union leaders said they are focused on improving the lives of their members, which most said comes down to their ability to organize. \nDonna S. Edwards is the president of the Maryland State and D.C. AFL-CIO, a federation of more than 50 unions. \nTo get union backing, Edwards said, politicians need to support the Protecting the Right to Organize Act, commonly known as the PRO-Act, and the Public Service Freedom to Negotiate Act, a bill to guarantee the right to organize for public sector employees.\nThe PRO-Act, a bill promoted by the labor movement, aims to protect the right to join and form a union by prohibiting common employer intimidation tactics and requiring employees represented by collective bargaining units to pay their fair share of representation fees. \nThis Congress, 263 Democrats, three Republicans and two independents sponsored the PRO-Act. The bill has not been put up for a vote in either chamber. The Public Service Freedom to Negotiate Act has seen no action.\nTo get an endorsement from the Maryland State and D.C. AFL-CIO, candidates must first fill out surveys detailing their stances on nearly every issue in some way related to labor. Then top candidates are interviewed by union members and leaders before a final selection is made. \nThe top three factors union officials making the AFL-CIO endorsements consider are the candidate’s views on issues, viability and voting record, according to Kayla Mock, the political and legislative director for the local food and commercial workers union, which falls under the state’s AFL-CIO. \nUnions are focused on fundamental issues important to working people, like healthcare, child care, and the right to organize, Mock said. These issues, many union leaders say, typically favor Democratic candidates. \nIn the 2024 election, the Maryland State and D.C. AFL-CIO only endorsed Democratic candidates for Congress.  \n“I tell my members this all the time, please bring me a pro-labor Republican. I would love to talk to them. I would love to endorse them,” Mock said. \nWhile many major unions in Maryland endorsed Democrats for local and federal office, as they have continuously done for decades, this isn’t true among all unions and union endorsements aren’t always followed by rank-and-file members. \nMaryland-based Teamsters Joint Councils 55 and 62 endorsed the presidential campaign of Vice President Kamala Harris, breaking from the national union’s decision to not endorse a candidate. However, in a Teamsters member poll from July 24 to Sept. 15, 49.4% of Maryland members wanted the national union to endorse Trump, compared to 46.5% for Harris.\nIn the 2020 election, around 60% of union households voted for President Joe Biden, Axios reported. \nJason Ascher, the Mid-Atlantic Pipe Trades Association’s political director, said he has some union members who will vote for former President Donald Trump regardless of what Ascher and other union leaders recommend.\nThis trend, particularly among the building trades, Ascher said, followed the 1994 implementation of the North American Free Trade Agreement — a pact among the United States, Mexico and Canada — that the Economic Policy Institute, a non-profit think tank affiliated with the labor movement, says led to the loss of thousands of union jobs. \nThe trade agreement, combined with social issues promoted by Democrats, pro-gun attitudes and the populism of Trump, created hard-line Republican voters within the union base, Ascher said. Now he and others are working at the local level to draw more of their union members back into voting for endorsed Democrats. \n“Its a fight every day,” Ascher said. “We have to convince our members, at least in the trades, that the Democrats are the ones helping us right now.”\nRyan Whittington, the president of the Ocean City Career Firefighters Paramedics Association, leads one of a dozen first-responder unions endorsing the Senate candidacy of former Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, a Republican. \nWhen his union’s board of directors decides to get involved in a state or local election, Whittington said, they open up a poll to every member of the union to select their preferred candidate. In the 2024 Maryland Senate race, Whittington said only two members of his union, which has more than 70 people, did not want the union to endorse Hogan. \n“Within our local we have individuals who are Democrats, we have individuals who are Republicans,” Whittington said. “For us, its about looking at a candidate who is going to listen to the needs of our firefighters, our public safety officials, and make sure that they have our backs.” \nWho looks at union endorsements\nWhile union members made up just 10.7% of the Maryland working population in 2023, union leaders say their impact stretches beyond their membership.\n!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r=0;r\n\n“We are members of the same communities that we're working in and living in. We're the next door neighbors,” said Paul Lemle, the president of the Maryland State Education Association. “It's natural that people trust us.”\nUnion popularity has seen record highs nationwide in recent years. In an August Gallup poll, 70% of Americans said they approved of labor unions. \nPart of this increase can be attributed to younger Americans. \nAround 88% of people under 30 supported unions in an August 2023 poll by the Democratic polling and research firm GBAO, conducted on behalf of the AFL-CIO. \nMock said she has seen first-hand a rise in young people embracing unions.\nHer chapter of UFCW – which includes 35,000 workers across six states and the District of Columbia –  held two successful union membership votes for cannabis dispensary workers within one week in Montgomery County, Maryland.\nMock, who was a delegate to the Democratic National Convention, said this attention from younger voters could be behind the Democratic strategy to boost the union vote.\n“We're kind of the cool kids club,” Mock said. “Democrats, very smartly, are going ‘oh yeah, we actually do need labor.’”\nIn the 2022 statewide election, Maryland State Education Association members voted at a 24 percentage point rate higher than the rest of the state, according to the director of the union’s political and legislative affairs, Samantha Zwerling. In every election, she said, politicians endorsed by the education association have more than an 80% chance of winning. \n“Unions are inherently part of the democratic fabric of our society...That's what's meant by freedom of assembly and freedom of speech… they encourage participation and democracy,” Lemle, the union president, said. \nCHICAGO — Donna S. Edwards, president of Maryland State and D.C. AFL-CIO, holds up a pro-union placard on the first night of the 2024 Democratic National Convention in August. (Katharine Wilson/Capital News Service)\n\nWhat unions want the public to know\n\n“Unions are not these big bosses. Look at me. I'm the union,” Edwards, the Maryland State and D.C. AFL-CIO president, said. \nThe talkative, charismatic union leader was sitting in an emptying event space during the Democratic National Convention in August, showing her union friends in the Maryland delegation a photo of her holding a “Union Yes!” sign during the convention the night before. \nEdwards, a social-worker by trade, grew up in a union home. She first joined a union while working for the Baltimore City Department of Social Services in the 1970s. \nHer union leadership was able to get a pay raise for her unit of social workers — kicking off her passion for labor activism. \nThe union “is the only institution, in my view, that holds the line on a democracy in this country,” Edwards said. “It allows for workers and their families to be involved in the political process, but it also gives you the financial security… to be able to be a contributing part of your community.”"

    "title": "After World Series triumph, Nats suffer a historic five-year fade",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  Jarad Kopf has been a Nationals fan since the team relocated to the nation’s capital in 2005. He attended the team’s second-ever home game and still remembers that John Patterson was the starting pitcher.\nWatching the team win the 2019 World Series was the most gratifying moment of his nearly two-decade obsession with the team.\n“It was just like this huge monkey was let off the back,” said Kopf, 37, from northern Virginia, who added that he cried immediately after the last strike of the series. “It was a euphoric feeling.”\nThe 2019 World Series gave Washington its first baseball championship in 95 years. But the post-title drop off has been almost unprecedented.\nCapital News Service measured the winning percentage of every World Series champion in the five seasons after winning the title since 1903. The Nationals .407 winning percentage since hoisting the Commissioners Trophy is the second-lowest of any World Series champion in the half-decade after winning the title.\nThe only champion with a worse post-series, five-year slump is the 1913 Philadelphia Athletics, who had a .386 winning percentage from 1914-1918.\nUnlike the Nationals, who haven’t been to the playoffs since 2019, the 1913 Athletics made it back to the World Series in 1914. But after being swept by the Boston Braves and facing incredible financial competition from the upstart Federal League, team owner Connie Mack parted ways with a number of star players, including multiple future Hall of Famers.\nIn 1916, Mack’s team had a .235 winning percentage and were nicknamed “the Pathetics.”\n“It’s oddly fitting that they’re right there with the Pathetics,” Kopf said of the Nationals. “I’m almost shocked they weren’t worse.”\nThe Nationals fall was much different from the slide of the Athletics, who won their third World Series in four seasons in 1913. In the Nationals case, there was no new league poaching players and no individual moment of heartbreak that turned the tide of the success.\nInstead, a pandemic, injuries, a lack of aggressiveness to acquire proven talent and the wait for young talent to form a new core doomed the post-title Washington club.\n“They werent doing any of the things that you have to do to become competitive in any kind of short-to-medium-term time frame,” said Michael Baumann, a writer for the baseball statistics and analysis site FanGraphs. “They werent drafting particularly well. They werent developing particularly well. They werent signing free agents.”\nThe Nationals declined to comment for this story.\n!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r=0;r\nThe fall off\nBaumann called the Nationals 2020 season “the mother of all World Series hangovers.”\nFollowing their title, the Nationals lost star third baseman Anthony Rendon to the Los Angeles Angels. Then, as a result of COVID-19, the season was shortened to just 60 games.\nThe one positive heading into that shortened season was the team had re-signed World Series MVP Stephen Strasburg to a seven-year, $245 million contract that practically ensured he would spend the rest of his career with the Nationals.\nThe team went 26-34, a .433 winning percentage, in the pandemic season and finished last in the National League East. Worst of all, Strasburg got hurt in his second start of the year.\nStrasburg was the top selection in the 2009 MLB Draft, and his debut in 2010 represented a new hope for a franchise that had yet to experience success. Despite battling injuries, Strasburg had been a three-time All-Star and finished fifth in National League Cy Young voting in 2019.\nWhen he entered free agency after the World Series, Strasburg, much like Rendon, had the option to ditch the Nationals for a bigger market. Instead, he chose to re-sign with Washington.\nAfter his injury in 2020, Strasburg only pitched six more games, making his final appearance in 2022 before officially retiring in April.\n“He wanted to be in D.C., which not very many people do,” Kopf said. “He could have left for the Yankees and been a stud in New York and gotten way more money and fame, and he didn't. He wanted to stay here and it was sad to see that (injury).”\nThe Nationals continued to struggle in 2021 and at the trade deadline, Nationals General Manager Mike Rizzo orchestrated a fire sale. The centerpiece of the six trades Rizzo made was shipping Max Scherzer, a three-time Cy Young Award winner, and 27-year-old shortstop Trea Turner, to the Los Angeles Dodgers. Both were instrumental in the Nationals’ title run.\n“You could kind of tell they were running on fumes,” Kopf said of the 2021 team.\nThe next year brought even more devastating news to Nationals fans: Rizzo traded Juan Soto to the San Diego Padres in August.\nSoto was 23 at the time of the trade and already a two-time All-Star.\nIn return, the Nationals, who also traded first baseman Josh Bell, acquired MacKenzie Gore, a 23-year-old rookie who was among the sport's most promising pitchers, as well as a trio of notable prospects: shortstop CJ Abrams, outfielder James Wood and Robert Hassell III, a first round pick in 2020. Luke Voit, a veteran first baseman/designated hitter and Jarlin Susana, an 18-year-old pitcher, were also in the deal.\n“A lot of people at Baseball America who have experienced a lot more trades than me thought about this as one of the most impressive prospect hauls that we'd ever seen for a player,” said Carlos Collazo, who covers the Major League Baseball draft and minor league prospects for Baseball America.\nWASHINGTON - Billboards show players CJ Abrams and MacKenzie Gore at Nationals Park. (Photo by Shaun Chornobroff/Capital News Service)\nWeeks before the trade, Soto reportedly declined a contract worth 15 years and $440 million from the Nationals. The $29.3 million annual average on that contract would rank 20th all-time today, according to Spotrac.\nSoto will be a free agent this offseason and is expected to sign a contract worth at least $500 million, according to ESPN’s Jeff Passan. But, if it were up to Baumann, he’d still be in D.C.\n“I would have given him whatever he wanted,” Baumann said. “He is just such a hard player to replace, and particularly at that age.”\nIn the aftermath of the Soto trade, the Nationals finished 2022 with 55 wins and a .340 winning percentage — the franchise’s lowest since moving to Washington — and last in the NL East for the third consecutive season.\nIn those seasons the Nationals had a winning percentage of .380, the lowest all time for an MLB team in the three years following a championship.\n!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r=0;r\nA lack of spending\nIn the years leading up to the World Series title, the Nationals were among the league’s biggest spenders, according to Spotrac, a website that tracks professional sports spending and contracts.\nIn both 2015 and 2018, Washington had the fifth-highest player payroll in the MLB. The following two years, they had the seventh-highest payroll.\nAfter the World Series and the pandemic, there was a shift. The Nationals were shedding contracts via trade but not reinvesting in the team.\nThe Nationals dipped to 13th in spending in the MLB in 2021 and fell to 25th in 2023 before sitting at 24th this past season.\n“I’m surprised they weren’t dead last or second to last,” Kopf said.\n!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r=0;r\nA better tomorrow? \nAfter winning the World Series, the Nationals not only did not spend, but also lacked young impact players.\nRizzo tried to fix that with the barrage of trades in 2021, but the team has only seen a marginal payoff. Pitcher Josiah Gray, an All-Star in 2023, and catcher Keibert Ruiz — both acquired from the Dodgers in the Turner and Scherzer trade — have shown glimpses of being great players, but have lacked the consistency to realize their potential.\nThe Nationals won 71 games and had a .438 winning percentage for the second straight year in 2024, but avoided the NL East’s basement for the first time since winning the World Series. A major reason is the players received from the Soto trade.\nGore has struggled with consistency, but has been incredible in spurts.\nThrough May, the 25-year-old lefty had a 2.91 ERA before seeing that number skyrocket in June and July. September has been Gore’s best, as he posted a 1.26 ERA in the season’s final month.\nAbrams was named an All-Star this season after hitting 15 home runs, stealing 15 bases and accruing an .831 on-base plus slugging percentage in the first half of the season.\nThe 23-year-old shortstop was significantly less productive in the second half of the season.\nAbrams was demoted to the minor leagues on Sept. 21, the day after Cody Delmendo of CHGO, a Chicago centric sports outlet, reported that Abrams was out at a casino all night, returning only hours before the team’s afternoon game against the Chicago Cubs. When asked, Nationals Manager Dave Martinez said Abrams was demoted due to an internal issue and declined to give media more specifics.\nWood could end up being a superstar. A 6-foot-7, 234-pound outfielder with the ability to be among the game’s fastest players is a rarity.\n“My oldest daughter already knows who he is and could pick him out of a lineup,” Kopf said.\nWood made his major league debut in July and had a .265 batting average with a .354 on-base percentage, with seven home runs and 41 RBIs in 79 games this season.\nIn addition to the talent from the Soto trade, Dylan Crews, the No. 2 selection in the 2023 draft, dashed through the minors and made his debut on Aug. 26. He was named the organization’s minor league hitter of the year this year. He hit .270 with six triples, 13 home runs and 68 RBIs across Double and Triple-A before being called up to the majors.\n“I think (the Nationals) are one of the more intriguing teams,” Collazo said. “Just given the quantity and quality of young, big-league talent they have that can take steps forward over the next few years.”\nSince the elation of 2019, it's been a historically rough go for the Nationals and for fans like Kopf, but after floundering for half a decade, there might be promise for the future.\n“There's a number of people to get excited about,” said Kopf, who tracks the progress of most of the team’s top prospects online. “Even beyond, (like) the Wood and the Crews, there's some people in the minors that are going to be good in a few years.”"

    "title": "Chesapeake Bay is cleaner but will miss 2025 pollution targets, EPA, Maryland lawmakers say",
    "content": "WASHINGTON — Chesapeake Bay is cleaner than it used to be but is falling short of 2025 targets for reducing pollution, federal and state officials and most of Maryland’s congressional delegation said on Wednesday.\n“The short version is that its going in the right direction. The longer story is that were still behind,” Adam Ortiz, administrator for the Environmental Protection Agency’s Mid-Atlantic region, said at a Capitol Hill press conference.\nThe bay failed to meet the agreement’s main target, known as the total maximum daily load, which measures the total pollution in the Chesapeake Bay, Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Maryland, said.\n“The point of the 10-year plan is to create a pollution diet to reduce the amount of phosphorous, nitrogen and other pollutants in the bay,” Van Hollen said. “Thats a measurable target. Thats how we know we’re not going to hit it this year, so we need to redouble our efforts.”\nDespite missing the targets set in 2014 through 2025, Sen. Ben Cardin, D-Maryland, said he remained hopeful that the delegation can work together with experts at the EPA and other agencies to ensure the bays health continues to improve.\nMaryland Democratic Reps. Steny Hoyer, Dutch Ruppersberger, Kweisi Mfume and Jamie Raskin joined Cardin, Van Hollen, representatives from the EPA and the Maryland Department of Natural Resources.\nThe University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science gave the Chesapeake Bay an overall grade of a C+ in July, the highest grade the bay has received since 2002.\n“I know that nobody would be thrilled with bringing home a grade of a C+, but the fact of the matter is, it is the highest grade weve seen in a long time,” Van Hollen said. “We all want to do better, but I do want to stress that without the collective effort we see today, the bay would have died a long time ago.”\nThe Chesapeake Executive Council signed the Chesapeake Bay Watershed Agreement in 2014 and established five strategies for the restoration and protection of the bay, its tributaries and surrounding lands.\nLocal, state and federal governments are required to enact the plan’s management strategies and work with academic institutions, nongovernmental organizations, watershed groups and businesses and individuals, according to the 2014 agreement.\n“You need cooperation between the federal government and the states, among the states, among state governments and private industry,” said Van Hollen. “There are all sorts of sources of pollution today, and so we need to make sure everybody cooperates in producing pollution reduction.”\nOrtiz said that groups committed to improving the bay were in disarray when President Joe Biden’s administration began almost four years ago.\n“The states were suing the federal government, and states were pointing the fingers at each other for not making…progress,” he said.\nBut since then, he said, the EPA has been able to bring the states together and hold them accountable.\n“The Chesapeake Bay isn’t just a bay,” Cardin said. “The Chesapeake Bay has been one of the highest priorities for our Maryland congressional delegation. We’ve been focused on not only preserving but expanding our role and partnership with states, local governments and stakeholders.”\nVan Hollen emphasized the importance of identifying “measurable targets” of pollution reduction for long-term success, especially as climate change concerns surrounding the bay grow.\n“I think well have to have a discussion about what the length of time for the next agreement should be. It may make sense to look at shorter time horizons,” the senator said.  “But you have to have a measurable target to hold people down.”"

    "title": "Black Maryland medic honored with Distinguished Service Cross for D-Day heroism",
    "content": "WASHINGTON – Before his landing craft reached Omaha Beach in Normandy on D-Day, 21 year-old Army Cpl. Waverly Woodson Jr., a combat medic, was injured by intense shell fire.\nHis shrapnel wounds quickly dressed, Woodson worked tirelessly for 30 hours to save the lives of an estimated 200 soldiers as German shots and shellfire raked the crowded sand.\nOn Tuesday, Woodson received posthumous recognition for his actions on that day in June 1944 after decades of advocacy from his family. The Army honored Woodson, who lived in Clarksburg, Maryland, after the war, with the Distinguished Service Cross, the highest honor the Army can bestow on its own authority, in a ceremony on Capitol Hill.\nThe medal was laid on Omaha Beach before being presented to his widow, Joann Woodson, now 95.\nHis son, Stephen Woodson, 66, said this award has given the family closure.\n“All throughout the years, my dad never really complained about never being honored for what he had done, he considered that to be his duty,” Stephen Woodson said. “To have him receive an honor of this stature is just absolutely incredible.\nThe family has fought tirelessly for over 20 years for Woodson to be recognized for his devotion to duty on D-Day. Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Maryland, joined the effort in 2015.\n“Weve been working to right this wrong,” Van Hollen said. “This is an example of people coming together to help make our country strong.”\nBut Woodson’s bravery, as his family and Van Hollen argue, merits even more. The senator and Woodson’s family have campaigned for years to push for the veteran to receive the Congressional Medal of Honor.\nWoodson was recommended for the Medal of Honor after his service in World War II, but the honor was never bestowed. Woodson left the service in 1952, eventually rising to the rank of staff sergeant.\nVan Hollen told the packed audience at Tuesday’s ceremony that there is only one reason Woodson was denied the honor: the color of his skin.\nWoodson was a member of the 320th Barrage Balloon Battalion, the only all-Black battalion to storm the Normandy beaches during Operation Overlord, the massive Allied assault on German defenses along Frances Normandy coast.\nNo Black soldiers who served in World War II were given the Medal of Honor until 1997, when seven servicemen were finally recognized for the honor. By that time, Woodson’s crucial military paperwork was destroyed in a 1973 fire at the National Personnel Records Center in Overland, Missouri.\nWithout that crucial paperwork, the Army determined that there was not enough evidence to upgrade Woodson’s honors.\nIt wasn’t until the work of historian and journalist Linda Hervieux, who wrote the book “Forgotten: The Untold Story of D-Days Black Heroes, at Home and at War,” gained popularity that the Army took notice.\nCapt. Kevin Braafladt, First Army Support Command historian, took up where Hervieux left off to uncover enough evidence of Woodson’s service to open the door for the Distinguished Service Cross and, as the Woodson family hopes, may eventually allow for Woodson to receive the Medal of Honor.\n“Many of us thought this day would never come,” Hervieux said. “Its very hard to write history. Its very hard to give the Army the proof that it wants. Its nice to know as a reporter, sometimes you can do something that makes a difference.”\nWoodson didn’t talk about his experiences in the Army until 1994, the 50th anniversary of D-Day. The French government had sponsored a trip for Woodson and his wife, Joann, to visit Normandy.\n“I was wondering how he was going to take it, you know, to be walking right back over the ground where there was so much fighting and everything,” Joann Woodson said.\nThe trip was emotional, she said. Her husband was surprised to receive such a recognition from the French government who, she remembers him saying, paid more attention than the Americans did.\nIt was hard for his father to speak about D-Day with anyone, including his own son.\nIn the few instances Waverly Woodson talked about the beaches of Normandy, his son recalled, one story was always repeated more than any acknowledgement of the hundreds of people he saved.\nWhen his father got to shore, Stephen Woodson said, there was one soldier calling out for a doctor. The soldier was dying quickly, his body blown in half.\n“My dad could do nothing for him, other than console him,” Stephen Woodson said.\nWoodson stayed with the soldier and performed last rites.\n“That is the most emotional thing that he talked about in all of D-Day,” Stephen Woodson said.\nHis father never sought recognition and never talked about how he was overlooked, Stephen Woodson said. Instead, his son said, he was driven to save lives.\nAfter the war, Woodson and his family moved to Clarksburg from their home state of Pennsylvania.\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, Stephen Woodson said, there were very few doctors in the area open to serving Black patients. His father stepped in to help once again.\nAffectionately called “Doc Woodson,” Waverly Woodson would perform medical checkups for families who lived nearby.\nWhile he was never able to become a licensed physician due to limited medical school options for Black Americans, Woodson with his strong medical experience and training in the Army was able to provide medical care for dozens of families.\nWoodson died in 2005 at the age of 83.\nAlthough he did not live to see his service properly recognized, his widow said her husband would have loved an event – with family and friends mingling – like the ceremony that was held on Tuesday.\n“He was so good to everybody,” Joann Woodson said. “Our house was always open to all of the family. So if he were here, hed love this.”\nAs Army Lt. Gen. Mark Landes looked at a photo of Woodson, propped up next to him at the Capitol Hill ceremony, he said that Woodson embodied “the greatest legacy of our Army and our nation: ordinary Americans who become extraordinary.”\n“For the better part of eight decades, his contributions to one of the most iconic operations of modern military history, D-Day, have remained unrecognized and forgotten,” Landes said. “It may have remained unsung for far too long, but a legacy it still is.”\nStephen Woodson said his father is living through him and the rest of the family every day.\n“He deserved to know what his country thinks of him,” Stephen Woodson said. “Even 80 years later, hes smiling down on us right now.”"

    "title": "Senators, witnesses argue over the impact of Supreme Court’s presidential immunity ruling",
    "content": "WASHINGTON – Senate Judiciary Committee members Tuesday quarreled during a hearing over the implications of the Supreme Court’s July presidential immunity decision and Democrats’ criticism of the ruling.\n“Questioning the ethics of the Supreme Court is our responsibility under the Constitution, Article III,” said Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Illinois, and chairman of the panel. “I think we should continue to do that and not be questioned on our motives.”\nHis Republican colleagues questioned the purpose of the hearing, six weeks before the presidential election in which former President Donald Trump’s legal woes have been one of the underlying story lines.\nThe Supreme Court two months ago delivered a landmark decision on presidential immunity in Trump v. United States, a case that focused on Trump’s actions related to the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol.\nThe court ruling divided presidential actions into three categories: core official duties which receive absolute immunity, all official duties which have at least presumptive immunity and unofficial acts which have no immunity from criminal prosecution.\nDemocrats attacked the decision, saying it could permit future presidents to be reckless without the underlying fear of criminal prosecution. Republicans countered that the decision could prevent politically-motivated revenge for a president’s actions in office.\nDurbin noted that when Chief Justice John Roberts testified at his confirmation hearing nearly two decades ago, he said: “No man is above the law  not the president and not the Congress.”\nBut the immunity decision Roberts penned was “a game-changing act of judicial fiat that puts all future presidents above the law, protecting them from criminal prosecution for abusing the authority given them for personal or political gain,” Durbin said.\nRepublican senators and their two witnesses repeatedly characterized the immunity opinion as unremarkable and the hearing as a politically motivated attack on the conservative-dominated Supreme Court.\n“This hearing is not about righting a wrong,” said South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, the judiciary panel’s top Republican. “This hearing is about a continued narrative. Its about delegitimizing a court that you don’t like.”\nRepublicans repeated their claims that the Democrats are weaponizing the Justice Department against Trump, the only former president to have been criminally indicted.\nSen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and other GOP senators listed actions by Democratic presidents as examples of instances in which the justice system could have gone after former chief executives if presidential immunity wasn’t understood, such as the internments of Japanese and Japanese Americans ordered by then-President Franklin Roosevelt during World War II.\nFormer Attorney General Michael Mukasey, who served under President George W. Bush, said he worried that the presidency would be whittled away without the immunity decision. Sen. Peter Welch, D-Vermont, responded: “My concern is rule law is being whittled away.”\n“My concern is that constitutional freedoms are in the process of being whittled away,” Welch continued. “Whats been whittled away are the checks and balances that are the core of our constitutional system.”\nFormer Deputy Solicitor General Philip Allen Lacovara, who was a counsel to the special prosecutor in the Watergate investigation of President Richard Nixon, told senators that there is no historical justification for presidential immunity for official acts.\n“I have no interest in attacking the court as an institution,” Lacovara said. “Rather, what Im trying to suggest is that the court in this decision, at least, has brought criticism on itself.”\n“The decision is profoundly wrong and it is profoundly dangerous,” he said, noting the majority on the court could find no precedent to buttress its ruling.\nIn addition to Nixon, Presidents Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton were all at some point under criminal investigation, Lacovara said. Before 2024, Lacovara told the senators, no serious lawyer or president claimed that there was immunity for crimes committed in office, including crimes committed while performing an official function.\nIf the July Supreme Court decision was in place before the Watergate scandal, Lacavera told Capital News Service, there would have been no need for President Gerald Ford to pardon Nixon.\n“The potential abuses of official power that are made possible by the court’s ruling and the neutering of Congress’ ability to act are alarming,” said Mary McCord, executive director of Georgetown University’s Institute for Constitutional Advocacy and Protection. She served as acting assistant attorney general for national security affairs under President Barack Obama and into the early months of the Trump presidency.\nNixon directed a census of Jews in government in 1971, an action that illustrated “the corrosive and dangerous capacity of unchecked presidential power,” warned Dr. Timothy Naftali, a presidential historian who also served as the first federal director of the Richard M. Nixon Presidential Library and Museum.\n“Motives do matter in the application of constitutional authority and…presidents ought to be held accountable, if appropriate, by the courts as well as the Congress for the motives that animate their decisions,” Naftali said.\nDemocrats in Congress have attempted to respond to the immunity decision through a series of court reform proposals and immunity-focused legislation, none of which have made significant legislative progress.\n\nThe Biden administration unveiled a Supreme Court ethics reform package in July, a response to the presidential immunity decision, the decision to reverse Roe v. Wade and other recent opinions."

    "title": "Senators grill Novo Nordisk CEO about high costs of weight loss drugs",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  Senators questioned the head of Novo Nordisk in a hearing Tuesday about the prices of the company’s diabetes and weight-loss medications.\nDuring the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee hearing, the chairman, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vermont, said that Novo Nordisk charges more for Wegovy and Ozempic in the United States than in other countries.\nSanders said he has received commitments from major pharmacy benefit managers that they would be able to expand their coverage of Wegovy and Ozempic if Novo Nordisk substantially reduces the list price of the medications.\nLars Fruergaard Jørgensen, the president and CEO of the Danish pharmaceutical company, fielded questions about the high price of the drugs.\nOzempic, a drug used to treat diabetes, is listed in the U.S. at $969 per month, according to Sanders. In Germany, it is sold for just $59, he said. Wegovy, a weight-loss drug, costs $1,349 per month in the U.S. and $137 in Germany, Sanders continued.\n“Treat the American people the same way that you treat people all over the world,” Sanders said to Jørgensen. “Stop ripping us off.”\nOther committee members echoed Sanders’ probing.\n“Why are we so out of align with the rest of the world in terms of the pricing that comes from the industry?” Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, asked.\nJørgensen said the data is not comparable among countries and that 80% of Americans with insurance have access to the medications at $25 per month. Novo Nordisk also has a patient assistance program to help qualifying low-income patients afford the drugs.\nThe list price of the drugs is a starting point for negotiations with insurance companies, Jørgensen told the committee.\n“It is not our intention that anyone should pay the list price,” he responded to Sanders.\nGLP-1 medications, which help regulate blood sugar and appetite, could save thousands of lives each year if they were sold at a more affordable price, Sanders said.\nOzempic and Wegovy sales have surged in recent years, according to data from Pew Research Center, a Washington-based nonpartisan think tank.\nSince 2018, Novo Nordisk has made nearly $50 billion in sales from the two drugs and is a “cash cow,” Sanders said.\nSen. Maggie Hassan, D-New Hampshire, and Sanders pressed Jørgensen on whether he would commit to lowering the list prices of Ozempic and Wegovy.\nRepresentatives of the country’s top three pharmacy benefits managers — Cigna Healthcare’s Express Scripts, UnitedHealth Group’s OptumRx and CVS Health’s Caremark — told committee members they expect Novo Nordisk lowering list prices would lead to expanded access to the drugs, Hassan said.\nJørgensen said he would work with the committee and pharmacy benefit managers to negotiate lowering costs.\n“Ill be happy to collaborate with them on this, because anything that helps patients to get access and affordability, we are supportive of,” Jørgensen said."

    "content": "WASHINGTON – Nine Maryland lawmakers wrote a letter earlier this week to NASA demanding answers regarding the agency’s termination of a multi-billion dollar spacecraft program.\nThe project, known as OSAM-1, was developed at the Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, and was expected to service existing satellites and expand their lifespans in space.\n“NASA Goddard’s OSAM-1 has the potential to offer an innovative solution for extending the lifespans of our satellites while keeping them in orbit,” Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Maryland, said in a statement to Capital News Service. “Despite Team Maryland’s efforts to preserve this important mission and renewed work at Goddard to keep it on track for a 2026 launch, NASA has decided to move forward on canceling this program. Given the abrupt nature of this decision and the lack of a sufficient explanation to Congress as to why it was made, we’re seeking immediate answers from NASA.”\nThe lawmakers letter, dated Sept. 16 and addressed to NASA Administrator Bill Nelson, was signed by Van Hollen and fellow Democratic Sen. Ben Cardin, as well as Democratic Reps. Steny Hoyer, Glenn Ivey, Dutch Ruppersberger, Jamie Raskin, Kweisi Mfume, David Trone and John Sarbanes.\nRep. Andy Harris, the lone Republican in the Maryland congressional delegation, was the only state lawmaker not on the letter. Harris did not respond to Capital News Service’s request for comment.\nThe United States currently has no technology that offers the services and quality that OSAM-1 was supposed to provide, according to the letter.\n“We do have adversaries who are also operating satellites in that zone: Russia, China and the like,” Ivey told CNS. “Its important for the United States to develop its capabilities with respect to whether its research or defensive applications that we might need.”\nIvey, who represents Maryland’s 4th District where the Goddard Space Flight Center is located, said ending the project would hurt many of his constituents.\n“From a district piece, this could mean the loss of hundreds of jobs, engineers, scientists, the backbone of the research quadrant that we have up there in that part of Prince Georges County,” he said. “Theres 10,000 employees up there at NASA Goddard. We also have other assets that leverage what they do.”\nSince its start in 2015, the project has suffered substantial cost increases and delays.\nOn March 1, NASA announced a shutdown of the mission.\n“Following an in-depth, independent project review, NASA has decided to discontinue the On-orbit Servicing, Assembly, and Manufacturing 1 (OSAM-1) project due to continued technical, cost, and schedule challenges, and a broader community evolution away from refueling unprepared spacecraft, which has led to a lack of a committed partner,” NASA said in a statement.\nNevertheless, Congress provided $227 million for OSAM-1 in the 2024 fiscal year budget and aimed for the spacecrafts launch in 2026.\nThe letter said that in April NASA received an updated plan that met both Congress’ launch and budget requirements. However, on Sept. 4, members of the Maryland delegation were made aware of NASA’s decision to proceed with canceling OSAM-1.\nWe are currently witnessing a commercial boom in space launches, and it is critical that NASA commits to the priority of controlling the growth of orbital debris, especially during a time when private actors may not feel incentivized to do so,” the lawmakers wrote.\nThe lawmakers added that some of the criteria NASA used to cancel the satellite were not based on congressional directives.\n“We have concerns regarding the Agency’s decision-making process,” they wrote.\nThe delegation set a deadline of Monday — one week after the letter was dated — for NASA to respond.\n“The bottom line of the request is, give us a scientific explanation for why youve done what youve done here,” Ivey said. “Why have you called for this to terminate?”\nNASA confirmed to CNS that it received the letter and will respond directly to the Maryland delegation, but did not respond when asked if the agency would meet the Monday deadline."

    "title": "Experts see AI contributing to election misinformation with little federal government response",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  As millions of Americans prepare to cast their ballots in the election, the federal government has done little to mitigate public fears surrounding the potential influence of artificial intelligence (AI) deepfakes.\nDespite multiple bipartisan bills being introduced in both the Senate and the House, Congress has yet to enact any legislation and is unlikely to do so before the election. \n“Those tools are being used to mislead voters about elections and spread falsehoods about candidates,” Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Connecticut, said on Tuesday during an AI-focused hearing by the Senate Judiciary Committees privacy, technology, and the law subcommittee. Blumenthal chairs the panel.  \nAn Elon University survey in May found that more than three-quarters of Americans believe AI abuses will affect the outcome of the presidential election.\nCapital News Service talked to multiple experts in AI and politics who explained that, while there are concerns surrounding AI, the evolving technology changing the outcome of elections is not among them. \n“Will AI potentially convince some voters to vote for one candidate instead of another? Maybe,” said Dr. Keegan McBride, an AI, government and policy expert at the Oxford Internet Institute at the University of Oxford. “Will they be able to convince a couple hundred thousand voters in Pennsylvania that they should vote for candidate A instead of Candidate B? Probably not.”\nAI has already made its presence known in the 2024 presidential election cycle. \nIn June 2023, a video shared by the campaign team for one-time Republican presidential candidate and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis showed a fake photo of former President Donald Trump hugging Dr. Anthony Fauci, the former director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and former chief medical advisor to the president. \nTrump also posted AI images on Truth Social in August of singer Taylor Swift and her fans supposedly endorsing him. Swift endorsed Democratic nominee Kamala Harris after the Sept. 10 debate between Harris and Trump. \nMost notably, robocalls in New Hampshire impersonated President Joe Biden and discouraged citizens from voting in the state’s January primary. Steven Kramer, a political consultant, admitted to masterminding the plan and is facing 26 criminal charges, as well as a $6 million fine from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC).\nThe agency ruled on Feb. 8 that AI-generated voices used in robocalls are illegal.\nWere putting the fraudsters behind these robocalls on notice, said FCC Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel. \nWhile these instances drew widespread coverage, Dr. Cody Buntain, an assistant professor at the University of Maryland’s College of Information, said the examples the public has seen thus far haven’t had the intended effect. \n“They’re notable because they weren’t convincing and no one bought them,” Buntain said. “Very quickly the country and the news media jumped on them, said ‘this is totally not legit,’ and we’ve sort of all agreed with that.” \nWhile swaying the results of the election was not a prevalent concern with any of the experts, each said AI has the potential to fuel further public distrust of government and the political system.\nPeter Loge, the founding director of the Project on Ethics in Political Communication at The George Washington Universitys School of Media and Public Affairs, has more than three decades of experience in politics. When he first started out in the industry, campaigns were cutting and pasting images. That changed when Photoshop became popular. “It was cutting and pasting, but way better and faster,” said Loge. \nGenerative AI is the latest evolution, he said. \n“Its easier to generate garbage than ever before, and its easier to circulate garbage than ever before,” Loge said. “Making up stuff about your opponents, making up news stories, doctoring photographs, deepfakes  lies arent new.”\nFor decades, trust in the federal government has been eroding. In 1964, 77% of people said they trusted the government, according to the Pew Research Center. Sixty years later, that number sits at 22%. \nThe inability to distinguish truth from generative AI has the potential to exacerbate this trend, multiple experts said. \nOn Aug. 7, Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, held a rally in Detroit, Michigan, where a photo of an estimated 15,000-person crowd circulated on social media. Four days later, Trump said on Truth Social that the photos were AI-generated. \nThe photo was authentic, but Loge believes that Trump’s false AI claim represents a major problem. \n“You get to claim that the real is fake because everybody believes that everythings being faked anyway, and that increases cynicism,” Loge said. ”It decreases confidence in campaigns and democracy, all of which is very bad.”\nIn lieu of federal legislation regarding AI and the election, individual states have sought to address the matter. At least 19 states have passed laws since 2019 regulating the use of AI in political messaging, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.\nIn Maryland, six state lawmakers in February proposed legislation requiring campaigns to disclose the use of artificial intelligence for political materials. \nThe bill, which was similar to those passed in a number of other states, saw no action in this year’s legislative session.\n“We need a disclosure if there’s an image. We need a disclosure if there’s media. We need a disclosure if there’s audio,” Del. Anne Kaiser, D-Montgomery County, said during a Feb. 27 committee hearing. “This bill would codify Maryland’s election law.” \nWith the Congress scheduled to go on an election break next week, it’s becoming increasingly likely that there will be more consequence-free AI ads and deepfakes before Election Day. \nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, R-Louisiana, told Axios on Thursday that he wants Congress to adopt a laissez-faire approach to AI for the time being.\nWe got to build consensus on what the right approach is, but I think youll see a lot of emphasis on that in the first quarter of next year, Johnson said.\nWhile AI is unlikely to influence the result of the election, Buntain did offer a potential doomsday scenario come November if the vote tally is close. \n“If people are uncertain about the outcome of the election, and theres a certain cohort of the population who already dont have a lot of trust in the electoral process,” he said, “then the use of AI In particular manipulated imagery has a much more risky potential to at least get people out into the streets and stir up feelings of anger and resentment and mobilize people.”"

    "title": "Maryland ballot drop boxes installed as vote-by-mail deadlines approach",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  The Maryland State Board of Elections completed the installation Wednesday of 286 ballot drop boxes across the state for the general election.\nMarylanders can use any drop box to cast their mail-in ballots, which may arrive in homes as early as next week.\n“What you see now is a huge shift towards mail-in voting,” Maryland’s State Administrator of Elections Jared DeMarinis told Capital News Service.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic led to a significant expansion of mail-in voting in Maryland. During lockdown, the state sent all eligible voters mail-in ballots for the 2020 primary election. In that election, 97 percent of ballots were cast by mail.\nAlthough the share of ballots cast by mail diminished as voters returned to the polls in 2022 and the 2024 primary, mail-in voting remains far more popular than it was before the pandemic. And according to DeMarinis, it’s here to stay.\n“It looks like, from those past three statewide elections, post-COVID, that its something that Marylanders have liked and are going to use,” DeMarinis said, referring to the 2022 primary and general elections as well as this year’s primary. “And I think they see that mail-in voting offers flexibility to a lot of people. They get to choose when they want to vote.”\n\nMarylanders can mark the calendar for upcoming deadlines to vote by mail in the general election.\nMonday, Sept. 23:Ballots begin to arrive in the mail for permanent mail-in voters\nMaryland provides the option for all voters who request a mail-in ballot to voluntarily join a permanent mail-in ballot list. \nThose who have opted in to the permanent mail-in ballot list can expect to see ballots arriving in the mail as early as Monday. Ballots may be returned by mail or dropped off at a drop box or a board of elections office as soon as ballots are completed.\nTuesday, Oct. 15: Deadline to register to vote for those voting by mail\nWhile Maryland has same-day registration for voters who cast their ballots in person at a polling place, those who plan to vote by mail must register in advance either online or by mail.\nFor online registration, visit the Maryland State Board of Elections website to register to vote for the first time or update an existing registration if a name, address or political party affiliation has changed.\nFor registration by mail, print and complete a voter registration application, then mail it to a local board of elections.\nThose not sure of their registration status can check online to see the current registration information and ballot drop box locations in each county.\nTuesday, Oct. 29: Deadline to request a mail-in ballot to be delivered by mail\nVoters must fill out a form to request a ballot in the mail. Maryland is not an “all-mail” jurisdiction, like the District of Columbia, which sends every eligible voter a ballot.\nThe form to request a mail-in ballot can be found online. Print, complete and mail the application to a local board of elections office.\nVoters also may visit a local board of elections office by the deadline to request a mail-in ballot.\nFriday, Nov. 1: Deadline to request a mail-in ballot to be delivered online\nFill out this form online to request that a mail-in ballot to be delivered via email. The ballot still must be physically mailed in or taken to a drop box.\nTuesday, Nov. 5: Election Day and deadline to complete and return mail-in ballots\nCompleted ballots can be either mailed to a board of elections office, handed in at a board of elections office, or dropped in an official ballot drop box. On Election Day and during early voting hours, ballots also can be turned in at a polling place.\nBallots must be postmarked or dropped off by the close of polls at 8 p.m. on Nov. 5.\nTwenty-five boards of elections offices manage voting across the state in Annapolis, Baltimore City and all 23 counties. The Maryland State Board of Elections is located at 151 West Street, Suite 200, Annapolis, MD 21401. Check online for the location and hours of local board of elections offices.\nDeMarinis said that a common mistake that Maryland voters make on mail-in ballots, especially those voting by mail for the first time, is forgetting to sign the oath on the envelope containing the completed ballot. In that case, the State Board of Elections will contact the voter to provide the opportunity to sign the ballot before the count is concluded.\nQuestions about voting can be directed to the Maryland State Board of Elections at 410-269-2840. The state board is open Monday through Friday from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m."

    "title": "Justice Department sues ship companies for $100M in Baltimore&#8217;s Key Bridge cleanup",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  The Department of Justice filed a lawsuit Wednesday against the owner and the operator of the ship that collided with the Francis Scott Key Bridge in March, asking for more than $100 million to recoup the cost of extensive cleanup efforts to reopen the Fort McHenry Channel.\nThe DOJ asserted that the companies’ conduct in sending the container ship Dali down the Patapsco River was “outrageous, grossly negligent, willful, wanton, and reckless.”\nThe suit claimed that “the Dali got underway with known unseaworthy conditions in confined waters where a ship of its magnitude had every opportunity to cause catastrophic damage and loss of life, which in fact happened.”\nThe defendants in the civil suit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland, are the Singapore-based corporations Grace Ocean Private Limited, which owned the Dali, and Synergy Marine Private Limited, the Dali’s operator.\nRepresentatives for the companies did not respond to requests for comment.\nThe bridge collapse resulted in the death of six road workers and impeded operations in the Port of Baltimore until the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and U.S. Navy Supervisor of Salvage and Diving completed the cleanup in June.\n“The Justice Department is committed to ensuring accountability for those responsible for the destruction of the Francis Scott Key Bridge, which resulted in the tragic deaths of six people and disrupted our country’s transportation and defense infrastructure,” Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement.\nThis suit from the DOJ is a response to Grace Ocean and Synergy’s petition to the court in April “for exoneration from or limitation of liability” for damages resulting from the collision. In that claim, the companies asked that their liability be limited to $43.67 million for the damage to the ship and its cargo.\nIn the 53-page filing Wednesday, the DOJ detailed a litany of mechanical and electrical flaws in the Dali that led to collision with the bridge. The suit alleges that Grace Ocean and Synergy were aware of these issues and that Dali’s crew mishandled the ships approach to the bridge after two power outages occured in the early hours of March 26.\n“This was an entirely avoidable catastrophe, resulting from a series of eminently foreseeable errors made by the owner and operator of the Dali,” Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Brian Boynton said in a statement.\nOn Tuesday, families of the victims of the bridge collapse announced at a press conference they will be filing their own legal claim to hold the owner of the Dali liable. The six men were immigrant workers from Latin America and their deaths contributed to a national conversation about the rights of immigrants in the United States, who often perform essential labor.\nGustavo Torres, executive director of CASA de Maryland, an immigrant advocacy organization, spoke at the press conference in support of the victims and their families.\nTorres accused Grace Ocean of trying to “wash their hands of responsibility for these lives lost.”\nCarmen Luna, whose husband Miguel Luna was killed in the collapse, said she’s seeking justice not just for her family but for the families of all immigrant workers.\n“Real justice means no son has to miss their father. No wife has to navigate this world alone. And no grandchild has to know their grandfather through a distant picture,” said Luna through a translator.\nThe rebuild of the Key Bridge is expected to begin in 2025 and be completed in 2028.\nIn April, Maryland lawmakers introduced the Baltimore BRIDGE Relief Act in Congress, asking the federal government to cover the cost of rebuilding. The measure is sitting in committees in both the House and Senate, with no movement in the past five months.\nSen. Ben Cardin, D-Maryland, told reporters Tuesday that the state’s lawmakers are hoping to include authorization for federal funds for the bridge in a stopgap spending bill still being negotiated on Capitol Hill."

    "title": "Nail-driving ceremony marks start of construction on Capitol inauguration platform",
    "content": "WASHINGTON – The six members of the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies (JCCIC) on Wednesday struck the first nails into what will eventually be a structure on the west front of the United States Capitol that will hold nearly 1,600 people for the inauguration of the nation’s next president on Jan. 20.\n“This platform will serve as a stage for a momentous occasion where we will celebrate our democracy and the sacred values that tie us together as a nation,” Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minnesota, and a committee member, said. “It is here that we will pause to reaffirm that ours is, and always will be a government of, by and for the people. We will stand here united in support of the resilient democracy for generations to come.”\nMoments later, the members of the bipartisan and bicameral committee bowed their heads, eyes shut, over a makeshift plywood work table on which the structure for the 60th inaugural ceremonies will be built. \nUnited States Senate Chaplain Barry Black thanked workers involved in building the platform for the inauguration of the 47th president, more than a dozen of whom stood behind him in neon construction vests and hard hats, as he concluded the traditional “first nail” ceremony.\n“Give the workers on this important project strength for the challenges and the satisfaction that in their work they are contributing to the price of freedom,” Black said. \nSlightly more than four months from now, former presidents, senators, representatives, Supreme Court justices and special guests will walk out onto the platform on the Capitol’s west front overlooking the National Mall and watch power peacefully transition from President Joe Biden to his successor.\nThe JCCIC, responsible for the planning and execution of the inaugural ceremonies, praised the workers and staff responsible for accomplishing an impressive architectural feat every four years.\n“These workers literally set the stage for the peaceful transition of power,” Klobuchar, chairwoman of the committee, said. “We thank you for your commitment in writing the next chapter in our countrys history.”\nAccording to Architect of the Capitol Thomas Austin, the inauguration stage requires more than a year of planning and six months to build.\nAdditionally, construction of the platform calls for “more than a half a million nails, and enough board feet of lumber that if laid end-to-end, it would stretch from here to Fort Meade in Maryland,” Austin said. “But lumber and nails are just part of this story, because almost every skill represented in the Office of the Architect (of the Capitol) has a role in each inauguration.”\nSince Ronald Reagan’s 1981 inauguration, the swearing-in ceremonies have taken place on the Capitol’s west front. The one exception was Reagan’s 1985 ceremonies, which were moved into the Rotunda due to extremely cold temperatures. \nIn 2021, Biden was sworn in as the 46th president amidst the COVID-19 pandemic and in the wake of former president Donald Trump’s attempts to overturn the election and the attacks on the Capitol during the Jan. 6 insurrection.\n“If you really look at it, the measure of someones commitment to democracy is not that they got power, but they were willing to give up power,” Jane Campbell, president and CEO of the United States Capitol Historical Society, said. “People who cling to power do not send democracy in a wonderful move forward. Thats why January 6 was so tragic for this country.”\nCampbell, the first woman elected mayor of Cleveland, Ohio, said that the 2025 inauguration is vital in signaling that this country does in fact carry out a peaceful transition of power. \nThe first nail ceremony’s backdrop was shrink-wrapped pallets of construction material that will transform the west front over the next 124 days. \n“Today marks a momentous step in our preparation for next years inauguration,” Klobuchar said. “While there is a lot of work ahead, I know that together, we will rise to this historic occasion as we have time and time again and ensure that the American experiment lives on.”\nIn addition to Klobuchar, the inaugural ceremonies committee members are Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-New York; House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-Louisiana; Sen. Deb Fischer, R-Nebraska; House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-Louisiana, and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-New York."

    "title": "Maryland Rep. Andy Harris to lead House Freedom Caucus",
    "content": "WASHINGTON – Rep. Andy Harris, R-Maryland, is the new chairman of the House Freedom Caucus. \nHarris, who represents Maryland’s Eastern Shore and is the state’s only Republican in Congress, is a founding member of the Freedom Caucus and was already serving on the right-wing caucus’s board of directors. \n“I look forward to leading this caucus as we confront the reckless spending of the Biden-Harris Administration, work to secure our Southern Border, and defend our constitutional freedoms in the House of Representatives,” Harris said in a statement Wednesday. \nThe late Tuesday vote came after the former caucus head, Rep. Bob Good, R-Virginia, lost his June primary reelection bid, leading him to resign from his chairmanship position last week. Good was set to lead the House Freedom Caucus through December 2025. \nGood said on X that the chairmanship is in “capable hands,” referring to Harris’ election. \nSince the House Freedom Caucus was formed in 2015, its members have contributed to legislative chaos for Republican leadership. \nNotably, the caucus played a key role in the House leadership fight that ousted former Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-California, and brought in current Speaker Mike Johnson, R-Louisiana. \nHarris is a member of the House Appropriations Committee and serves as the committee’s chair of the agriculture subcommittee. \nHis role on appropriations – the committee tasked with deciding spending for most of the government – and his new chairmanship is a win for the House Freedom Caucus, whose members say they want to limit government spending. \n“In the annals of, ‘it could never happen,’ the House Freedom Caucus Chairman is also a cardinal on the House Appropriations Committee,” Former Freedom Caucus Chairman Rep. Scott Perry, R-Pennsylvania, wrote on X. “The @freedomcaucus continues to punch above its weight. Well done, Andy.”\nThe House Freedom Caucus is currently pushing to add conservative policies – including a measure that would require proof of citizenship to vote – to a temporary government funding bill. \nHarris’ new role may help in the Maryland congressional delegation’s efforts to secure full federal funding to rebuild Baltimore’s Francis Scott Key Bridge, which collapsed in March. \nBefore the chairmanship vote, Harris told reporters Tuesday that he wasn’t sure if the authorization for the bridge could be attached to the upcoming continuing resolution to fund the government. \nHowever, he said that because the authorization, if included, would be a part of a much larger bill, Republicans likely wouldn’t base their vote on the Key Bridge. \nSen. Ben Cardin, D-Maryland, said on Tuesday that Harris and the Maryland Democrats are helping in the House to get Key Bridge authorization through. Cardin told reporters that he is hopeful the authorization for the government to pay for the full repairs could be added to the continuing resolution. \nHarris’ stance wanting the government to pay for the full Key Bridge repair project differed from the Freedom Caucus, which wanted to first look for liabilities from shipping companies before approving government funds.   \nHarris has served in the House since 2011. Before Congress, Harris was a Maryland state senator for 12 years."

Ben Cardin will attend the 79th session of the United Nations General Assembly.\nCardin, a Democrat, will travel to New York this weekend as a representative of the United States to the U.N. to meet with world leaders, the senator said in an interview Tuesday with Capital News Service.\nCardin said his message to the General Assembly will include “support for Ukraine, put a spotlight on the Sudan – the tragedies that are taking place there – and to try to find a way in which we can move towards the hostage release, cease-fire and peace in the Middle East.” \n“We know its an incredible opportunity, in regards to Ukraine, were gonna have this week, and I expect to use that,” Cardin said.\nPresident Joe Biden announced his nominations for U.S. representatives to the U.N. on Sept. 9. Along with Cardin, Biden nominated Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, former Biden-Harris campaign official Tanya Leigh Flores and Michael Trager, vice chairman of the State Department’s Fulbright Foreign Scholarship Board.\n“Currently serving as chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Cardin has worked across party lines to further U.S. national security and to ensure that democracy, anti-corruption, transparency, good governance and respect for civil and human rights are integrated into American actions at home and abroad,” the White House said in a statement.\nCardin served as a U.S. representative to the U.N.

The assembly convenes once a year, and this year’s theme is “Leaving no one behind: acting together for the advancement of peace, sustainable development and human dignity for present and future generations.”\nMember states at the assembly will discuss a variety of issues, from rising sea levels to artificial intelligence and equitable financing for low-income countries.\n“Im honored to have President Bidens trust to represent our country at the United Nations General Assembly,” Cardin said in a tweet on Sept. 10. “Looking forward to productive, unifying conversations.”\nThe Senate has yet to vote to confirm the U.N. nominations but Cardin said his responsibilities were not “terribly contingent upon confirmation,” so he can join the delegation.\n“I have my credentials as United States senator, chairman of Senate Foreign Relations Committee,” he said. “Theres not any official action I will take, because I’m a member of our delegation. It’s just to work with our delegation. I dont have to give up my day job.”\nBiden has addressed the UN each fall of his presidency and Cardin expects him to address the body again next week."

    "title": "Larry Hogan&#8217;s record on LGBTQ+ issues criticized by Maryland legislators",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  Members of the Maryland Legislative LGBTQ+ Caucus are accusing former Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan of not standing up for the LGBTQ+ community.\nHogan, the Republican nominee for Maryland’s U.S. Senate seat, has proven he is not an ally to LGBTQ+ Marylanders, a statement from five members of the caucus reads. All are Democrats. Caucus members said it is critical that the Democratic candidate, Prince George’s County Executive Angela Alsobrooks, beats Hogan in November.\n“I see the indifference that Larry Hogan expresses and it causes me great pause,” Del. Kris Fair, D-Frederick County, told Capital News Service. “It should cause every LGBTQ+ community member great pause about his ability to support our community.”\nThe caucus spoke out after Hogan recently dismissed an LGBTQ+ Maryland voter’s concerns about his record at a campaign event, according to the statement and reporting from The Advocate.\nIn addition to Fair, who is the chair of the Maryland Legislative LGBTQ+ Caucus, the statement was signed by Del. Anne Kaiser, D-Montgomery County; Del. Joe Vogel, D-Montgomery County; Del. Ashanti Martinez, D-Prince George’s County; and Del. Bonnie Cullison, D-Montgomery County.\nDuring his time as governor, Hogan elected to not sign several LGBTQ+ rights bills, including one that protects victims from hate crimes based on their identity. Hogan did not veto or directly oppose the bill and it ended up becoming law without his signature.\nHogan choosing not to sign bills that would protect LGBTQ+ individuals indicated to Cullison that he doesn’t understand the challenges facing the community. LGBTQ+ people rely on laws to give them protections, she said.\n“For political reasons, he felt it was important that his name not be on those bills,” Cullison told CNS.\nIn 2018, Hogan signed a bill into law that bans conversion therapy for LGBTQ+ youth. Cullison — who was a leader in this effort — said it was “an easy one for him to sign.”\nAnti-conversion bills were already passing across the country and politics were on his side, she said. Since Hogan signed the bill, similar laws have been enacted in Utah, Virginia and Michigan.\n“He’s just been responsive,” she said. “He hasn’t been proactive.”\nMartinez thinks Hogan has been silent about the concerns of LGBTQ+ community members and that indicates how the former governor would act in the U.S. Senate if he is elected.\n“He decided not to sign these bills,” Martinez told CNS. “I think that’s a clear indication to LGBTQ folks and our allies across this state that he is not the champion that we know Angela Alsobrooks will be.”\nAs governor, Hogan allowed measures to take effect that extend coverage of IVF treatment to same-sex couples and allow transgender people to revise their birth certificates, Hogan campaign spokesperson Blake Kernen said in a statement to CNS. He also appointed the first openly LGBTQ+ person to serve as chief judge of a Maryland appellate court, Kernen wrote.\n“After calling for ‘tolerance and mutual respect’ in his inaugural address, Governor Hogan supported LGBTQ community priorities throughout his time in office,” she wrote. “Maryland has a bipartisan legacy of supporting the LGBTQ community, and Governor Hogan looks forward to building on this work in the Senate.”\nHogan walked in the Annapolis Pride Parade in June, sporting a Pride sticker and lei. His campaign posted on Facebook dozens of pictures of Hogan with attendees at the parade.\n“Maryland is a mosaic of diverse communities and cultures, and that’s one of many things that makes our great state so special,” Hogan said in a statement. “As governor, I was proud to represent all Marylanders, and that’s exactly the leader I’ll be in the United States Senate.”\nMartinez, a resident of Prince George’s County, said he has witnessed Alsobrooks supporting the LGBTQ+ community during her time as county executive. He appreciates that prominent members of her staff are part of the LGBTQ+ community.\nAlsobrooks has held listening sessions, attended Pride events and created an LGBTQ+ liaison position in her office, Martinez said.\n“It is really important that we have ourselves represented in all facets of government,” Martinez said.\nCullison agrees that Alsobrooks is the candidate for U.S. Senate that will stand with LGBTQ+ community members.\n“Angela Alsobrooks will be the senator who will fight the fight with us,” she said. “She’s supportive and advocates and won’t back down and won’t hide behind not signing something.”\nIf elected senator, Alsobrooks said she plans to co-sponsor the Equality Act — a bill that would prohibit discrimination on the basis of sex, sexual orientation and gender identity in public accommodations and facilities — and oppose Republican efforts to undermine equality, she wrote in a statement to CNS.\nThe Human Rights Campaign, an LGBTQ+ civil rights organization, endorsed Alsobrooks this summer.\n“What we understand is that this race in Maryland will likely decide whether Democrats or Republicans control the Senate Majority. Republicans have made it clear that no such votes to protect and elevate our LGBTQ+ community will come to the Floor if they take back the Majority,” Alsobrooks wrote in her statement.\nFair said that while Hogan may not propose bills that directly harm the LGBTQ+ community, he will likely allow other Republicans to do so.\n“Larry Hogan is the symptom of a problem coming down the road that’s going to be devastating for our community,” Fair said."

    "title": "Retiring Maryland Rep. Sarbanes says he will continue fighting for election reform",
    "content": "WASHINGTON – Rep. John Sarbanes, D-Maryland, is preparing to say goodbye to Capitol Hill, but he’s not done fighting for election reform. \n“Whether Im in this chamber as a lawmaker and a representative, or whether Im out in the country … as part of a broader democracy team, Im very focused on keeping up the fight,” Sarbanes told Capital News Service in an interview. \nSarbanes is the lead sponsor of the Freedom to Vote Act, a bill that aims to set national standards to remove barriers to vote and address campaign finance issues. \nThe bill would require all states to have at least two weeks of early voting, allow for same-day voter registration, permit over 20 document options for voter identification, adhere to new congressional redistricting standards and implement a national automatic voter registration system. \nSarbanes’ legislation would also establish Election Day as a federal holiday and make it a criminal offense to interfere with someone registering to vote. \nBefore the Freedom to Vote Act, Sarbanes was the lead sponsor of the similar For the People Act, which passed the then-Democrat-controlled House in 2021 and 2019. Senate Democrats unsuccessfully attempted to pass the bill in 2021.\nThe Freedom to Vote Act is part of a larger group of bills – including the John Lewis Freedom to Vote Act, the Native American Voting Rights Act and statehood for the District of Columbia – pushed for by leading Democrats. \nSarbanes joined other voting rights activists outside the United States Capitol Tuesday for a news conference pushing for the passage of the four bills. \nSarbanes told reporters that there are two things that affect the average person’s sense of worth in a democracy: the ability to get to the ballot box and elected officials’ efforts to carry out the voters’ “hopes and dreams.” \nTo address the second part, Sarbanes’ legislation would require more disclosures of campaign fundraising, internet political ads to disclose their sponsors and further restrict candidates from associating with PACs. \n“This is where weve seen so many people frustrated and angered and plunged into deep cynicism for years now,” Sarbanes said at the news conference. “They elect lawmakers who come to Washington and other places but get influenced and captured by big money, by corporate interests, by dark, sinister voices that want to take over the democracy for themselves.”\nSarbanes called the package of four bills an “antidote for cynicism.” \nWith Republicans holding a very slim House majority, it is extremely unlikely that the four bills would come up to vote before the end of this Congress. \nIf Democrats regain control of the House and Senate after the November elections, Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minnesota, predicted that Congress would pass the four voting rights bills. \nHowever, Sarbanes is unlikely to get a chance to vote on this legislation before he leaves Congress. \nSarbanes announced in October of last year that he would not seek reelection for the House seat he has held since 2007. Instead, Sarbanes said he felt drawn back to contributing outside of his congressional duties, like working with nonprofits and volunteering. \nRep. Joe Morelle, D-New York, said Sarbanes “will be with us, both in body and spirit,” if the House is able to vote on the bills next year. \n“Representative John Sarbanes has been both one of the brilliant heads and one of the passionate hearts around ensuring that were protecting all aspects of our democracy,” Maya Wiley, the president of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, said during the press conference. \nIn the interview with CNS after the press conference, Sarbanes said there is a role for every American in the fight for voting rights. \n“Most of the people at this press conference today are not lawmakers,” Sarbanes said, referring to representatives from the ACLU and voting rights advocates from other civil rights organizations. “They represent groups that are anchored out there in the country among Americans who want their voice and vote to be respected. That broad team is a team that anyone can be on for the duration, and I intend to be part of that team.” \nAs for leaving Congress before his “democracy reform” legislation is passed, Sarbanes said there have always been new faces joining the voting rights fight, following in the tradition of the late Democratic Reps. John Lewis of Georgia and Elijah Cummings of Maryland.\n“This is a relay race, so youre constantly handing the baton to another team member or group of team members whos going to carry the effort forward,” Sarbanes said."

    "title": "Maryland’s Van Hollen and environmental groups want polluters pay for climate damage",
    "content": "WASHINGTON—Maryland Sen. Chris Van Hollen joined other lawmakers and environmental organizations on Thursday to introduce legislation that would hold the nation’s largest polluters financially responsible for the costs of the climate crisis.\n“The reason we’re all gathered here together is because we all agree on a simple but powerful principle, which is that polluters should pay to clean up the mess they have caused, and those who polluted the most should pay the most,” Van Hollen, a Democrat, said during a Capitol Hill press conference on Thursday.\nJoined by climate activists and Reps. Jerry Nadler, D-New York, and Judy Chu, D-California, Van Hollen laid out the key components of the Polluters Pay Climate Fund Act, also known as the Climate Superfund Bill. The legislation includes authorizing the Treasury Department to impose a fee on the top-polluting fossil fuel companies and oil refiners and establishing a $1 trillion Polluters Pay Climate Fund to combat the impacts of climate change.\nAmong the bill’s co-sponsors are Sens. Bernie Sanders, I-Vermont, and Elizabeth Warren, D-Massachusetts, and Reps. Jamie Raskin, D-Maryland, and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-New York.\nAccording to Van Hollen, the fund would not affect the supply or demand for gasoline, nor would it impact consumers.\n“The fee only applies to the heaviest hitters,” he said, referring to big-name energy companies like Exxon, Shell, BP and Chevron, whose emissions of carbon dioxide and methane account for at least one-twelfth of 1% of total emissions of the fossil fuel industry over the last 20 years.\nRepresentatives of the American Petroleum Institute could not be reached for comment.\nVan Hollen said that the climate fund would help address the harm and damages caused, build resilient infrastructure, provide funding for climate disaster planning and relief efforts, protect and support environmental justice for communities that have been most impacted and create millions of jobs.\nThis bill is the most recent iteration of the 2021 draft legislation by Van Hollen. Climate change bills have since been introduced in state legislatures in Maryland, Massachusetts, California and New York. In Vermont, the Climate Superfund Bill was signed into law in June.\nVan Hollen said it was important to build momentum for his bill during the election season.\n“You have to build awareness,” he said. “If the goal is to make sure that were ready to kick this off again early next year, it will require momentum so that when Congress reconvenes after the presidential election, youre ready to go.”\nAbout a dozen environmental activists and supporters attended the press conference.\nMike Tidwell, the founder and executive director of Chesapeake Climate Action Network, said the climate crisis hit home when his Takoma Park, Maryland, church and a nearby preschool flooded after an unprecedented amount of rain in 2020.\n“This is not just an Antarctica problem  this is a Takoma Park, Presbyterian preschool problem, and its unfair that churches and small towns like mine have to pay this fee when the oil companies have created the product knowingly thats triggered this problem, so this bill is long overdue,” he said.\n“People dont see the immediate connection between the climate crisis and these emergencies, but they really are fundamentally connected, and this bill would unlock a huge amount of funding to actually tackle those issues,” said Bea Portela, a representative from the Center for Biological Diversity, which is part of the coalition working on the bill.\nOther organizations backing the climate fund bill include Make Polluters Pay, the League of Conservation Voters and the Sierra Club."

Wes Moore, who used to run his own small business helping underserved students navigate college.\n“When people would tell me it’s really hard to build a business in Maryland, my response to them was always the same: I know, I had to do it myself,” Moore said in a Monday press call announcing the grant.\n“This is going to help more Marylanders turn ideas into jobs and businesses,” Moore said, “and turn individuals into job creators.”\nThe money is meant to fuel local growth and provide innovative resources to disadvantaged start up businesses in the state, according to a Treasury press release.\nThis federal funding will go to the Maryland Technology Development Corporation, an independent instrument of the state that provides funding, insight, resources and connections to early stage companies.\n“There are three ‘T’s’ that every entrepreneur faces: they face a challenge of time, a challenge of talent, and a challenge of treasure, said Troy A. LeMaile-Stovall, CEO of TEDCO.\nThe program, he said, will “give them access to talent that they need to grow and scale their enterprises.”"

    "title": "White House OKs Maryland wind energy project to be built about 10 miles off Ocean City",
    "content": "WASHINGTON – Offshore wind energy is coming to Maryland, and with it, union jobs.\nThe Biden administration on Thursday approved Baltimore-based US Wind’s project to build offshore wind turbines about 10 miles off the coast of Ocean City, Maryland.\nThe offshore wind farm could generate over two gigawatts of wind energy and power over 718,000 homes, according to the Department of the Interior.\nPresident Joe Biden said in a statement that the wind energy industry had been “struggling to gain a foothold” in the years before he came into office.\n“From manufacturing and shipbuilding to port operations and construction, this industry will support tens of thousands of good-paying and union jobs, provide reliable clean power to homes and businesses, strengthen our power grid against outages, and help reduce pollution – all while protecting biodiversity and marine ecosystems,” the president said.\nMaryland Energy Administration Director Paul Pinsky called the Biden administrations action an important step forward in the effort to bring clean, renewable energy production to Maryland’s coast.\nToday’s announcement underscores the careful, comprehensive and collaborative environmental analysis that has gone into these projects, Pinsky said in a statement.\nThe Maryland project is the tenth commercial-scale offshore wind energy project approved by the Biden administration. Combined, the projects are projected to generate 15 gigawatts of clean energy, half of Biden’s goal of 30 gigawatts of offshore wind-produced energy by 2030.\nThe Maryland project includes up to 114 wind turbines, four offshore substation platforms and a meteorological tower. There will be three phases to the US Wind project, two of which – called MarWin and Momentum Wind – have already received offshore renewable energy certificates from the state.\nEnergy is set to start flowing in December 2028 from the first phase of the project. The final project is expected to be completed in late 2027 or early 2028, according to the plan submitted by US Wind.\nThe approval is a win for Maryland environmental groups and the state government, which have been working for offshore wind power in the state for around 10 years.\nThe Maryland legislature passed a series of bills, starting in 2013, to set offshore wind energy projects in motion.\nThe state set a goal in 2023, through the Promoting Offshore Wind Energy Resources Act, to generate 8.5 gigawatts of power from offshore wind by 2031.\nThis goal has hit some road bumps along the way, including the withdrawal of Denmark-based Ørsted’s planned offshore wind projects in January.\nUS Wind won the competitive lease sale of the 46,970 acres of federal ocean waters in 2014. \n“By moving away from reliance on dirty fossil fuel energy and building renewable energy, Marylanders will be able to breathe cleaner air and benefit from new clean energy jobs,” Maryland Sierra Club Chapter Director Josh Tulkin said in a statement Thursday.\nJamie DeMarco, the federal campaigns coordinator for the Chesapeake Climate Action Network, said in an interview with Capital News Service that the Maryland wind farm is a milestone in moving offshore energy generation forward in Maryland.\n“This is a huge undertaking to build an entire machine to deploy offshore wind, but once that machine is built, itll be able to hum and crank out new domestic energy, and clean energy thats going to help us clean the air and meet our climate goals,” DeMarco said.\nOffshore wind turbines have been coming online across the East Coast, DeMarco said, but this will be the first operational offshore wind facility in Maryland.\nEnvironmental advocates aren’t the only celebrating parties. Union officials are touting the jobs set to be created by the wind farm.\nAlmost 2,680 jobs annually over seven years could be created during the development and construction phase of the wind farm, according to the Interior Department.\nUS Wind’s planned permanent offshore wind components production facility, called Sparrows Point Steel in Sparrows Point, Baltimore – the former home of Bethlehem Steel  is forecast to generate jobs for steelworkers.\nThe Baltimore Bethlehem Steel mill, which closed in 2012, was once the largest steel producer in the world. Sparrows Point Steel will bring steelworker jobs back to Maryland, DeMarco said, in a way that hasn’t been seen since the closure of Bethlehem.\nJim Strong, the offshore wind sector assistant for the United Steelworkers International Union, told CNS Thursday that the facility is expected to bring in over 500 jobs. The project will help not only steelworkers, Strong said, but other union trades as well.\n“Its about addressing our climate crisis, about creating new green energy jobs – these will be high paid union jobs,” Strong said.\nStrong has served as a liaison between the union and US Wind. He said that the Sparrows Point facility has the opportunity to become a “central hub” for monopile production on the Atlantic Ocean. Monopiles, steel cylinders, are used for wind turbines, bridges and other projects, he said.\nUS Wind is a subsidiary of Italian company Renexia SpA.\nThe project has some detractors, like Rep. Andy Harris, R-Maryland, who represents the Eastern Shore.\n“Offshore wind industrialization comes at a heavy cost to our marine life and environment, and is an incredibly expensive way to generate electricity,” Rep. Harris said on X in July. “We should never allow foreign owned companies to control our energy supply—much less harm our environment while doing it.”\nThe federal Bureau of Ocean Energy Management’s director, Elizabeth Klein, said in a statement that the Maryland project “reflects the best available science and invaluable insights from Tribes, government agencies, local communities, industry leaders, ocean users, and environmental groups gathered during our extensive environmental review process.\nAs we continue to support the undeniable momentum we see along our coasts, our focus remains on fostering responsible energy development, while protecting marine life and ecosystems,” she said.\nDemocrats in the state, including Gov. Wes Moore, have been supportive of the project. Moore signed a memorandum of understanding with the federal government in June supporting offshore wind production."

    "title": "Harris promises &#8216;new way forward&#8217; in accepting nomination for president",
    "content": "CHICAGO – Vice President Kamala Harris accepted her party’s nomination Thursday night, pledging “a new way forward” for the nation and warning that the consequences of another Donald Trump presidency would be “extremely serious.”\n“On behalf of the people, on behalf of every American, regardless of party, race, gender or the language your grandmother speaks, on behalf of my mother and everyone who has ever set out on their own unlikely journey, on behalf of Americans, like the people I grew up with, people who work hard, chase their dreams and look out for one another, on behalf of everyone whose story could only be written in the greatest nation on Earth, I accept your nomination for president of the United States of America,” Harris told the Democratic National Convention, packed to the rafters of the United Center.\nThe former prosecutor harkened to her days in the California courts to make her case against Trump, saying that while the former president was not a serious man, “the consequences of putting Donald Trump back in the White House are extremely serious.”\n“Our nation with this election has a precious, fleeting opportunity to move past the bitterness, cynicism and divisive battles of the past,” Harris said. “A chance to chart a new way forward. Not as members of any one party or faction, but as Americans.”\nMaryland delegates said Harris’ speech has fired them up for the fall campaign.\n“She said everything that we needed to hear to bring our country together, to lay out a bold vision,” said Jared Schablein, a delegate from Maryland’s Eastern Shore. “Were ready to win in November, and were ready to flip Wicomico County blue for the first time since 1964. We were 890 votes short in 2020. Were going to do it this year with the ticket of Kamala Harris and Tim Walz.”\nIf elected, Harris would be the first woman president and the first president of South Asian descent.\nThe speech began as a biographical introduction to the country, touching on Harris’ family history, childhood and key moments that propelled her into the limelight. This included a story about her high school friend Wanda, who stayed with Harris after revealing she was a victim of sexual abuse at home. Harris said she became a prosecutor to protect people like Wanda.\n“I believe everyone has a right to safety, to dignity and to justice,” Harris said. “As a prosecutor, when I had a case, I charged it not in the name of the victim, but in the name of the people…a harm against any one of us is a harm against all of us.”\nHarris, a former attorney general of California, contrasted her experience as a prosecutor against Trump’s legal woes.\n“Donald Trump tried to throw away your votes when he failed,” Harris said. “He sent an armed mob to the United States Capitol, where they assaulted law enforcement officers. When politicians in his own party begged him to call off the mob and send help, he did the opposite. He fanned the flames, and now for an entirely different set of crimes, he was found guilty of fraud by a jury of everyday Americans, and separately found liable for committing sexual abuse.”\nThe nominee then went through major policy areas that are expected to be key themes in her presidential campaign.\nNotably, Harris emphasized her unwavering support for Ukraine against Russian aggression and reminded audiences of her competitor’s tendency to side with the Russian president. On the Israel-Hamas war, she reiterated her calls for a ceasefire and release of the hostages.\nShe promised to bring back the bipartisan immigration bill Trump effectively killed earlier this year.\n“I know we can live up to our proud heritage as a nation of immigrants  and reform our broken immigration system,” Harris said.\nHarris said she intended to create an “opportunity economy” where everyone – regardless of where they grew up – has the chance to succeed. She also said she wanted to bring labor, companies and entrepreneurs together.\n“Ill tell you, this is personal for me,” she said. “The middle class is where I come from. My mother kept a strict budget. We lived within our means, yet we wanted for little, and she expected us to make the most of the opportunities that were available to us and to be grateful for them, because, as she taught us, opportunity is not available to everyone.”\nThe vice president also reiterated her determination to protect abortion rights and voting access.\nHarris said she wanted an inclusive presidency.\n“I know there are people of various political views watching tonight,” the vice president said. “And I want you to know: I promise to be a president for all Americans. You can always trust me to put country above party and self. To hold sacred America’s fundamental principles. From the rule of law. To free and fair elections. To the peaceful transfer of power.”\n“I will be a president who unites us around our highest aspirations. A president who leads, and listens, who is realistic, practical and has common sense and always fights for the American people. From the courthouse to the White House, that has been my life’s work.”\nNot far from the left side of the stage, Maryland delegates were on their feet for Harris.\n“People have more in common than they realize,” Montgomery County Executive Marc Elrich said. “We have two major parties, but on most issues at the local level, theres not a whole lot of difference between people and I wish we could bridge things the same way at a national level.”\n“She met the moment,” Johnny Olszewski, the Baltimore County Executive and a candidate for the House of Representatives said.\n“You could tell that she was just feeling and embodying the words that she was saying tonight. And the entire room, we were all standing for the length of her speech,” said Maryland state Del. Jheanelle Wilkins, also a convention delegate.\nWill Jawando, a Montgomery County Council member and a delegate, said Harris “touched on every point that this is about bringing people together, not fear and division, that this is an existential crisis to beat Donald Trump, that she has the experience, the background, the compassion, the practicality to govern for all Americans.”\n“I think she prosecuted the case,” said Maryland Senate President Bill Ferguson. “She said exactly why this is one of the most consequential elections in modern history. She is inspired about what we can be moving forward and reminded people what it would look like if we went backwards.”\nCapital News Service reporter Ava Thompson contributed to this report."

    "title": "Democrats &#8211; including Maryland&#8217;s Moore &#8211; take on GOP proposals to cut vets&#8217; programs",
    "content": "CHICAGO – Republican proposals to slash veterans programs have been drawing fire this week from Democratic veterans and delegates, including Maryland Gov. Wes Moore.\n“Im excited for the fact that we got one of our own that’s about to be the next vice president of the United States,” Moore told the Veterans and Military Families Council at the Democratic National Convention Thursday. “Its exciting to think that were going to have someone like that whos not just helping to drive our policy, but whos helping us to remind ourselves of our moral obligation.”\nAt issue are plans in Project 2025  written by the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank  to  decrease funding to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs.\nBoth parties vice presidential nominees, Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio and Gov. Tim Walz, D-Minnesota are veterans, so the repercussions of the project on veterans has been a frequent topic of conversation in Chicago.\n“Trumps Project 2025 will slash veteran benefits and force VA hospitals to close across the nation,” Rep. Ruben Gallego, D-Arizona, told the Thursday night convention crowd. “Show some respect. So, for the 18-year-old who decides to enlist, for the families like mine who prayed every night that their loved one would come home, for our troops stationed thousands of miles away, for my fellow Marines of Lima Company, lets Elect Kamala Harris and Tim Walz.”\nMeanwhile, Republicans avoided that topic last month at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee.\nProject 2025 has been under scrutiny in recent months because it was created as a blueprint for a second Trump presidency. The 900-page policy proposal calls for a reorganization of the American government that would solidify conservative rule and shrink the federal government and its functions.\nMoore, a combat Veteran who deployed to Afghanistan during his time with the Army, criticized proposed cuts to the services that help veterans like himself while lifting up the military career of his fellow governor and serviceman.\nWhile Walz was enlisted and served in the national guard for 24 years, his adversary, Vance, served a tour in Iraq as a Marine.\nDuring Moore’s Thursday speech to the dimly lit, scattered conference room full of fellow veterans and their families, he spoke of his own experiences in the military and the moments that prioritized the post-service lives not just of veterans, but their spouses and children as well.\n“We decided to go in and not just slow walk, but sprint toward solutions when I took on the role of governor,” Moore said. “We decided to introduce legislation in our first year that focused on things…that actually made the spouses of those who were serving a preferential class when it comes to hiring and retention and employment.”\nMaryland First Lady Dawn Moore testified in February before the House Economic Matters Committee in support of the Families Serve Act of 2024. She was the first first lady to testify on behalf of legislation in nearly 20 years. The bill incentivizes businesses to hire military spouses despite resumes that may show gaps due to frequent moves.\nMoore emphasized that the Vice President Kamala Harris-Walz ticket is going to remind Americans that there is a cost to freedom.\nHe concluded his speech by saying that the cost to take care of veterans and their families is a worthwhile one. He used the slogan he coined after the March collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge: “Leave No One Behind.”\n“These are people who are going to lift up those who we lost in combat and not disregard them, or somehow either confuse the Medal of Honor with the Presidents Medal of Freedom,” Moore said. “I dont know if these people are really confused, or just have no interest in actually understanding the difference. But (Harris and Walz are) people who are truly going to be our partners inside the work to create a more perfect union.”\nVeterans within the Maryland delegation at the Republican National Convention last month told CNS they trusted former president Donald Trump and Vance with veterans funding despite a history of proposed cuts by the Heritage Foundation and GOP ties to the organization.\nMoore told CNS in an interview after his Thursday meeting that the plan is harmful to veterans.\n“For any veteran who supports Project 2025, I would just ask that they look deeper into what Project 2025 is,” Moore told CNS. “What Project 2025 would do, it would do things like cut funding towards veterans. It would do things like cut support for veterans hospitals. It would do things like cutting support for our military and our personnel. Its a dangerous isolationist philosophy.”\nMILWAUKEE  Three veterans and Maryland delegates to the Republican National Convention last month said they trusted former President Donald Trump to do right by them. From left, they are Christopher Anderson, Barry Donadio and Jerry DeWolf. (James Matheson/Capital News Service)\nRepublican veterans are singing a completely different tune, though. Several Republican delegates to the RNC who served in the armed forces said they supported the project.\n“Whatever it says in the Heritage Foundation, or Project 2025, or those issues with the veterans packages, I have every confidence that President Trump will do the right thing for our military and for our veterans,” Jerry DeWolf, a delegate from Maryland’s 6th congressional district and a Navy veteran, told CNS last month in Milwaukee.\nThis support from Maryland Republican delegates for their presidential and vice presidential nominees looks beyond the pair’s ties to the Heritage Foundation and Project 2025.\nVance has embraced Project 2025 and the Heritage Foundation in recent months.\nMost Americans couldnt care less about Project 2025,” Vance said on Newsmax’s “Rob Schmitt Tonight” in July. “I’ve reviewed a lot of it, there’s some good ideas in there.\nIn the same interview, Vance said there were ideas he didn’t agree with in the policy proposals. But while Vance endorses the plan for the next administration, Trump has attempted to distance himself, saying he doesnt know who wrote the comprehensive playbook for GOP policy.\nI know nothing about Project 2025,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “I have no idea who is behind it.” The former president went on to say that some of the ideas within the document are “absolutely ridiculous and abysmal.”\nDespite the denial, at least 140 of Trump’s former ambassadors, advisers and his former chief of staff contributed or hold positions with the Heritage Foundation.\n“For veterans who are trying to understand where exactly they want to be, or what they are looking for in a candidate, I would say they should probably look for a candidate that sees them and their family,” Moore said. “They should probably look for a candidate and for a campaign that actually has policies that would benefit them and their families. I think when veterans do that, theyll see that the Harris-Walz campaign has the most comprehensive ideas as to how exactly we can support veterans and their families.”\nRepublican National Convention delegates like state Sen. Johnny Ray Salling from Maryland’s 2nd congressional district, endorsed the Heritage Foundation plan. When asked if he supports Project 2025, Salling said: “I do. And we should never try to restrict funds that would help our veterans and help their families.”\nThe 2023 annual proposed federal budget released by the Heritage Foundation recommended that lawmakers make massive cuts to veterans programs. While the recommendations are independent of Project 2025, they demonstrate a history of efforts by the Heritage Foundation to cut veterans benefits.\nThe Heritage Foundation Budget Blueprint for fiscal year 2023 consisted of over 200 policy recommendations to reduce the federal budget, two of which included capping initial applications for disability compensation at 10 years post-service and eliminating concurrent receipt of retirement pay and disability compensation. Such policy changes would require that veterans file their claims within a 10-year window after discharge.\nThe veterans in Maryland’s RNC delegation still believe a Trump-Vance ticket would protect them.\n“We understand that not everything can be done perfectly but I have full faith and confidence in President Trump, and his vice president is a Marine,” Barry Donadio, an alternate delegate for Maryland’s 1st congressional district, said. “Thats something held very, very important to the enlisted branch of all the armed services.”\nDonadio has been a part of the Secret service, Army and Air Force.\nThe Heritage Foundation’s more recent policy recommendations in Project 2025 demonstrate the foundation’s continued desire to slash benefits, cut funding to the VA, and minimize the role of the federal government. Many of these suggestions will have direct effects on the state of Maryland due to the number of federal jobs in the state between the National Institutes of Health, Fort Meade, Beltsville Agricultural Research Center or the Social Security Administration.\n“Maryland has such a close connection with the federal government that Project 2025 literally guts the federal workforce,” Ken Ulman, chairman of the Maryland Democratic Party, told CNS. “That has a disproportionate effect on the state of Maryland.”\nUnder Project 2025, some medical conditions would receive different disability ratings in the future. So veterans who filed claims down the road could qualify for fewer benefits or no benefits at all.\n“Theres this idea and this philosophy, I think that comes out of Project 2025, that individuals are and should be self-sufficient, that government does not play a role, that you know that government is not going to support you when you are sick,” Moore said."

    "title": "Democrats see abortion issue as defining &#8211; and winning &#8211; issue in fall election",
    "content": "The earlier version of this story mischaracterized former Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan’s relationship with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell’s agenda and did not fully include a Hogan campaign response to the Democrats’ criticism of his record. The story has been changed in the 18th, 19th and 23rd grafs.\nCHICAGO  Abortion has been a key talking point at the Democratic National Convention, with speeches focused on reproductive rights on every night of the convention. On Thursday night, the center was full of attendees wearing white in support of reproductive rights.\nDemocratic Party candidates and officials see reproductive rights as a defining  and winning  issue for them in the fall campaign, as it was in the 2022 midterm elections just months after the Supreme Court struck down the constitutional right to an abortion in Dobbs v. Jackson Womens Health Organization.\n“When abortion is on the ballot, we win,” Mini Timmaraju, a Maryland delegate and president of Reproductive Freedom For All, told the convention Wednesday night.\nShe noted that states including Kansas, Ohio and Kentucky  none Democratic bastions  have passed abortion protection ballot measures since Roe v. Wade was overturned.\n“And it seems like everyday another state gets added to the list,” she said, referring to Arizona and Montana as the latest states to add abortion access to their ballots in November.\nOther states that will vote on abortion rights amendments this fall are Maryland, Colorado, Florida, Missouri, Nevada, New York and South Dakota.\nA Pew Research Center survey in May found that 63% of U.S. adults believe abortion should be legal in all or most cases.\nMarylanders this fall will vote on the Maryland Right to Reproductive Freedom Amendment, also known as Question 1, which would add abortion protections to the state constitution.\nThe ballot measure “confirms an individual’s fundamental right to reproductive freedom” and provides that the state may not deny or abridge that right.\n“Question 1 is really the important insurance policy to make sure you know youre protected, no matter what,” Timmaraju, of Takoma Park, Maryland, said. “We also know the Trump administration has plans to disregard what states do and try to circumvent states through a national abortion ban. Were in very, very challenging times. We cant rely on one strategy to protect rights.”\nCHICAGO  Susan Smith, the mother of Maryland delegate Caroline Bauk, wore white for reproductive rights on the floor of the Democratic National Convention Thursday. (Caley Fox Shannon/Capital News Service)\nHealth Not Harm MD, an advocacy group opposing Question 1, believes the language in the amendment is too vague and will allow minors to access reproductive healthcare such as abortions without parental consent.\nTimmaraju said Maryland could be instrumental in helping to codify Roe nationally by electing Angela Alsobrooks to the Senate.\nAlsobrooks, the Prince George’s County executive, is running against former Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan for Sen. Ben Cardin’s seat, who is retiring this year.\nMaryland Democrats say an Alsobrooks win is critical to keep their majority in the Senate and pass pro-choice legislation. Some think it could be a close race due to Hogan’s popularity as governor.\n“I think Angela Alsobrooks is going to do fine, but we have a lot of work to make sure that Hogan doesnt have a sequel to his governorship,” Maryland Attorney General Anthony Brown told Capital News Service.\nHogan announced he is pro-choice and would sponsor legislation to codify Roe v. Wade in May, but Alsobrooks said his history as governor indicates he’s insincere.\n“Whether it be the decision to start a family with the help of IVF, or exercise her reproductive rights, Governor Hogan believes nothing and no one  especially partisan politics  should come between a woman and her doctor,” Hogan campaign spokeswoman Blake Kernen told CNS.\nGovernor Hogans position on this issue has never shifted  hes been on the record against abortion bans since 1992, Kernen said, adding that as a senator he would sponsor legislation to codify Roe v. Wade as the law of the land, and he looks forward to working across the aisle to do so.\nIf Hogan wins, he said he would caucus with Senate Republicans. Hogan does not support Donald Trump, even though the former president endorsed him.\n“As long as he doesnt commit to supporting rules reform like the filibuster, and as long as hes still committed as a Republican to supporting Mitch McConnell, it doesnt matter,” Timmaraju told CNS.\nAdvocates said Alsobrooks has a stronger record of supporting abortion access, citing Hogan’s veto of a bill that would have expanded abortion access in the state in 2022, which Democrats ultimately voted to override.\n“Angela, frankly, is a lot more tested and committed to these issues, particularly the Black womens maternal health, which is huge for Maryland,” Timmaraju said.\nKernen said Hogan did not veto legislation to restrict access to abortions, but rather he rightly vetoed legislation to allow non-licensed medical professionals to perform abortions because that would have lowered health care standards for women and has always stood up for reproductive health care that is both safe and accessible.\nVice President Kamala Harris has been a vocal advocate for reproductive choice since the repeal of Roe, and has since made the issue a key component of her bid for the White House.\nJohntel Greene, a board member for Reproductive Justice Maryland, said the focus on reproductive rights is energizing the pro-choice movement and engaging new and old advocates.\n“I’ve been so excited about the fact that everyone has just been unashamedly talking about it,” Greene said. When she attended the DNC for Hillary Clinton’s nomination in 2016, she said she didn’t remember reproductive rights being mentioned once.\n“We are a Catholic state in Maryland, and now every single speaker has given, not just an offhand mention, but a full-throated reinforcement of reproductive rights, reproductive justice and then maternal health,” Greene said."

    "title": "Democratic Convention Notebook: Raskin&#8217;s mustard, Colbert in town, Demobrats",
    "content": "CHICAGO  Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Maryland, made sure Maryland delegates could savor the flavor of the Democratic National Convention well after they leave Chicago.\n“Jamie’s Strong  Sweet Democracy Mustard” was set out on the welcome table for the state’s delegation breakfast Thursday morning and included in arrival swag bags for Maryland delegates.\nThe bottle says: Mustard that agrees with your Constitution.\nRaskin’s cousins operate the National Mustard Museum in Middleton, Wisconsin – believed by the congressman to be the world’s only museum dedicated to the condiment.\nThis isn’t the first time the family has collaborated on campaign giveaways.\n“Ever since I got into politics, theyve been making mustards for my different campaigns,” Raskin told Capital News Service Thursday.\nThe museum houses over 6,000 jars of mustard from across the world.\nRaskin v. Vance, Part Two\nRaskin told the Maryland delegation breakfast Thursday that he wanted to criticize JD Vance more during his Monday convention speech. So he took the breakfast as an opportunity to lob more shots Republican vice presidential pick.\n“JD Vance declared himself repeatedly in public as a never-Trumper … Today hes a forever-Trumper,” Raskin said. \n“Everybodys waiting for the big debate between our amazing nominee, Kamala Harris, and Donald Trump. Im waiting for the debate between JD Vance and JD Vance,” Raskin said.\nThe lawmaker also criticized Vance’s CNN interview where Vance mentioned Raskin multiple times.\n“I think I got a little bit on his nerves, a little under skin,” Raskin said. \nColbert in town\nOne of our intrepid reporters skipped the third night of the Democratic convention after winning a ticket lottery to see The Late Show with Stephen Colbert at Chicagos Auditorium Theater.\nArriving at the theater at 7:30 p.m. Wednesday, the stated time for check in, attendees were humbled by an eight-block-long line that stretched west underneath the L train from Michigan Avenue to Wells Street.\nAs guests in the theater eagerly awaited Colbert, they watched the CBS stream of the convention proceedings on several screens about the stage. Former Chicagoan Oprah Winfrey brought the house down and our reporter was the only attendee who appeared to be deeply invested in remarks from Maryland Gov. Wes Moore.\nMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz received a standing ovation inside the Auditorium, probably because the crowd was more than ready at that point for the real show to begin.\nColbert, who got his start in comedy at Chicagos Second City improv troupe, appeared thrilled to be back in the Windy City.\nFollowing his monologue, a pre-taped segment showed Colbert incognito (or not) as a hot dog vendor, hawking dawgs to Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-New York, and DNC Chairman Jaime Harrison.\nThe featured guest of the night was Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, who addressed the convention earlier in the night. And for the grand finale: a performance from Chicagos own Chance the Rapper.\nPro tip for the next show: get there early.\n(News)paper-less convention\nIts a long tradition at political conventions for newspapers  local and out-of-town  to haul in thousands of free copies of their publications to share with delegates and the press.\nNot here.\nOur reliable sources tell us that the distributors for newspapers could not work out acceptable arrangements with security officials to deliver papers every day.\nSo no Chicago Tribune, no Chicago Sun-Times, no Washington Post, no New York Times, no USA Today, no papers anywhere in the United Center complex. Plenty of their reporters are here. Just no papers.\nDemobrat summer\nCapitalizing on Kamala Harriss momentum with Gen Z online, some Democrats at the convention are wearing brat-green (sort of a neon color) demobrat pins.\nThe reference is to BRAT, the monster album from Charli xcx. And, well, if you know you know."

    "title": "Walz formally accepts vice presidential nomination, tells Democrats election is about freedom",
    "content": "CHICAGO  Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz accepted the Democratic nomination for vice president Wednesday night, telling the Democratic National Convention his party is for freedom, while Donald Trump and the Republicans are behind “an agenda that nobody asked for.”\n“Thank you, Vice President Kamala Harris,” Walz said. “Thanks for putting your trust in me and for inviting me to be part of this incredible campaign. Thank you, President Joe Biden for four years of strong, historic leadership. It is the honor of my life to accept your nomination for vice president of the United States.”\nPart of the election is about freedom, the governor said.\n“When Republicans use that word, they mean that the government should be free to invade your doctors office,” he said. “Corporations, free to pollute the air and water. And banks, free to take advantage of customers.”\n“But when we Democrats talk about freedom, we mean the freedom to make a better life for yourself and the people that you love. The freedom to make your own health care decisions. And, yeah, your kids freedom to go to school without worrying theyll be shot dead in the halls.”\nWalz offered a message of unity and echoed the campaign’s new tagline, “We are not going back.”\nFormer members of the Mankato, Minnesota, West High School football team paraded onto the stage in their old jerseys. Then Walz made his way to the podium for his most high-profile speech yet.\nThe Maryland delegation, decked out in “Maryland Tough, Baltimore Strong” t-shirts and buoyed from Gov. Wes Moore’s speech earlier, waved signs on poles that read “Coach Walz.”\nDiana Emerson, a Baltimore City delegate, said Walz was “fired up” as she walked out of the arena.\n“It truly feels like its a rally. Hes giving you all the facts. Hes not giving you filler. Hes not giving you fluff,” Emerson said. “Hes telling you what we need to do, all the things that his team will do to make sure that we cross the line and that we’re successful in 75 days.”\nKen Ulman, chairman of the Maryland Democratic Party, said Walz comes off as a “regular person.”\n“He was able to deliver that message to drive home that at the end of the day, we should elect people who are good human beings; who are in it for the right reasons,” Ulman said.\nLike he has on the campaign trail in recent weeks, Walz also told the convention about the decade he spent teaching high school social studies as well as coaching football in Mankato.\nEric Luedtke, chief legislative officer for Moore and a former middle school teacher, told CNS after Walz spoke that it was amazing to see a fellow past-teacher on the national stage.\nHis teaching background, Luedke said, sets Walz up to be a good leader.\n“I think teachers make the best leaders because they know how to serve people,” Luedke, who is also a delegate, said. “Being a good teacher is about getting to understand whats driving your students and how to support them. Being a good leader is about understanding the people you represent and how to support them.”\nLike Walz, Maryland delegate Andrew Pruski, representing Maryland’s 5th congressional district, is a former social studies teacher. Pruski, who taught at Frederick Douglass High School in Prince Georges County from 2001-2005, cited Walz’s history serving in schools and the military for why he’s so excited that Harris chose Walz to be her running mate.\nDelegate Dylan Behler, from Maryland’s 3rd congressional district, said that before Harris picked Walz, he was aware of the governor’s record of providing free lunches to students in Minnesota. Last year, Walz signed a bill to provide universal school lunch, filling gaps in the National School Lunch Program by eliminating the requirement for families to demonstrate financial need.\nBehler also sees Walz’s record as an asset to Harris: “As a school teacher from Nebraska, and representing rural Minnesota in the House  I think he can speak directly to voters across the country, but especially more independent or moderate voters.”\nWalz adds rural appeal to Harris’ bid for the White House. While Harris hails from Oakland, California, Walz was born in West Point, Nebraska, a town of 3,500 residents that voted overwhelmingly Republican in the 2024 primary election.\n“Growing up in a small town like that, you learn how to take care of each other,” Walz said.\nThose small-town origins may speak to Marylanders from the state’s more rural communities, including Garrett and Allegany Counties as well as the Eastern Shore, which tend to vote more conservatively than the state’s urban and suburban counties.\nAt the Wicomico County Fair last week, enthusiasm from residents for the Harris-Walz ticket was apparent, according to Megan Outten, a delegate from Salisbury, Maryland.\n“We were having Republicans come up to the table, life-long Republicans, who said for the first time ever, theyre going to be voting for a Democrat, and its going to be Harris,” Outten told CNS.\nOutten said that Walz gives rural Americans a chance to feel represented.\n“I think a lot of our rural communities have felt really disconnected from our past campaigns,” Outten said. “This is an opportunity to see themselves really reflected at the White House.”\nLillia Rose, 22, the president of the Mountain Maryland Young Democrats for Garrett and Allegany Counties, said Walz also connects with undecided rural voters on the panhandle of the state.\n“Being someone from rural Maryland, we face challenges that are different from the rest of the state,” said Rose, who is also a member of the Garrett County Central Democratic Committee. “So seeing someone like him really gives me hope that rural issues are being heard and advocated for.”\nBaltimore Mayor Brandon Scott said on Wednesday that Walz’s rural background does not mean he doesn’t also appeal to urban voters.\n“We know what Tim believes in,” Scott told CNS. “When people understand the amount of funding he put into education in Minnesota, when they understand how hes worked with mayors like my good friend Melvin Carter to reduce gun violence in the city of St. Paul and in Minneapolis, we will understand truly that he is someone that, while we might not be a rural place, that he has our best interests at heart.”\nWalz signed a gun safety bill earlier this year with multiple provisions, including a state ban on binary triggers, which allow firearms to discharge two bullets with one pull of the trigger, and “straw purchases,” where someone purchases a firearm on behalf of someone else who cannot legally own a gun.\nThese gun control regulations came after Walz changed his stance on guns after the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre; he previously had an “A” rating from the National Rifle Association.\n“I was a better shot than most Republicans in Congress, and I got the trophies to prove it,” Walz said. “I believe in the Second Amendment, but I also believe our first responsibility is to keep our kids safe.”\nMaryland Attorney General Anthony Brown, who served with Walz in the U.S. House for one term, praised the governor’s military background.\n“He served in the military,” Brown said. “You have fewer and fewer Americans who serve the military. We hold the military in high regard. That speaks a lot about his values: integrity, courage, dignity and commitment.”\n“Tim Walz is not only a fantastic pick but he’s the man for the moment,” state Del. Adrian Boafo of Bowie, who is also a convention delegate, said. “As a former congressman and governor, he has the experience of implementing and fighting for progressive policies. He’s an inspiring pick with a great record that will not only energize the base but will bring new voters to the Harris coalition.”\nFittingly, Walz included a football metaphor encouraging the crowd to act before the election: “Its the fourth quarter. Were down a field goal, but were on offense and weve got the ball. Were driving down the field … our job for everyone watching is to get in the trenches and do the blocking and tackling, one at a time, one yard at a time, one phone call at a time, one door knock at a time, one $5 donation at a time.”\n“We got 76 days, that’s nothing,” Walz said. “There’ll be time to sleep when youre dead.”"

    "title": "At Democratic convention, Maryland&#8217;s Moore invokes Key Bridge recovery as &#8216;story of America&#8217;",
    "content": "CHICAGO  Maryland Gov. Wes Moore used the speedy recovery from the Francis Scott Key Bridge collapse in March as an example of the American spirit in an impassioned speech to the Democratic National Convention Wednesday night.\n“While many said it could take 11 months to reopen the Port of Baltimore, we got it done in 11 weeks. Because that is the story of America,” Moore told delegates and the nation. “We are a nation of patriots who serve when the mission is hard and who serve when the destination is uncertain.”\nIn 2022, Moore was the first Black governor elected in Maryland and the third in United States history. A rising star in the Democratic party, Moore’s handling of the bridge collapse and the aftermath brought him national attention.\nMoore was cheered by Maryland delegates wearing shirts with the slogan “Maryland Tough, Baltimore Strong,” which the governor coined after the bridge collapse, and signs reading “Leave No One Behind,” his gubernatorial campaign slogan.\nFrom the section of seating left of the convention stage, the Maryland delegation shouted a chorus of “Wes, Wes, Wes” during key moments of his speech. One delegate, eyes locked on Moore, neck craned towards the stage, was Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott.\n“The governor did a phenomenal job as he always does, reminding people what true leadership is, what true service to your country is,” Scott told CNS after the speech. “You see what someone is made of when you have tragedy. As the person who knows that story very well myself, being the person that called the governor about the bridge and received those calls from the president and vice president and (Transportation) Secretary (Pete) Buttigieg, it shows that when you’re in a tragedy, in a situation that no one knows or has never been there before, that’s where true leadership shows.”\nThe Key Bridge was struck on March 26 by a cargo ship, sending it plunging into the Patapsco River and obstructing the Port of Baltimore, the ninth largest port in the United States for foreign cargo tonnage. The global shipping businesses, cruises and 15,300 Marylanders directly employed by the port were affected by the disaster.\nIn 78 days, Unified Command removed more than 50,000 tons of debris from the river, fully restoring the channel and opening the port.\n“Making America great means saying the ambitions of this country would be incomplete without your help,” the governor said. “Its the legacy of those six workers who fixed potholes on a bridge while we slept, who were born in a different country, but who knew that America was big enough for them too.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHICAGO  Maryland Gov. Wes Moore spoke to the Democratic National Convention Wednesday night, urging the nation to vote for Kamala Harris for president. (Josh Davidsburg/Capital News Service)\nMoore was a fervent supporter of former President Joe Biden until he ended his reelection campaign. Since then, the 45-year-old governor has transferred his attention to electing the first Black, female president, Kamala Harris.\nDuring the speech, Moore touched on his shared background with Harris, both the children of immigrant parents.\n“Its the journey of a man raised by a remarkable immigrant single mom, a man who felt handcuffs on his wrist at 11 years old, who now stands before you as the 63rd governor of Maryland and the first Black governor in the history of our state,” Moore said. “Its the story of a prosecutor who defended our freedoms and had Marylands back when we needed it most, and now MVP, weve got your back as well, right?\nMarylands delegates chanted MVP, referring to Madame Vice President.\nMaryland delegates and political figures are basking in the spotlight Moore has drawn. Everywhere they go, they said, when people find out they’re from Maryland, the first thing they want to talk about is Moore, a possible future presidential candidate.\n“The man is just full of exuberance. When he comes into the room, theres a light. Hes got the it factor,” said Leathia West, Maryland state director for Biden and a delegate from the 4th congressional district. “I havent seen this kind of enthusiasm generally since Barack Obama.”\nNo doubt that figured in his pre-taped appearance on “The Daily Show,” which ran on Comedy Central shortly after his speech.\n“I dont even have to say who he is. They just already know, Baltimore City delegate Tia Hopkins said. “Its like he already has that national profile, and people are already seeing this greatness in him.”\nMoore has been making the rounds at the DNC, speaking at the Georgia and Wisconsin delegation breakfasts, announcing the Maryland delegation vote tally during the roll call of the states Tuesday night and getting a scheduled spot at the veterans caucus Thursday.\nI think Wes Moore, hes representative of this country, right?” said Maryland delegate Tiffany Carlock, from the 5th congressional district. “He is the person who is the first Black governor of the state of Maryland…so he knows about making history.”"

    "title": "Democratic Convention Notebook: Earl the Muskrat, river cruise, walk up songs",
    "content": "CHICAGO  Delegates from Marylands Eastern Shore to the Democratic National Convention are being joined by a mascot this week: Earl the Muskrat.\nEarl may have had one of the best seats in the house for former President Barack Obamas speech from the perch of a 3-foot-high VOTE sign that a Maryland delegate proudly held in the air.\nCHICAGO  Earl the Muskrat appeared to enjoy Wednesdays Maryland delegation breakfast at the Democratic National Convention. We say appeared because he did not have any comment. (Katharine Wilson/Capital News Service)\nI cant be sure, but I feel like Barack Obama saw it on top of the stick and looked at it for at least a minute, and was like, what is that?' Connor Romblad, the delegate holding the sign, told Capital News Service at the Wednesday morning delegation breakfast.\nEach year, the Chesapeake Bay regions hosts the Eastern Shore’s Crawfish Boil  Muskrat Eating Championship, and residents enjoy skinning and eating the semiaquatic rodent native to North America.\nEarls Chicago journey can be followed on Instagram @earlthemuskrat. \nSurprise visitor\nFormer House Speaker Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-California, made a surprise stop at the Maryland delegation breakfast Wednesday morning to emphasize the states importance in getting Democrats control of the House and keeping control of the Senate. \n“We must make a decision to win the election and make every decision in favor of it,” Pelosi said. \nThe speaker emerita was born and raised in Baltimore, but her Maryland connections run deeper: her late father, Thomas DAlesandro Jr., and her late brother,  Thomas DAlesandro, both served as mayors of Baltimore.  \nPelosi, who was running later than expected, missed remarks from Senate candidate and Prince George’s County Executive Angela Alsobrooks, who gave a keynote address to the DNC Tuesday night.\nAs the sleep-deprived crowd of delegates awaited their surprise guest, Maryland Democratic Party Chairman Ken Ulman and Sen. Chris Van Hollen “filibustered” remarks to keep the excitement up. \nChicago River cruise\nThe Maryland delegation spent part of the third day of the Democratic National Convention on the water, as the delegates enjoyed a boat cruise along the Chicago River. \nThe vibes were high aboard the Odyssey Chicago River. As the Doobie Brothers “What a Fool Believes” played throughout the vessel, the delegates schmoozed about, glasses of wine in hand, hors doeuvres aplenty. The host, equipped with a microphone, smoothly reviewed the historic skyscrapers as the boat passed by. \nThe excursion served as an opportunity for Maryland Democrats to connect with one another, but also to decompress after a busy first two days. \nDelegation walk-up songs\nWhile on said river cruise and at the delegation breakfast, CNS reporters asked Maryland delegates what their walk-up songs would be.\nA walk-up song is the music that plays while a baseball player prepares for an at-bat. For the non-sporty, political crowd, a walk-up song is one that plays as speakers come to the podium at the DNC.\nWe received a mix of answers, mostly upbeat, enthusiastic songs.\nThe exception to this rule being one guest of the delegation who answered “Tennessee Whiskey,” a soul-filled country ballad from Chris Stapleton.\nTwo hip-hop classics tied for the most popular answer to our question: two delegates, including Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott, voted for the scathing diss track from Kendrick Lamar, “Not Like Us,” while another two preferred DJ Khaled’s classic “All I Do Is Win.”\nOut-of-town police help\nLast months Republican National Convention in Milwaukee drew a ton of assistance not only from myriad federal agencies but also from out-of-town police departments from Maryland to California and a lot of places in between.\nThe Chicago Police Department hasnt asked for as much assistance, but we have randomly spotted officers from other Illinois cities, including Springfield, Pontiac (yes, theres a Pontiac, Illinois) and Joliet."

    "title": "Maryland lawmakers say Biden legacy secured by decision to step aside",
    "content": "CHICAGO – As the Democratic Party switches leaders from Joe Biden to Kamala Harris, Maryland lawmakers say the president’s political legacy was secured by his decision to end his reelection bid.\n“Hes the savior, and history will look back on him – the way we look back on Jimmy Carter –  as having been a great president who was not always appreciated in his time,” Rep. Kweisi Mfume, D-Maryland, told Capital News Service on the floor of the Democratic National Convention.\nThe first night of the convention marked the changing of the guard from Biden to Harris as the president gave a teary-eyed speech to cheering and affectionate delegates and Democratic party leaders in the packed United Center.\nBiden, who was in his 20s when his national political career began, is five months away from saying goodbye to over 50 years in the national spotlight.\n“I can honestly say, and I mean this from the bottom of my heart, giving my word as a Biden: I can honestly say Im more optimistic about the future than I was when I was elected as a 29-year-old United States senator. I mean it,” Biden said.\nSen. Ben Cardin, D-Maryland, told CNS Tuesday on the convention floor that Bidens presidency was the most productive administration since the New Deal. The senator, who said he had a chance to visit with Biden on Thursday, said it felt both nostalgic and emotional to watch the recording of Bidens DNC speech.\nHe has really seen throughout his career so much changes and hes been responsible for so many good things, Cardin said.\nRep. Jamie Raskin, D-Maryland, said Biden will be remembered for his “extraordinary public commitment” and his history as part of multiple progressive reforms, including the civil rights, LGBTQ+, women’s rights and environmental movements.\nRaskin wrote a letter to the president in July suggesting that he end his political campaign, calling Biden’s presidency “one of the finest in American history,” but adding: “Democracy is the system where we take turns.”\nRaskin told CNS Tuesday that Biden “has taught us that an essential component of real leadership is to make room and make space for new leadership.”\n“We got these great new generations of young people coming along, and weve got to make space for them to contribute their ideas and their perspectives,” Raskin said.\nOn Biden’s presidential inauguration day, the country was still under COVID-19 restrictions and was reeling from the Jan. 6 attempted insurrection.\nSen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Maryland, said Biden succeeded in his goal of restoring the soul of America and helping change peoples lives for the better.\n“Joe Biden saved this country,” Mfume said. “Hope was lost, divisions were increasing and Joe Biden came in with a sort of senior, grandfatherly calm.”\nMfume said Biden’s actions to control the COVID pandemic and send out stimulus money were crucial to getting the country out of its fragile state.\nIn Maryland, Rep. Glenn Ivey said, Biden’s infrastructure legislation – which is funding bridges, road repair and a Baltimore rail tunnel – will bring benefits for years to come. Other Biden administration highlights Ivey listed include expanding high speed internet access and bringing down prescription drug costs.\nHowever, what cemented Biden’s legacy for Mfume was the decision to step aside, what he called “the ultimate commitment.”\nRep. Steny Hoyer, who has been friends with the president for over 50 years, said he was watching the president’s address from the stage. The congressman said he felt pride watching Biden address the convention and said the decision for Biden to step aside was more than a personal sacrifice.\n“I think he looks at it as an extension of his desire to make sure America does well, lives out its values and takes care of its people,” Hoyer said.\nThe 85 year-old lawmaker made a decision similar to Biden’s, “passing the torch” to the next generation. Hoyer decided to step away from House leadership – where he served as majority leader until 2023 – at the same time as House Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi, D-California, and Rep. Jim Clyburn, D-South Carolina.\n“The three of us thought it was time for us to step down, not out,” Hoyer told CNS. “And thats what we did. It was the right thing to do.”\nAfter a disappointing debate performance and multiple members of his own party privately and publicly calling on him to step aside, Biden ended his candidacy and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris for president on July 21.\n“It was a tremendously unselfish act,” Ivey said.\nBiden’s decision to step down, Ivey believes, was rooted in the president’s desire to help the party and block “damaging proposals” in Project 2025 and the Trump agenda.\nWhile Ivey said Biden’s  realization that he had to step down was likely a “hard pill to swallow,” it has set the party on a trajectory to push policies in the right direction and expand the party base."

    "title": "At the convention, Maryland&#8217;s Alsobrooks offers tribute to Harris as friend, mentor, role model",
    "content": "CHICAGO – Maryland Senate candidate and Prince George’s County Executive Angela Alsobrooks made her debut on the national stage Tuesday, giving a keynote address to the Democratic National Convention about her mentor Vice President Kamala Harris.\n“Ever since Donald Trump rode down that ridiculous elevator, we as a nation have felt trapped,” Alsobrooks said. “Every national decision has been made in reaction to this one man and his extremist MAGA movement. We are still frozen by the fear that Donald Trump might once again come to power.”\n“And it’s not just our politics that have been trapped. It’s our imagination. And then, Kamala came along,” Alsobrooks told the roaring crowd in the United Center. “Kamala has reminded us that we don’t need to fear anything. Not the future and certainly not that man.”\nAlsobrooks, first elected county executive in 2018, is running in a high-profile Senate race against former Republican Gov. Larry Hogan for the seat of retiring Sen. Ben Cardin, D-Maryland. She did not mention Hogan in her address.\nThe race could help decide the party balance in the Senate, where Democrats currently have a razor-thin majority.\nThe Senate candidate said she first heard of Harris through a 2009 Essence magazine article profiling the then-San Francisco district attorney.\nAlsobrooks, who was running for Prince George’s County state’s attorney at the time, said she was inspired by Harris’ “Back on Track” program for rehabilitating some non-violent offenders through job training, GEDs and apprenticeships.\nDays after Alsobrooks won her election in 2010 – after a campaign in which she talked about Harris “non-stop” – she received a call from Harris congratulating Alsobrooks and asking to help. A mentorship and a friendship was born.\nThe now-Democratic presidential nominee, Alsobrooks said, helped bring “Back on Track” to Maryland, where crime decreased and the economy improved.\n“Getting justice for others isn’t a power trip for her – it’s a sacred calling,” Alsobrooks said. “And hear me  Kamala Harris knows how to keep criminals off the streets. And come November, with your help, she’ll keep one out of the Oval Office.”\nCHICAGO  Maryland Senate candidate and Prince Georges County Executive Angela Alsobrooks addressed the Democratic National Convention Tuesday night. (Caley Fox Shannon/Capital News Service)\nAlsobrooks recalled her grandmother’s determination to get a job in the government, which required a typing test. Without money for a typewriter, her grandmother drew a keyboard on a piece of paper and practiced typing with it taped on her refrigerator door.\n“I’ve always been inspired by women like my grandmother – women who imagine a better future and then have the grit to make it a reality,” Alsobrooks said, adding that Harris is one such woman.\nAlsobrooks also repeated the now-popular Democratic chant “we’re not going back,” which the packed crowd echoed multiple times.\nCheering on from the Maryland section were both Maryland senators, Cardin and Chris Van Hollen, along with four of the House members from the state – Glenn Ivey, John Sarbanes, Jamie Raskin and Kweisi Mfume.\nVan Hollen told Capital News Service afterward that Alsobrooks “had a grand slam, knocked it out of the park.”\n“People were really paying attention,” Van Hollen said.\nCardin called Alsobrooks “one of the rising stars of the Democratic Party.”\nIn the Democratic primary, Alsobrooks beat current Rep. David Trone, D-Maryland, by over 10 percentage points despite being outspent by over $50 million.\nAlsobrooks became the second Maryland politician to address the 2024 convention, following Rep. Jamie Raskin’s Monday remarks. Gov. Wes Moore, D-Maryland, is expected to speak later this week."

    "title": "Hoyer doesn’t let a stroke keep him from joining his fellow Maryland Democrats in Chicago",
    "content": "CHICAGO – Just nine days after suffering a minor stroke, Rep. Steny Hoyer, D-Maryland, addressed the Maryland delegation’s breakfast at the Democratic National Convention on Tuesday.\nThe longtime Maryland politician and former House majority leader approached the stage in the Sheraton Grand Chicago Riverwalk Hotel in front of an already warmed-up delegation. Hoyer, 85, had his longtime friend, Rep. Kweisi Mfume, D-Maryland, to thank for that.\n“(Hoyer) was the first person that I met when I got elected to Congress,” Mfume told Capital News Service. “(House Speaker Emerita) Nancy Pelosi, (the late Georgia Rep.) John Lewis, (Maryland Sen.) Ben Cardin, myself and (former Maryland Rep.) Tom McMillen from the University of Maryland all got elected in ‘86, we got sworn in in ‘87. Steny, from that day forward, has taken the time to make sure not just me, but any member coming into Congress has the benefit of his experiences and his wisdom.”\nMfume, throughout his 15-minute speech to the delegates, caused some to forget the scrambled eggs, sausage links and various quadrilaterally-shaped melons on which they were dining. He reminded delegates that there is a basic five point democratic reaffirmation to use to wake up each morning.\n“Hello neighbor, hello friend, the father has brought us, through thick and thin,” Mfume said as he urged those in attendance to grab their neighbors’ hands and repeat after him. “And to our cause, he must be true, but I can’t help it, that I look better than you.”\nThe crowd laughed, reminisced and thanked Hoyer for his service to the party as well as the 14 consecutive conventions he’s attended.\n“Ive had immense, immense respect for him for all these many years,” Mfume said in his remarks. “Im the only one that says, ‘Steny Hamilton Hoyer.’ Nobody else can. Steny, were just glad you’re here, you had a little scare. We all prayed for you, God has delivered you and you are here today.”\nHoyer’s scare came on Aug. 11, when he experienced a mild ischemic stroke, according to his deputy chief of staff and spokesperson, Margaret Mulkerrin.\nHoyer said he experienced the stroke in Cape Cod before being transported to a local hospital. He was later transported to Boston Medical Center.\nWhen Hoyer took the podium in front of the Maryland blue crab backdrop and an audience that had risen to its feet, the veteran lawmaker used his health as a benchmark for the work and successes of Democrats in health care.\n“Im glad I can be here with all of you today,” Hoyer said. “As you can see, Im the beneficiary of wonderful, wonderful health care. We Democrats have ensured that that health care system is available to almost every American, and we need to make sure it is available to every American.”\nHoyer thanked health care workers across the country as well as those who make health care accessible.\nHe transitioned to discussing Democratic success in education. Hoyer’s late wife, Judith P. Hoyer, was involved in education during her career. Hoyer has assisted in opening 86 early childhood learning centers throughout Maryland in her honor.\nJudith P. Hoyer Center Early Learning Hubs, otherwise known as “Judy Centers,” benefit children and families throughout every county in Maryland by improving the quality of life for families, according to the organization’s website.\nHoyer has huge fans in the Maryland delegation.\n“Just the belief that he has in the Democratic Party and the values that the Democrats still show forth to everyone, hes the epitome of that,” Del. Sheree Sample-Hughes said of Hoyer. “Knowing that education, healthcare – those pillars – are important to communities across the entire state, not just in one specific region, he understands that.”\nSample-Hughes worked directly with Judy Centers when she served on the Tri-County Council for the Lower Eastern Shore of Maryland. She said her collaboration while working as the director of the Family Support Center in Salisbury, Maryland, alongside Judy Centers helped cater to not just children in Title I schools but their parents as well.\n“The Judy Center, as well as the Family Support Center  we collaborated and put our resources together…We made sure we partnered together to make sure we were meeting the needs of both populations,” Sample-Hughes said. “We work with the same type of communities, persons that are in need of that extra level of support.”\nDuring his speech, Hoyer acknowledged his second wife, Elaine Kamarck, for her support in and around the days of his stroke. Kamarck told CNS she advised her husband to skip the convention. He had other plans.\n“He was still in the hospital, and he was saying, ‘Yeah, were going to Chicago,’” Kamarck said. “I voted against it, but the doctors actually sided with him and said, ‘Youre okay, just take it easy.’\nHoyer’s speech came the morning after President Joe Biden delivered the keynote address to the convention. The speech served as a farewell of sorts.\n“All I was thinking is that its nine days after a stroke, and the guy is speaking more forcefully and clearly than half the people we heard last night,” Kamarck said, comparing the two 80-plus-year-old politicians. “I was really pleased.”\nBiden was pressured to withdraw from the 2024 presidential election by 38 members of Congress due to his shaky debate performance in late June. On July 21, the president announced his withdrawal from the race and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris as his replacement.\nHoyer told CNS that Biden’s decision to step out of the race had no bearing on his own future in politics.\n“As you know, I stepped down as majority leader after being the number two leader for 20 years in the House,” Hoyer said. “I did so because I think we had some extraordinary young people.”\nOne such young Democratic figure in attendance Tuesday morning was Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott.\nScott said both Mfume and Hoyer have been influential in his political success and continue to serve as mentors in his career.\n“I’ve known Steny since I was in college. He was on the Board of Trustees at (St Marys College of Baltimore) when I was a student leader,” Scott said. “Weve had some good conversations over the years as well. Im very appreciative. I always say that I have the best congressional delegation of any mayor in the country.”"

    "title": "At Democratic convention, Raskin recalls Jan. 6 and warns of Trump&#8217;s threat to democracy",
    "content": "CHICAGO  Maryland Rep. Jamie Raskin warned the nation Monday in an address to the Democratic National Convention that former President Donald Trump remains a danger to democracy and is being abetted by “Banana Republicans.”\n“Make no mistake, a man who uses fraud, theft and violence to take power will commit any crime to keep it,” Raskin told cheering delegates.\nWere going to defeat Donald Trump, the career criminal and incorrigible recidivist con man and his pet chameleon. JD Vance, the congressman said.\nA constitutional lawyer, Raskin recalled the harrowing moments of the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the United States and said it was the “worst high crime and misdemeanor ever committed by a president, inciting insurrection against our own Constitution.”\nRaskin gained national prominence as the lead manager in Trump’s second impeachment trial and as a member of the House’s Jan. 6th select committee. The four-term lawmaker is also the ranking member on the House Oversight and Accountability Committee.\nRaskin reminded the convention crowd about the near-tragic fate of former Vice President Mike Pence, who was the subject of death threats from the rioters. Pence has said he will not endorse Trump or Vice President Kamala Harris.\n“Someone should have told Donald Trump that the presidents job under Article Two of the Constitution is to take care that the laws are faithfully executed, not that the vice president is executed,” Raskin said.\nHe added: JD Vance, do you understand why there was a sudden job opening for running mate on the GOP ticket? They tried to kill your predecessor.”\nIn contrast to Trump’s legal woes, Raskin emphasized Harris’s history as a prosecutor and called her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, an “inspiring public servant.”\nRaskin said Democrats need to defend democracy against “Banana Republicans who have converted Lincolns party into a dangerous cult of personality.”\n“Its been a little rough on Capitol Hill, where its not just the heat, its the stupidity,” the Marylander quipped.\nRaskin wrote a letter to President Joe Biden in July suggesting that the president should end his candidacy. Biden gave his convention speech less than two hours after Raskin spoke.\nRaskin isn’t the only high-profile Maryland politician expected to hit the main stage this week.\nMaryland Gov. Wes Moore teased his speech themes during a virtual Sunday press call, saying he would mention the importance of service and reclaiming patriotism from the Republican Party. He said he was unsure about where he will be on the convention schedule."

    "title": "Democratic Convention Notebook: Crab mallets, snowplows, and union scabs",
    "content": "CHICAGO  The first Maryland delegation breakfast at the Democratic National Convention kicked off Monday morning with some gifts for the delegation: Fisher’s popcorn, Guinness coffee mugs and crab mallets.\r\nMaryland Democratic Party Chairman Ken Ulman used an under-sized mallet in lieu of a gavel, officially calling the state delegation to order in blue crab style.\r\nDonald Trump is a Scab\r\nUnited Automobile Workers were spotted in t-shirts reading Trump is a Scab.\r\nOne convention attendee tucked the bright red shirt below his Ford fleece zip-up jacket. The Detroit automaker, along with General Motors and Stellantis, last year faced the first strike in history targeting all three automakers. In more recent news, the UAW last week filed federal labor charges against Donald Trump and Elon Musk after threatening workers in an X interview.\r\nOn Monday, 75 miles northwest of downtown Chicago, the UAW threatened a national strike after Stellantis pushed back its timeline on the reopening of the Belvidere Assembly Plant.\r\n“This company made a commitment to autoworkers at Stellantis in our union contract, and we intend to enforce that contract to the full extent,” UAW President Shawn Fain said in a press release. “On behalf of autoworkers everywhere, we’re standing up against a company that wants to go back on its commitments and drive a race to the bottom at the expense of the American worker.”\r\nFain, along with six other union leaders, spoke on the first night of the convention. Fain also wore the Trump is a Scab shirt.\r\nWalz making his rounds\r\nCNS staff were in attendance at both the Black and LGBTQ+ Caucus meetings at the McCormick Place Convention Center, where Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Walz, the governor of Minnesota, made surprise appearances in rapid succession. Both crowds welcomed the former teacher with spirited responses. \r\nWeve got 78 days to make a generational difference, not in just this country, but in the world, Walz said to the Black Caucus. We understand something that we grew up hearing about: towards a more perfect union. Strong and decent nations acknowledge their past, the good, the bad, the ugly that goes with it. We acknowledge it because it lets us chart the course for the future.\r\nWalzs remarks to the LGBTQ+ Caucus were similar. He told attendees that human rights were not to be likened to piece of pie: Theres enough for everybody.\r\nSnowplows are out!\r\nIt is pretty much standard procedure these days for cities to use large refuse trucks and similar bulky, heavy vehicles to block streets as part of security measures.\r\nWell, Chicago is deploying its (kinda rusty) snowplow fleet to help block off some streets for the Democratic National Convention.\r\nYes, the trucks are out there with their plows attached  just a bit early for the city’s famous monster snowstorms.\r\nPuttin some mustard on the message\r\nAn iconic Chicago hot dog establishment called The Wieners Circle has a special deal running this week: 3-inch hotdogs. \r\nNow serving Trump footlongs, the establishment posted on the sign out front. Its 3 inches. \r\nThe perfectly-sized hotdog is being sold for $3.50 at the Lincoln Park restaurant. \r\nIts the best freakin hotdog you ever had, all 3 inches, one employee said in a promotional video on Instagram."

    "title": "Schumer crashes Maryland delegation breakfast, touts Alsobrooks candidacy",
    "content": "CHICAGO  Maryland Democratic Party Chairman Ken Ulman called the delegation to order in lieu of a gavel, instead hammering a crab mallet on Monday morning. Before that, Ulman introduced a surprise special guest to the stage.\n“Wait a minute,” Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-New York, said. “Can I crash this party?”\nThe Maryland delegation is in Chicago this week for the Democratic National Convention. Each morning, the party hosts a breakfast at its convention hotel for Maryland delegates to meet and hear from various speakers.\nThe New York delegation breakfast was located just steps from where the Maryland delegation enjoyed a full buffet along with a coffee and juice bar. When Schumer passed the hall on his way over, he said he had to stop in.\n“We are honored to have Senator Schumer here as well,” Ulman said.\nSchumer thanked Gov. Wes Moore and quickly moved raised the candidacy of Angela Alsobrooks, the Prince George’s County executive who is running for the U.S. Senate against former Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan.\n“I want to make sure that we elect Angela Alsobrooks,” Schumer said.\nSchumer said that while many Marylanders remember Hogan during his term as governor, voters should understand that in the Senate he would hurt democracy, the right for women to make decisions regarding their own reproductive health and working families.\nSchumer stressed that Alsobrooks’ victory also would be important for Baltimore.\n“The damn Republicans are holding up money for that damn bridge,” Schumer said, referring to the Baltimore’s Francis Scott Key Bridge, which collapsed on March 26 after a ship struck a supporting pier.\nRep. Andy Harris, the sole Republican member of Maryland’s congressional delegation, has said he supports federal spending for the Key Bridge reconstruction.\nHe disagreed with Schumer’s assertion that this is a partisan issue.\nChuck Schumer is the Majority Leader in the Senate. If he thought funding the Key Bridge right now is important, he could have put that bill on the Senate floor months ago,” Harris said in a statement to Capital News Service. “But he thinks its easier to play partisan political games with the Key Bridge, and blame Republicans for his failure to get things done in the Senate. But he cant fool the American people any longer.\nAlsobrooks was not in attendance at the breakfast, according to the deputy director of the Maryland party, Joe Francaviglia, but he said that she is expected later this week.\nIn other news from the breakfast, Moore commented on the diversity of the delegation.\n“This is a delegation that looks like America,” Moore said before he headed over to the Wisconsin delegation breakfast, also down the hall, according to a post on his X account.\nHe noted that the delegation’s seats are close to the stage in the convention arena at the United Center.\n“Right now, Marylands on the move, and people are paying attention,” Moore said.\nMoore boasted that the state had among the lowest unemployment rates in the United States thanks to his administration’s job-creating efforts, a drop in violent crime and homicide rates and a program for high school graduates to take a service year option.\n“People are talking about the fact that Marylands doing something really unique and different right now: were actually working together,” the governor said.\nThe breakfast honored Lt. Gov. Aruna Miller, who addressed the delegation. Her speech generally focused on how Maryland would contribute to Democratic wins in November.\n“Lets show the nation what Maryland does best: serving blue crabs and blue victories,” Miller said. “Stay strong. Stay blue.”\nMiller invited Secretary of the Interior Deb Haaland to the breakfast. Haaland told the Marylanders why representation matters, as she bears the title of the first Native American party leader.\n“At a time when women are losing rights by the minute, the climate crisis is hurting communities, and the Republican agenda threatens to make life harder for everyone, it matters more than ever,” Haaland said."

    "title": "Maryland organizer joined pro-Palestine march at Democratic convention",
    "content": "CHICAGO  Among thousands of protesters at the March on the Democratic National Convention Monday was 23-year-old Ahlam Dahood of Frederick, Maryland, who traveled solo to call for Vice President Kamala Harris to end the U.S. supply of weapons to Israel.\nDahood, a Palestinian American, is a founding organizer of MD2Palestine, an advocacy group that raises awareness and funds for Palestinian causes and endorsed the March on the DNC alongside more than 220 groups from across the country.\n“Harris is second in command in the Biden administration, and people seem to be forgetting that very conveniently,” Dahood told Capital News Service.\nWhile Harris renewed her call for a ceasefire in Gaza at an Aug. 9 campaign rally in Glendale, Arizona, Dahood isn’t satisfied with the current administration or the Democrats’ presidential hopeful. Dahood told CNS that voting for President Joe Biden in 2020 was “the worst mistake of my life” and plans to vote for third-party candidate Jill Stein.\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken said Monday that Israel had agreed to the details in a new ceasefire proposal. Hamas has not yet responded to the proposal, the product of intense negotiations in recent days.\nDahood said Biden and Harris are “refusing to go to the next step, which is an arms embargo and ending military aid and weapons to Israel. The ceasefire demands from them are empty words, because you have the power to implement the ceasefire by not sending the weapons that are being fired on the Palestinians.”\nSpeakers and signage at the March on the DNC Monday reflected the shift from protesters calling for a ceasefire to now demanding an outright ban on weapon sales to Israel.\nHarris’ national security adviser, Phil Gordon, tweeted Aug. 8 that Harris “does not support an arms embargo on Israel.”\nThe State Department announced Aug. 9 that it would release $3.5B as part of an aid package passed in April to supply Israel with U.S.-made weapons and military equipment for its offensive in Gaza.\nDahood was born and raised in Frederick by a Palestinian father and an American mother.\n“Growing up there, there were not a lot of Palestinians. I wasnt very much in touch with that identity, despite having traveled to Palestine,” she told CNS.\nAs a student at the University of Maryland, Dahood participated in Students for Justice in Palestine for five years, including three years in leadership. The group, which Dahood says became her “political home,” organizes educational and cultural events on campus.\nShe visited her family abroad last during the summer of 2022, taking trips to the beach and spending quality time with extended family and friends. Now she says she worries for their safety.\nCHICAGO  Ahlam Dahood, of Frederick, Maryland, attends a pro-Palestinie rally near the Democratic National Convention on Monday. (Caley Fox Shannon/Capital News Service)\nFollowing Hamas’ attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, leaders from Biden to UMD President Darryll Pines expressed support and condolences for Israel.\nBut as the Palestinian death toll has mounted to at least 40,000, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, Dahood said those same American officials have been less vocal about the grief of Palestinians in recent months.\n“It just makes you feel like your community, your people, your family, your loved ones dont matter as much,” she said.\nDahood, who has a bachelor’s and master’s degree in public health from the University of Maryland, said she feels angry when the U.S. government allocates billions of dollars in military aid to Israel instead of investing in American communities.\n“Its just such a slap in the face every single time,” Dahood said, “when you know what that money could mean for our communities that are struggling, and for our communities that dont have health care, and for people who cant put food on the table.”\nAhead of the March on the DNC, Dahood told CNS: “A lot of people are very angry at the Democratic Party, rightfully so, and people will definitely make sure that the Democratic Party hears their frustrations.”\nAt the rally Monday, Dahood wore a brown keffiyeh scarf that a friend brought her from the West Bank, along with a baseball cap with “Palestine” stitched in Arabic letters and two pendants dangling from her neck in the shape of her father’s home country.\nWhen asked if she had a message for Maryland delegates to the DNC, Dahood said, “I would say, take a long, hard look at whats happening in Gaza and think about if you want to have that on your conscience that you supported that.\nState Del. Adrian Boafo, from Bowie, Maryland, and a convention delegate representing the 5th congressional district, told CNS ahead of the convention: “I assume therell be a lot of protests on a ton of different issues. And look, thats how democracies work. People agree and disagree, and everyone has the right to have their voice heard.”"

    "title": "Mix of Maryland political superstars, newcomers at the Democratic convention",
    "content": "CHICAGO  One-hundred thirty-eight Maryland delegates and political officials have come to Chicago for the Democratic National Convention this week, looking to build on the surging energy in the party generated by the candidacies of Vice President Kamala Harris and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz.\nGov. Wes Moore, Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott, U.S. Senate candidate Angela Alsobrooks and U.S. Sens. Ben Cardin and Chris Van Hollen are among the group’s most prominent political figures. Other Marylanders are making their debuts as delegates to the DNC.\n\nMoore, who is expected to address the full convention this week, told reporters on a virtual press call Sunday that he’s going to be busy this week talking to veterans, young voters and other groups.\n“I think the thing that I want people to know is that this is the campaign thats actually bringing joy into this race,” Moore said. “This is the campaign thats bringing unity into this race, and this is the campaign that actually believes in partnership to be able to produce the kind of results that people are hoping for.” \nAll Maryland delegates are pledged to Harris, the Democrats’ nominee who will be ceremonially nominated this week at the convention and whose campaign has galvanized the party since President Joe Biden withdrew on July 21.\n“Were going to be energized, excited,” Maryland Democratic Party Chairman Ken Ulman told Capital News Service. “Were going to come out of Chicago. Its going to be Labor Day, and boom  we’ve got a two month sprint. So I think its easier now to keep the momentum than in most campaigns.”\nThe Maryland contingent at the convention is expected to include the following people:\n\n63 pledged district-level delegates\n8 alternate delegates\n21 at-large delegates\n7 members of the Maryland congressional delegation\n12 Democratic National Committee members\n11 other party leaders and elected officials\n\nThe group originally expected all seven Democratic U.S. House members, but Rep. David Trone is traveling overseas and Rep. Dutch Ruppersberger will also not be in attendance, according to their offices.\nRep. Steny Hoyer, who sustained a mild stroke on Aug. 11, still will be in attendance, according to his deputy chief of staff, Margaret Mulkerrin.\n!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r=0;r\nUlman said he was looking forward to the convention, which convenes Monday and will culminate Thursday with Harris’ acceptance speech.\n“Excited, motivated, uplifted,” Ulman said when asked what he hopes that Maryland voters get from the convention. “It's going to be refreshing after seeing a party that just tears people down,” he continued, referring to the Republican Party.\nUlman, 50, will be serving as chair for the Maryland Democrats for the first time. Ulman is the former Howard County executive and worked for former Gov. Parris N. Glendening. When Moore came into office in 2023, he asked Ulman to serve as chair of the party.\n“For me, this is actually a full-circle moment, going to Chicago for the convention,” Ulman said.\nTwo years into his political career, at 22, Ulman worked the 1996 Democratic National Convention, also held in Chicago.\nHeading into the week, Ulman said he is not worried about the campaign peaking early.\n“I’m focused on making sure we sustain the momentum,” he said. “It's actually a wonderful thing that this came together when it did, because, as Walz said, ‘you can do anything for 90 days.’”\nThe chairman said that the Maryland party has a ground game that has already been “unleashed” and will continue after the convention to keep the momentum in the state. The party is opening field offices across the state and organizers are knocking on doors, including in the Eastern Shore and Western Maryland, where Ulman said Democrats typically don’t canvas.\nAccording to Ulman, Marylanders will turn out to the polls in November not just for the presidential ticket, but also for congressional races and a ballot measure to amend the Maryland Constitution to protect abortion.\nAn additional issue on the minds of Maryland’s delegates to the DNC is the economy.\n“Maryland isn't the only state that's dealing with this issue of housing,” said Adrian Boafo, who was elected to the Maryland House of Delegates in 2023. “Folks who want more wages, folks who want better health care. A lot of the things I just mentioned are all federal policy. It's why you see people excited about mobilizing around the vice president and Governor Walz in this moment. But I think the economy is on top, the top of mind for everybody right now.”\nBoafo, elected as a delegate from Maryland’s 5th congressional district, is attending his first convention. He intended to go to the 2020 convention with Hoyer, who he worked for as campaign manager at the time, but the gathering was mostly virtual due to the COVID pandemic.\nAnother newcomer to the convention is Sheree Sample-Hughes. After serving as a member of the Electoral College last election cycle, Sample-Hughes is representing Maryland’s 1st congressional district.\nSample-Hughes said that the Harris-Walz campaign must prioritize solutions to problems. She said she expects Democrats to demonstrate a “unified front” at this year's convention.\n“(Voters) want health care addressed at a national level and state level and local level,” Sample-Hughes said. “They want economic stability, those types of things…My point is that a unified front is necessary as we move through this election and re-energize the base, but at the same time, let people see that the United States is one that we should, and continue to be proud of.”"

    "title": "Walz, Harris&#8217;s VP pick, draws plaudits from Maryland Democrats, scorn from most Republicans",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  Vice President Kamala Harris’ choice of Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate Tuesday won praise from Maryland Democrats, who pointed to the governor’s experience and approach to politics as key assets in the fall campaign.\nMaryland Republicans, with one notable exception, saw little to like in the final piece of the Democratic ticket that will face off against former President Donald Trump and his vice presidential choice, Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance.\nRep. Steny Hoyer, D-Maryland, said in a statement that Democrats and other voters should be excited for his friend Walz, whom he called an invaluable member of the House Democratic Caucus during his time in Congress.\n“His plainspoken, common-sense approach to governing allowed him to deliver for veterans and Minnesotans,” Hoyer said. “I know he will bring that same dedication and empathy to the vice presidency.”\nWalz served in the House from 2007 until January 2019, when he became Minnesota’s governor. He was reelected in 2022.\nHarris’ decision on her running mate came hours after she officially became the Democratic Party’s nominee for the presidency, clinching the vote of 99% of delegates in a virtual roll call. Walz and Harris are set to start a battleground state tour together this week, debuting Tuesday evening in Philadelphia.\nBefore his political career, Walz was a high school teacher, football coach and command sergeant major in the Army National Guard.\nMaryland Gov. Wes Moore, highlighted fellow Democrat and veteran Walz’s experience in the Army and his “proven track record of progress” in a Tuesday post on X, formerly Twitter.\n“His incredible journey of service…isn’t just a source of inspiration for future generations and evidence of his deep commitment to this country; it’s also proof of his effectiveness as a leader who is going to generate wins not just for the Democratic Party in November, but for the entire country,” Moore said.\n“To the window..to the Walz!!!” the Maryland Democratic Party tweeted, inviting Maryland residents to sign a card welcoming the governor to the campaign.\nRep. Jamie Raskin, D–Maryland, called Walz “a rock star to veterans, teachers, football players and common-sense Americans.”\nPrince George’s County Executive Angela Alsobrooks, who is the Democratic candidate for the Senate, said in a statement that the Harris-Walz ticket presents a vision that stands “in diametric opposition” to the Trump-Vance ticket and is instead focused on protecting freedoms.\n“I couldn’t be more excited for Vice President Harris, for Maryland, and for our country in her decision of Governor Tim Walz to be her running mate,” Alsobrooks said.\nWalz signed numerous pieces of LGBTQ+ protection legislation throughout his governorship including bills that protected gender-affirming care, banned book bans due to LGBTQ+ content and banned conversion therapy. The governor also signed bills protecting abortion in Minnesota and people who travel to Minnesota for the procedure.\nSen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Maryland, who also served with the governor in Congress, said there was no better person to serve alongside Harris.\n“Tim has always put our country first,” Van Hollen said in a statement. “Im excited and ready to do everything I can to turn out the vote and elect President Harris and Vice President Walz – a brighter future for all Americans and our democracy depends on it.”\nSen. Ben Cardin, D-Maryland, kept his endorsement succinct, posting on X: “Harris-Walz. Strong. Experienced. Authentic. Unifying. Exciting! Can’t wait to cast my ballot.”\nRep. Andy Harris, the sole Republican in the Maryland congressional delegation, joined other party members in accusing Walz on X of being “pro-open border and repeating the false claim that Harris is the “border czar.”\n“It is no surprise failed Border Czar Kamala Harris picked a running mate who is more pro-open border than she is,” Andy Harris tweeted. “The same person who said he would invest in a ladder factory to defeat Trump’s border wall is now vying to be VP.”\nWalz was critical of Trump’s border wall proposal, supported a pathway to citizenship for DREAMers and signed a law that allows undocumented immigrants to get drivers licenses.\n“The selection of Tim Walz as the Democrat candidate for vice president just confirms what we already knew: this is the most extreme, far-left ticket in modern American history,” the Maryland Republican Party said in a statement.\nHowever, Republican Senate candidate and former Maryand Gov. Larry Hogan struck a different tone than his GOP counterparts. Hogan congratulated Walz on X and said the country needs more governors on the national level because “governors have to actually get stuff done.”\n“While we come from different parties, I have always appreciated his dedication to public service,” Hogan said, acknowledging their past working together as governors.\nHogan is in an awkward place in his own party, whose national convention in Milwaukee he skipped last month. He has said he will not support Trump, even though the former president has endorsed him."

    "title": "Maryland Democrats praise Biden&#8217;s withdrawal, Republicans blast Harris over border",
    "content": "WASHINGTON, D.C.  Maryland Democrats on Sunday quickly praised President Joe Biden’s sudden decision to withdraw from the presidential race just weeks before the Democratic National Convention and some immediately backed Vice President Kamala Harris as the party’s new standard-bearer. \n“Maryland has had a stalwart ally and tireless friend in President Biden,” Maryland Gov. Wes Moore, a potential 2028 presidential candidate, said in a statement. He cited Biden’s aid after the March collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore.\n“Our state and country are back on track with the help of this administration, and we know that President Biden will continue to have Maryland’s back as he focuses solely on fulfilling his duties as president for the rest of his term,” Moore said.\nAxios reported, citing sources, that Moore will endorse Harris on Monday.\nMaryland Rep. Steny Hoyer called Biden’s move “one of the greatest acts of patriotism in American history.”\nJoe Biden, my friend of nearly 55 years, has already proven himself among the pantheon of our best Presidents, and this selfless decision further reaffirms his position as a great American leader, willing to put the needs of our nation above his own,” Hoyer said in a statement. “His service in the United States Senate, as Vice President of the United States, and impressive legislative victories as our President will impact generations of Americans and people around the world.”\nHoyer later released a statement through his congressional campaign endorsing Harris.\n“Now, it is imperative that we come together and defeat Donald Trump at the ballot box this November, Hoyer said. I am proud to offer my full support to my friend Kamala Harris. Vice President Harris has shown herself to be a strong, experienced, and effective leader. Her service at the local, state, and federal level makes her uniquely qualified to be President of the United States. The very soul of our nation remains on the line, and I am confident that Vice President Harris will lead our party successfully and protect the values American and Maryland families hold dear.”\n“Joe Biden has earned the right to determine his own future and I respect his decision,” retiring Sen. Ben Cardin, D-Maryland, said in a statement. “I thank him for his incredible service with all my heart.” \n“Donald Trump is unfit to hold elected office,” the senator said. “Democrats, along with Independents and Republicans, now must be united and focus our attention on preserving our nation, our Constitution and our way of life under the rule of law.”\nBiden announced his withdrawal early Sunday afternoon and endorsed his vice president for the top of the Democratic ticket. \nSen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Maryland, said in a statement: “President Biden has always put our country first, and in making this decision, he has once again done what he thinks is best for the future of our democracy.”\nPrince George’s County Executive Angela Alsobrooks, who is running for Cardin’s seat against former Maryland Republican Gov. Larry Hogan, said “President Biden knows more than anyone the profound stakes of this election.”\n“He knows the grave threat to our freedoms and to the future of our country that Donald Trump and a Republican Senate majority pose,” she said in a statement. “That’s why it is paramount that Democrats come together quickly and unite behind a qualified leader.”\n“Kamala Harris is that leader,” Alsobrooks said. “She will provide a clear and stark contrast to the regressive vision Donald Trump has for this country. She will make this race about the future and the kind of country our children deserve to inherit. Each and every one of us deserves that kind of leader.”\nTop Maryland GOP officials, not surprisingly, had a different take.\n“President Biden’s withdrawal from the 2024 race saves the American people, and Marylanders, from the possibility of suffering under another four years of his failed ‘leadership,’” Maryland Republican Party Chairwoman Nicole Beus Harris said in a statement.\n“In their coverup of Joe Biden’s incompetence, the Democrat Party has failed America, and they need to be held accountable,” she said. “Amid Democrat division and weakness, the Republican Party remains united behind returning President Trump to the White House and Making America Great Again!”\nHer husband, Rep. Andy Harris, the only Republican in the Maryland congressional delegation, tweeted: “Reminder: Kamala Harris is the failed ‘Border Czar’ of this administration. We are witnessing an invasion at the Southern Border because of her failed leadership.”  \nThe Democratic Party has been scrambling to respond to public concerns over the president’s fitness since a poor debate performance on CNN June 27. While Democratic leaders stood by the president in the immediate aftermath of the debate, prominent progressives more recently urged Biden to reconsider his chances. \nThe Associated Press reported last week that former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-California, met with Biden to speak frankly about his poor polling numbers. Former President Barack Obama expressed worries about the fall campaign to his political allies, the AP also reported.\nMeanwhile, a chorus of Democrats called for Biden to pull out, including Maryland Rep. Jamie Raskin, California Rep. Adam Schiff and Vermont Sen. Peter Welch, as well as high-profile donors like actor George Clooney. \n“Joe Biden is one of the handful of truly great presidents in American history and a patriot beyond measure,” Raskin wrote on X Sunday. “We Democrats will be unified and focused behind our next President, Kamala Harris, to keep their great success going and to defeat the autocrats, theocrats and plutocrats.”\nMaryland Rep. Kweisi Mfume tweeted that Biden’s tenure “will be revered forever.”\n“At this moment, we all would be better off if we allow him to have the dignity that he deserves and has earned in this moment,” the congressman said. “He has been and remains a great President who through the simple eloquence of his example has led our nation and the world through tough and difficult times.”\nMaryland Rep. David Trone wrote on X Sunday: “I commend President Biden’s decision to allow a new generation of leaders to take this country to new heights  leaders who will continue his legacy of unity and strength, of focusing on what brings us together, not what tears us apart.”\nDemocratic delegates will need to formally pick the new nominee at their party convention August 19-22 in Chicago.\nHarris must select a running mate in short order, as state-specific deadlines loom in the coming weeks to be added to the November ballot. \nNew data shows that Harris is popular with the liberal base. In a poll out this week from The Economist and YouGov, 79% of Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters indicated that they would vote for Harris if she were on the ballot. \nYet that same poll shows Trump with a strong lead over Harris, with support from 44% of those surveyed compared to Harris’ 39% in a contest where Biden is not on the ticket. \nTrump accepted his nomination at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee Thursday. At a rally in Michigan Saturday  before Biden’s announcement, Trump said he calls the vice president “laughing Kamala.”\n“You ever watch her laugh? She’s crazy,” Trump said.\nWhile Biden was an obvious target for conservative ire at the convention, Harris did not escape the proceedings unscathed. Tuesday’s theme was “Make America Safe Once Again” and a litany of speakers lambasted Harris’ performance as “border czar” for the Biden White House. \nAnne Fundner, whom the GOP featured as an “everyday American,” addressed the convention Tuesday night and blamed the Biden-Harris border policy for her teenage son’s accidental and fatal fentanyl overdose in California in 2022. \n“I hold Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, the border czar — what a joke — and Gavin Newsom and every Democrat who supports open borders responsible for the death of my son,” Fundner said. \nThe Biden-Harris campaign suspended campaign activities last week following a failed assassination attempt on Trump at a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. Biden subsequently tested positive for COVID-19 on Wednesday and traveled to his Rehoboth, Delaware, home to isolate. \nThe president is expected to address the nation later this week. \nCapital News Service reporters Joey Barke, Emily R.

    "title": "Accepting nomination in third bid for the White House, Trump reprises familiar themes",
    "content": "MILWAUKEE  Accepting his party’s third consecutive nomination for the presidency at the Republican National Convention Thursday night, former President Donald Trump reprised his campaign themes by denouncing President Joe Biden and Democrats and claiming his myriad legal challenges were their work.\nTrump’s speech was touted in advance by GOP officials as a message of unity. \nIndeed, Trump said in the opening minutes of his speech, “We rise together, or we fall apart. I am running to be president for all of America, not half of America.” \nMILWAUKEE  On the final night of the Republican National Convention, Donald Trump accepts his nomination to run as the GOP presidential candidate. (Imani Agbionu/Capital News Service)\nBut the sometimes rambling address Trump delivered was peppered with off-script complaints about how he’s been treated by the press, the 2020 election and attacks by opponents like “Crazy Nancy Pelosi,” the former speaker of the House. \n“Under the current administration, we are indeed a nation in decline,” Trump said. Referring to Biden, he said “the damage that he has done to this country is unthinkable.”\nTrump is the only candidate with felony convictions and a sexual abuse verdict and defamation damages to be nominated by a major political party. He is appealing those verdicts but also faces other federal and state trials.\nTrump promised to reduce crime, reverse Biden’s environmental initiatives, combat inflation, block the exportation of U.S. jobs overseas, provide “massive tax cuts for workers,” and protect Social Security and Medicare. \nIn pledging to end illegal immigration, Trump mentioned the case of Rachel Morin, the Bel Air, Maryland, mother who was murdered last year, allegedly by an undocumented man from El Salvador. \nMILWAUKEE  Maryland Republican National Convention delegates Christopher Anderson (in the red cap) and Jerry DeWolf wear ear coverings in solidarity with former President Donald Trumps bandaged ear that was wounded in assassination attempt. (Imani Agbionu/Capital News Service)\n“I’m feeling energized. That was the most unifying speech I think I’ve ever heard Trump give,” Ben Marchi, an at-large delegate from Easton, Maryland, said. “It’s a level of focus that contrasts with Joe Biden and this administration. So much that I think it’s convincing for most voters out there.”\nTrump began his one-and-a-half-hour address in a positive tone.\n“Friends, delegates, fellow citizens, I stand before you this evening with a message of confidence, strength and hope,” he said. “Four months from now, we will have an incredible victory and we will begin the four greatest years in the history of our country.”\n“Together we will launch a new era of safety, prosperity and freedom for citizens of every race, religion, color and creed,” he said. “The discord and division in our society must be healed. We must heal it quickly.” \nThe somber 45th president recounted in vivid detail Saturday’s assassination attempt in Butler, Pennsylvania. He appeared healthy except for a white bandage over his right ear where he was wounded. \n“I’ll tell you what happened,” said Trump, “and you’ll never hear it from me a second time because it’s actually too painful to tell.”\nThe nominee recounted in detail how he was shot, rally goers remained calm, and Secret Service agents did their duty in neutralizing the gunman Thomas Matthew Crooks. \n“I’m not supposed to be here tonight. I’m not supposed to be here,” Trump said.\n“Yes you are!” the packed convention chanted back to him.\nTrump paid tribute to Corey Comperatore, the Pennsylvania firefighter who was killed Saturday, as well as the two men critically injured at the rally, David Dutch and James Copenhaver.\nMany convention-goers sported makeshift ear bandages of their own in a show of solidarity with Trump. \nTwo Maryland delegates, Christopher Anderson and Jerry DeWolf, decided to join in the trend. Anderson said: “If he can stand up, I can stand up too.” \n“Part of the thing that just touched every heart was hearing about his feelings about what happened with his almost being assassinated,” former U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Ellen Sauerbrey, a Maryland at-large delegate, said after the speech. “He has such a positive, upbeat, hard-charging attitude about the future of this country.”\nFormer First Lady Melania Trump made her first public appearance of the campaign, silently greeting the convention earlier in the evening before sitting next to Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance, the vice presidential nominee, and Vance’s wife, Usha Chilukuri Vance, during Trump’s address. \nWhile Trump espoused political cohesion, several prominent members of the GOP were conspicuously absent  most notably his former vice president, Mike Pence. \nTrump took no responsibility for his many legal troubles. \n“The Democrat Party should immediately stop weaponizing the justice system and labeling their opponent as an enemy of democracy,” Trump said.\nHe called the Justice Department’s case against him for taking classified documents “fake,” adding he had endured “witch hunts” for eight years.\nTrump’s lawyer-turned-campaign-adviser Alina Habba told the convention Thursday night “the only crime President Trump has committed is loving America.”\nIn May, the 45th president was found by a jury to be guilty on 34 counts of falsifying business records in connection with a hush money payment to adult film actress Stormy Daniels. A judge has delayed his sentencing until at least September. \nDespite his legal woes, new data shows that Trump continues to lead Biden in the presidential race. In a poll out this week from The Economist and YouGov, Trump leads Biden 43 to 41 percent. \nIn response to Trump’s address, the Biden-Harris campaign wrote on X: “Tonight, Donald Trump rambled on for well over an hour and failed to mention Project 2025 even once.” Project 2025 is the Heritage Foundation’s conservative blueprint for a second Trump presidency. \n“He failed to mention how he had inflicted pain and cruelty on the women of America by overturning Roe v Wade,” the statement continues. “He failed to mention his plan to take over the civil service and to pardon the January 6th insurrectionists. He sought to find problems with America, not to provide solutions.”\n“President Biden is more determined than ever to defeat Donald Trump and his Project 2025 agenda in November,” the Biden-Harris statement concluded. \nBiden’s candidacy has been a topic of fierce debate since a weak performance in the first 2024 debate against Trump on CNN June 27. The president looked and sounded his 81 years, rambling incoherently at times and speaking in a hoarse whisper at others. \nThe Biden campaign is again on pause after the president tested positive for COVID-19 Wednesday. Biden has assured the public he feels well and is isolating at his vacation home in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware."

    "title": "Many Maryland delegates back Hogan’s decision to skip convention amid split with Trump",
    "content": "MILWAUKEE  Former Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, who is running for the Senate, was not here this week as fellow Republicans from his state cheered Donald Trump’s third nomination as the GOP presidential standard-bearer.\nMany Maryland delegates appeared comfortable with Hogan’s decision.\n“His tickets are at home. His votes are at home. He needs to be there cause hes doing exactly what he needs to do to win in November,” Nicole Beus Harris, Maryland Republican Party chairwoman, told Capital News Service on the convention floor Wednesday night.\nHogan is in an awkward political spot. He is not supporting Trump this year and he did not back the former president in 2020 or 2016, either. But Trump in June said he would support Hogan, saying to Fox News “I’m about the party and I’m about the country.”\n “Honestly, I think the fact that Trump endorsed him is more harmful than the fact that Hogan does not like or support Trump,” Todd Eberly, associate professor of political science at St. Mary’s College of Maryland, said in a statement to CNS.\n“In order to win, Hogan needs to win about 1 in 4 Democratic voters,” he said. “Being endorsed by Trump doesn’t help with that.” \nThe convention that concluded Thursday night with Trump’s acceptance speech was entirely the former president’s operation. \nTrump’s GOP critics, like Hogan, Utah Sen. Mitt Romney, former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski were not welcome. Even former presidential candidate Nikki Haley, who earlier this year said she would not back Trump, received a mixed reception when she endorsed him in a convention speech earlier this week.\nOhio Gov. Mike DeWine, whose tenure began while Hogan was still governor of Maryland, had no criticism of his fellow Republican. \n“And the thing about the governor…is, you know, he’s going to do what he thinks is right, and I think that’s what people in Maryland would want,” DeWine said in an interview. “He’s consistently done that throughout the time he was governor. He’ll do that as a United States senator.” \nOn May 30, tensions between Hogan and the Trump camp flared when Hogan tweeted that Americans should “respect” whatever the verdict would be before Trump was convicted on 34 felony counts in the New York hush money case.\n“Regardless of the result, I urge all Americans to respect the verdict and the legal process,” Hogan’s X post read. “At this dangerously divided moment in our history, all leaders  regardless of party  must not pour fuel on the fire with more toxic partisanship. We must reaffirm what has made this nation great: the rule of law.”\nA senior Trump advisor, Chris LaCivita, tweeted back at Hogan: “You just ended your campaign.” \nLara Trump, co-chair of the Republican National Committee and Trump’s daughter-in-law, said on CNN the next day that Hogan doesn’t “deserve the respect of anyone in the Republican Party” or anyone in America.\nNevertheless, Trump subsequently said he supported Hogan’s Senate bid against Democrat and Prince George’s County Executive Angela Alsobrooks.\n“I can say that at least he (Trump) extended his grace to him (Hogan),” Maryland State Sen. Johnny Ray Salling, R-Baltimore County, said in a phone interview Thursday. “So it will be good if it can go both ways.”\nSalling said that he wishes Hogan would have attended the convention. He believes Hogan’s absence doesn’t benefit the Republicans’ efforts to capture the Maryland Senate seat.\n“(Attending) shows strength; it shows unity. I think more than ever now, we are unified, ever since the attempted assassination,” said Salling, who attended the first two days of the convention.\nBut other Maryland GOP delegates and officials in Milwaukee didn’t share Salling’s view.\n“The party is united. We are enthusiastic. We are ready for November,” Beus Harris said.\nChristopher Anderson, a Baltimore City Republican Central Committee member and a convention delegate, is currently campaigning for Baltimore City Council. He said he does not see a divide in the GOP.\n“No, its not a rift in the party,” Anderson said. “Hogan’s busy doing his campaign in Maryland.” \n“I mean, Hogan has an uphill climb for the Senate,” he added. “I mean, this is a very major race. I dont think he shouldnt be here. I think he should be in Maryland getting votes.”\nAnd contrary to LaCivita’s post, Hogan’s campaign is quite lively. Back in Maryland this week, the former governor spent the week on campaign-related events.\nHogan met with local law enforcement officials, advocated for veterans services and benefits, picked up the endorsement of the Maryland Forward Party and called for unity in politics, according to Blake Kernen, the former governor’s campaign spokesman.\n“Governor Hogan is focused on reaching voters in Maryland  not Milwaukee,” Kernen said in a Thursday statement to CNS.\nThe Forward Party, formed by 2020 Democratic candidate Andrew Yang and former New Jersey Gov. Christine Todd Whitman, a Republican, was formed less than two years ago as a centrist alternative to the Republicans and Democrats.\nThe Maryland Forward Party’s website features a statement titled: “Voting Against Trump: Our Rationale.”\nChristina Trotta, secretary for the Republican Central Committee of Harford County and a delegate, said she understands Hogan is very “busy” back home. \nSteve Schuh, an Anne Arundel County delegate at the convention, said that he’s not the person doing Hogan’s schedule but that the former governor should be spending “every minute” in the state.\n“I think Republicans in Maryland know that its an important race for Larry Hogan to win for all of Marylanders and for the Republican Party. It’s our best chance,” Schuh said.\nAnderson called the absence a campaign move.\n“I think what youre seeing with Hogan is strategy,” he said.\nThe Democrats are defending 23 Senate seats this election cycle. Every race is critical because Senate control is at stake. The Democrats currently hold a narrow 51-49 seat majority with the aid of three independent senators who caucus with them.\nThe nonpartisan Cook Political Report currently rates the Maryland Senate race as “likely D.”\nCapital News Service Reporters James Matheson and Daniel Stein contributed to this story."

    "content": "MILWAUKEE  A star-studded lineup has graced the shores of Lake Michigan here at the Republican National Convention this week.\nOn a number of our convoluted routes required to decipher the blockaded streets around the convention, CNS staff has run into a slew of celebrities.\nFormer British Prime Minister Boris Johnson climbed into his limousine as the CNS staff explored the Brewhouse Inn  Suites of Milwaukees Brewery District.\nWe dont know which was cooler, examining the original brewing kettle copper domes used by the old Pabst Brewery or getting a glimpse of Johnsons quintessential blond, bed-head hair.\nProfessional basketball player and human rights activist Enes Kanter Freedom visited the convention.\nThe 6-foot-10-incher, who last played for the Boston Celtics in 2021, towered above his fellow Trump supporters.\nThe president of the UFC, Dana White, and professional wrestler Hulk Hogan both were on the bill to deliver speeches on the final evening of the convention.\nLast and certainly not least, pro-Trump rapper Forgiato Blows new song Trump Trump Baby, featuring fellow rapper and model Amber Rose, was blasted from the big screen inside the Fiserv Forum on Tuesday night. The GOP audience received the effort in silence.\nMother Marjorie \nTrump faithful are wringing every drop of political fervor out of their nominees close-call last week with an assassination attempt in Butler, Pennsylvania.\nRNC attendees and delegates have been seen donning bulky bandages on their right ears, an homage to former President Donald Trump and protest against political violence.\nBut one speaker at the convention trumps them all.\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, of Georgia, credited divine intervention for saving Trump.\nShe said in an interview with the Breitbart News Network that before the attempted assassination, the American flag behind Trump was tangled by the wind into a shape of an angel.\nIt was like an angel coming down and it was the American flag tied, she said.\nWe found the Prince Georges County Police\nCNS staff finally located the members of the Prince Georges County Police Department recruited as part of beefed-up security for the convention.\nEarly Thursday morning, we ran into three officers inside the Milwaukee Skywalk System.\nThe officers were finishing the night shift, part of a force of about 4,000 out-of-town police working around Milwaukee.\nThe countys police department sent 20 officers to assist the City of Milwaukee Police Department, a spokesperson told CNS.\nThe officers were tasked with staffing security checkpoints, traffic control and maintaining a security presence within hotels, among other duties.\nPolitics for sale\nIt doesnt appear that politically-themed tomes are in high demand at the Milwaukee Public Library.\nWe found a double-shelved cart packed with political books that have been removed from library circulation and put on sale in the Bookseller, a book shop operated by the Friends of the Milwaukee Public Library.\nThe books cover the gamut, from Let Trump Be Trump, by former Trump 2016 campaign manager Corey Lewandowski and Maryland Republican National Committeeman David Bossie, to Conservatives Without Conscience by John Dean, former White House counsel in the Nixon administration who helped blow the lid off the Watergate scandal.\nGood night, or good morning, whatever\nWisconsin really thought of everything before the GOP convention came to town.\nWay back in December, Wisconsin Gov.

    "title": "J.D. Vance introduces himself to American voters at GOP convention",
    "content": "MILWAUKEE  Delivering the most important speech of his short political career, Donald Trump’s running mate Sen. J.D. Vance drew on his humble Ohio origins Wednesday night to introduce himself to the American people during the penultimate session of the Republican National Convention.\n“To Middletown, Ohio, and all the forgotten communities in Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Ohio, and every corner of our nation, I promise you this,” Vance said, “I will be a vice president who never forgets where he came from.”\nWith the exception of Ohio, the other three states he mentioned happen to be swing states in the upcoming election. \nVance drew heavily on his Appalachian upbringing, which he described in his best-selling 2016 memoir, “Hillbilly Elegy.” \nVance was officially certified as Trump’s vice presidential nominee in the convention’s first session Monday afternoon. \nAs Maryland convention delegates waited for Vance’s remarks on the floor Wednesday night, they expressed optimism about the Trump-Vance ticket’s ability to tackle issues that matter to Marylanders. \nChristopher Anderson, a Baltimore County delegate, described Vance to Capital News Service as “very articulate, very intelligent, and I think he can handle the vice presidency just fine.”\nAnderson said he wanted to hear Vance make an appeal to Black and brown voters that he described as being “left behind.” \n“You gotta have familiarity with the situation in urban communities to do something about it,” Anderson said. \nWhile Vance’s speech omitted mention of Black communities, the junior senator acknowledged that his wife Usha, who preceded him on the convention stage, is the daughter of South Asian immigrants. \n“Together we will put the citizens of America first, no matter the color of their skin,” Vance said, indicating a willingness to open the MAGA circle to a more diverse base.\nThat message ran counter to official convention signs waved by delegates that said “MASS DEPORTATION NOW!” \nVance also refuted the notion that his family in a low-income area of rural Appalachia would experience advantages in society over people of color. Yet, Vance said, “our media calls them privileged and looks down on them.” \nVance spoke at length of how the opioid epidemic affected his community, and in particular his mother. Vance’s mother Beverly waved from the crowd, standing next to House Speaker Mike Johnson. According to Vance, she is nearly 10 years sober from opiates. \nSteve Schuh, an Anne Arundel County delegate, said: “I think that J.D. Vance is going to bring a unique focus on the opioid crisis that is affecting our country.” It’s a perspective that, according to Schuh, is urgently needed as “Maryland has been devastated by opioids.” \nOutside of Milwaukee, Maryland Democrats have been quick to denounce Vance’s record. \nLuca Amayo, a spokesperson for the Maryland Democratic Party, told CNS: By nominating J.D. Vance as the Republican choice for vice president, the GOP has elevated an avowed MAGA Republican dedicated to passing a national abortion ban without exceptions for rape and incest, gutting Social Security and Medicare, and realizing the extremist aspirations of Project 2025.”\nBut Vance hasn’t always been a MAGA Republican. Vance told PBS’s Charlie Rose in an October 2016 interview: “I’m a Never Trump guy. I never liked him.” \nVance also told Rose that Trump supporters are cynical about America’s future and dissatisfied with themselves. \n“You think about the slogan ‘Make America Great Again.’ The implication is that America isn’t great right now,” Vance said. “And if you’re very unhappy about your life, that’s going to resonate.” \nThe vice presidential nominee is now courting those same MAGA voters to turn out to the polls, having flipped his position on the 45th president. Trump’s 2022 endorsement of Vance in a crowded Senate race propelled the “Hillbilly Elegy” author to elected office. \nThe abortion issue was conspicuously absent from Vance’s speech, although the senator has been vocal in the past about restricting abortion access. And beyond abortion, Vance has sought to inhibit reproductive freedom in other ways.\nEarlier this summer, Vance voted against the Right to IVF Act, a bill introduced by Sen. Tammy Duckworth, D-Illinois, to protect and expand nationwide access to fertility treatment, including in vitro fertilization. \n“Donald Trump, J.D. Vance, and the Republican party have all made it clear that our freedoms are disposable,” Angela Alsobrooks, Prince George’s county executive, told CNS. “Abortion rights. Contraception. IVF. These are the freedoms Republicans are trying to rip away,” \nAlsobrooks is running a hotly contested senate race against former Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan as Democrats and Republicans vie for a crucial majority in the upper chamber. \nIf the Trump-Vance ticket wins in November, Vance would wield a critical tie-breaking vote as president of the Senate. \nIn such an outcome, Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine, a Republican, would appoint Vance’s replacement to the Senate. That appointee would hold office until at least December 2026. \n“That’s why we must defeat the extreme Trump-Vance ticket and hold onto our Democratic Senate Majority,” said Alsobrooks. “This election, and the 51st seat, will determine whether or not our freedoms will be protected.”\nWhile the upshot of Maryland’s Senate race may tip the scales in one party’s favor, the Free State is expected to once again vote Democratic for President Joe Biden, who won the state by 33 points over Trump in 2020. \n“The Maryland Republican Party and their candidates keep doubling down on their extreme far-right agenda, which Maryland voters have repeatedly rejected at the ballot box, Amayo said. \nMaryland GOP leaders did not respond to CNS’ request for comment. \nTrump will speak Thursday evening to conclude his party’s convention. It will be the first time the former president speaks publicly since a failed assassination attempt at a Pennsylvania campaign rally Saturday. \nCapital News Service Reporter Emily R.

    "title": "Brother of Bel Air murder victim speaks at the Republican convention",
    "content": "MILWAUKEE  The brother of a Maryland woman whose 2023 murder has fanned the flames of immigration policy debate addressed a packed stadium of delegates Tuesday night at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee. \n“Open borders are often portrayed as compassionate and virtuous,” said Michael Morin, 40, of Churchville, Maryland. “But there is nothing compassionate about allowing violent criminals into our country and robbing children of their mother. My sister’s death was preventable.” \nRachel Morin, a 37-year-old mother of five, was reported missing August 5, 2023, after going for a jog on the Ma  Pa Trail in Bel Air. Her body was found nearby the following day.\nAfter 10 months of investigation, Harford County Sheriff Jeff Gahler announced in a June 15 press conference the arrest of Victor Antonio Martinez-Hernandez, a 23-year-old citizen of El Salvador, for Rachel’s murder. \nAccording to Gahler, the suspect illegally entered the country in February 2023 after allegedly murdering a woman in his home country. Martinez-Hernandez is also accused of a home invasion and assault in Los Angeles in March of last year. \nVideo and DNA evidence from the California crime helped law enforcement connect Morin’s murder to Martinez-Hernandez. Authorities in Tulsa, Oklahoma, arrested Martinez-Hernandez and extradited him to Maryland. \nMaryland State Sen. Johnny Ray Salling, R-Baltimore County, is one of 24 convention delegates in Milwaukee. Salling told Capital News Service on July 11: “We have a problem with crime along the border. We have criminals that are coming to our nation that are just, not committing crimes, that theyre murdering people.” \n“We had it here in Maryland, as you know, in Harford County,” Salling said, referring to Morin’s death. “I think thats a major issue of security, of public safety.” \nDespite high profile cases like Morin’s, the popular conservative theory that immigrants disproportionately commit violent crime is not based on statistical evidence. \nA 2020 white paper by the CATO Institute, a libertarian think tank, investigated whether immigrants in Texas commit more or less violent crime than U.S. citizens. \nThe paper concludes: “Whether one focuses on criminal convictions, arrests, or the number of individuals convicted or arrested, the results are the same: illegal immigrants have a lower crime rate than native-born Americans in Texas.” \nThe CATO researchers note that Texas is the only state to record criminal arrests and convictions by immigration status. \nDespite the lack of data to support a larger trend, conservative officials and pundits point to Morin’s case and others  like the February murder of Georgia nursing student Laken Riley  to underscore what they call “Biden’s Border Crisis.”\nAt the convention Tuesday night, Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, mentioned Rachel Morin in a list of women allegedly murdered by immigrants, alongside Riley and Kate Steinle of San Francisco. \nFox News host Sean Hannity invited Rachel’s mother Patricia Morin to his show following Martinez-Hernandez’s arrest. \n“It’s like we’ve opened our doors and you let a stranger into your house,” Patricia told Hannity of U.S. border security. “We’re not protecting ourselves, we’re not protecting our families.” \nPresident Joe Biden has not reached out to the family, according to Randolph Rice, their attorney. \nTrump called the Morin family in June to express his condolences and later invited Patricia, Rachel’s sister Rebekah and Rice to lunch June 30 at his Virginia club. \nRice told CNS that the family supports Trump’s candidacy and “continues to support anyone willing to make changes at the southern border that will prevent another murder like Rachel’s.\nTo a crowded convention floor Tuesday night, Michael Morin concluded: “I pray that we hold worldly leaders accountable for safety and justice for innocent people. I pray that we make our country safe and secure in the memory of my sister Rachel, who loved life.”\nMILWAUKEE  The theme of the second night of the Republican National Convention was Make America Safe Again, where speakers talked about border policy and, pictured here, Michael Morin spoke about the murder of his sister, Rachel Morin. (Caley Fox Shannon/Capital News Service)\nMaryland Gov. Wes Moore, a Democrat, and former Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, a  Republican, both reached out to the Morin family last month to offer condolences for Rachel’s death. \nOn June 24, fourteen Republican state delegates signed a letter to Moore urging him to increase coordination between local law enforcement and ICE. The letter, which Del. Ryan Nawrocki, R-Baltimore County, posted on Facebook, opened with Morin’s murder. \n“The tragic and unnecessary death of Rachel Morin has profoundly impacted our community,” the letter reads. “She was a mother who was brutally raped and murdered by an illegal alien from El Salvador, a violent criminal with a prior warrant for murder who should have never been in the country in the first place.”\nMartinez-Hernandez is charged with first- and second-degree murder, first- and second-degree rape, kidnapping and third-degree sex offense. He is being held without bond at the Harford County Detention Center as he awaits trial, which is scheduled for October. \nOn July 9, State Attorney Alison Healey filed a notice to seek the maximum penalty of life without parole for Martinez-Hernandez."

    "title": "GOP Convention Notebook: A fix-it billboard, (far) out-of-state cops &#038; more",
    "content": "MILWAUKEE  Remember when former President Donald Trump called Milwaukee, which is hosting the Republican National Convention, a horrible city?\nThat was in mid-June during a closed-door meeting with Republican lawmakers but reported by news outlets.\nOr how about when the Chicago Sun-Times reported, also in June, that law enforcement officials were preparing for Trump to stay in his Trump International Tower  Hotel during the Milwaukee convention  a plan that was reversed when reporters started asking about his 90-miles-away sleepover?\nWell, theres a billboard here aimed at trying to soothe hard feelings in a city that Trump lost by 59 points four years ago.\nThe billboard (pictured above) says: I love Milwaukee, I have great friends in Milwaukee.  President Trump.\nThe message was paid for by the Republican National Committee.\n(Far) out-of-state cops\nThe nations capital hosts a Police Week once a year, when law enforcement organizations converge on the nations capital to commemorate fallen officers and to talk to lawmakers and administration officials about legislation and policy.\nMilwaukee is hosting its own version of Police Week during the Republican National Convention.\nThe Milwaukee Police Department, the U.S. Secret Service and other federal agencies are getting additional help from about 4,000 law enforcement personnel from 24 states and the District of Columbia, according to a tally compiled by the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.\nMarylands contingent includes officers from the Carroll County Sheriffs Office and the Prince Georges County Sheriffs Office, the newspaper reported. The District of Columbia has contributed officers with the Metropolitan Police Department.\nOur intrepid Capital News Service team also spotted United States Capitol Police, which makes sense given the number of Republican members of Congress at the convention.\nAs we write this in a local coffee shop, three officers from the Miami-Dade Police walked in. Out on the street, we have said hello to officers from Tulsa, Nashville, Austin and even Fresno, California. The Massachusetts State Police are here, as are the California Highway Patrol, the Tennessee Highway Patrol, the New Jersey State Police, the Colorado State Patrol and dozens of other police departments large and small.\nNixons the One!\nThe Richard Nixon Library  Museum, which is in the 37th presidents birthplace of Yorba Linda, California, has a small exhibit in the Baird Center, adjacent to the convention.\nAnd on the tables were free campaign buttons and bumper stickers from Nixons presidential campaigns, including the iconic red-and-white 1968 Nixons the One! button. We say campaigns because one style of button looked old enough to be from Nixons unsuccessful 1960 White House bid against John F. Kennedy.\nThe people in charge of the exhibit insisted the campaign memorabilia was authentic  no reproductions. The only newer items were Nixons the One! fans.\nPoet no-reate\nAmong the many, many, many souvenirs being sold at the convention is the first volume (!) of poetry by the greatest poet of our generation.\nThat would be Donald J. Trump.\nA fellow trying to sell the green-covered hardcovers told curious passersby the price was $45.\nA delegate patiently listening and looking at the book delivered his verdict: My wife would kill me if I bought that.\nCapital News Service Washington Bureau Chief James R. Carroll contributed to this report."

    "title": "Republican delegates hail Vance as right Trump veep pick",
    "content": "(Video by IMANI AGBIONU, Capital News Service)\nMILWAUKEE – Delegates at the Republican National Convention certified Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance Monday afternoon as Donald Trump’s vice presidential running mate, a pick that stirred resounding endorsements from Maryland and other state delegations.\n“I couldnt be happier. A great selection, Im 100% for it,” Jerry DeWolf, a delegate from Washington County told Capital News Service on the convention floor. “Im just so excited to be here. And Im proud that President Trump is fighting for America. Im proud that Senator J.D. Vance gets to fight right alongside him.”\nIn a brief statement to CNS, State Sen. Johnny Ray Salling, R-Baltimore County, said: “We are very happy with Senator J.D. Vance. We support our President Donald Trump and his nominee as vice president.”\nTrump announced his decision Monday afternoon to tap the author of the memoir “Hillbilly Elegy” and the once-outspoken critic of the former president as his running mate.\nFollowing a unanimous ‘aye’ from the floor of the Fiserv Forum several hours later, House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-Louisiana, officially confirmed that Trump and Vance will be the GOP standard-bearers in November.\nVance stood at the front of the Ohio delegation alongside his wife Usha, waving to the crowd with misty eyes.\nMaryland delegates were active on social media following the announcement. CNS relied heavily on public posts by Maryland convention delegates as Maryland GOP Executive Director Adam Wood directed the delegates not to speak to the media without his approval. Wood asked CNS to submit pre-screened questions, which is not a customary practice by news organizations.\n“Great!!” Maryland State Del. Kathy Szeliga wrote on X after the Vance announcement.\n“Well, I guess he’s done with the @BankingGOP…” Maryland delegate Don Murphy posted on X, referring to Vance’s membership in the U.S. Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee.\nMaryland delegate Vikki Birkett echoed the delegation’s excitement on Facebook: “JD Vance in the house!” The post was accompanied by a photo of Vance wading through a throng of delegates reaching to snap a photo on the convention floor.\nWhile a public supporter of Trump, Vance has not always backed him in private. In 2016, Vance alluded to the idea that Trump might be “America’s Hitler” in a Facebook message to his former college roommate, Georgia State Sen. Josh McLaurin.\nMcLaurin released a post on X Monday afternoon reiterating his distaste for Trump’s new running mate.\n“I’m the guy JD Vance sent the ‘America’s Hitler’ text to in 2016. He was my roommate in law school,” McLaurin wrote. “Obviously he’s a sellout, but the bigger deal is he’s angry and vindictive. The perfect fit for Trump’s revenge. JD’s rise is a triumph for angry jerks everywhere.”\nVance, a graduate of Yale Law School, has changed his once anti-Trump-tone in recent years after the former president endorsed his 2022 run for United States Senate.\nRegarding Vances flip to a Trump supporter, Florida State Sen. Ileana Garcia, a convention delegate, told CNS: “It wouldnt be the first time that they see the light.”\nThe 39 year-old Marine veteran brings a youth to the Republican ticket that other contenders for the position – Marco Rubio, 53, Tim Scott, 58 and Doug Burgum, 67 – did not.\nGregory Fuller, an alternate delegate from Salinas, California, said “J.D. Vance has a short but stellar record, I would say, in terms of his political career. And I’m looking forward to seeing how it goes.”\n“He brings what we need to the ticket,” Ohio delegate Janet Creighton said moments after Vance’s nomination became official. “He brings youth, intelligence, and hes a leader.”\nCreighton added that she would have been happy with any of the final candidates for the vice presidential spot. Some delegates from Florida, on the other hand, did not agree.\n“I wish it would have been Rubio,” Garcia said. “It’s what President Trump deems fit…I hope that J.D. Vance continues to help our cause, which is the freedom cause.”\nVance did not address the convention before an afternoon recess was called. He will deliver an acceptance speech later in the week.\nTrump was in Milwaukee but did not speak to the convention Monday. He is scheduled to deliver his nomination acceptance speech to close the convention on Thursday night."

Capital News Service attempted to contact the people detailed below but, with one exception, they either did not respond to requests for interviews or declined interviews because the Maryland Republican Party required reporters to submit questions in advance. CNS follows standard journalistic practice and does not submit pre-screened questions in interviews.\nNicole Beus Harris, wife of Rep. Andy Harris, is serving as the chairwoman for the Maryland GOP at the convention. She arrived in Milwaukee ahead of the convention’s start on Monday sharing in a July 10 FaceBook post that she was attending the RNC chairman's session at the RNC summer meeting.\nBeus Harris’ political career began in 2011, when she worked on State Sen. Nancy Jacobs’ unsuccessful 2012 congressional campaign, according to her website. She later worked on state legislative races, was a staffer in the Maryland Senate and has been a political consultant. To this day, Beus Harris works on campaigns.\nMaryland Republican National Committeeman ​​David M.

    "title": "After Trump rally shooting, Maryland politicians across spectrum decry violence",
    "content": "MILWAUKEE  After a shooting at a Pennsylvania campaign rally Saturday left one attendee and a gunman dead and former President Donald Trump injured, Maryland officials on both sides of the aisle expressed support for victims and outrage at the act of political violence.\n“I condemn in the strongest possible terms what has happened in Pennsylvania today to President Trump,” Maryland Gov. Wes Moore, a Democrat, said in a statement. “Political violence is never acceptable. Ever.”\nMinutes into a Trump rally in Butler County, Pennsylvania, gunshots rang out through the crowd. Speaking at the podium, the former president suddenly put his hand up to his right ear before crouching to the ground as gunfire continued. Secret Service agents rushed to create a protective barrier before quickly escorting Trump offstage and into a vehicle. \nTrump later said in a Truth Social post Saturday evening that a bullet pierced the upper part of his right ear.\nHogan, an outspoken critic of Trump, confirmed last month that he will skip the party’s national convention, as he did in 2016. \nThe Republican National Convention is scheduled to begin Monday in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.\n“Five days from now we will officially accept the Republican nomination for president of the United States, Trump said moments before gunfire began.\nAn alleged gunman and a spectator are dead, according to a statement from the Chief of Communications for the Secret Service, Anthony Guglielmi. Two other rally attendees were in critical condition according to Guglielmi.\nNicole Beus Harris, Maryland Republican Party chairwoman and wife of Rep. Andy Harris, R-Maryland, wrote on Facebook that her party stands with Trump and wishes him a speedy recovery. Of the Secret Service and law enforcement that responded on the scene, Beus Harris said, “We support them and thank them for the difficult job they do.”\nMaryland State Delegate Kathy Szeliga, who is representing the state’s first congressional district as a delegate to the convention, wrote on X Saturday evening: “Prayers for Pres Trump. They say he will be fine. Thank GOD. Someone tried to assassinate him! Hopefully, no one else was hurt and Trump will be 100%. Cant wait to see him on Thursday!”\nReince Priebus, chairman of the MKE 2024 Host Committee, said in a statement that guests have already begun to arrive in Wisconsin, and we look forward to working with the Republican National Committee to welcome everyone to Milwaukee this week.\nPrince George’s County Executive Angela Alsobrooks, the Democrat who is running against Hogan for Senate, said on X that the nation must come together to “condemn this kind of political violence.”\nMaryland Democratic Sens. Ben Cardin and Chris Van Hollen both condemned all acts of political violence shortly after the news broke Saturday through social media posts.\n“There is no place for political violence or violence of any kind in our nation,” Van Hollen said on X.\nMaryland Senate President Bill Ferguson, a Democrat, said his thoughts are with Trump and other victims of the attack, according to a statement provided through a spokesperson.\n“This is not the country I want. This is not who we want to be as Americans for the rest of the world to see,” Ferguson said.\nRep. Kweisi Mfume, D-Maryland, took the incident as a chance to point to the larger conversation of gun laws in the country.\n“Despite our extremely different ideological beliefs, fortunately former President Donald Trump survived today’s sniper attempt,” Mfume said. “Political violence underscores again the need to get guns and semi automatic rifles off the streets of America.”\nLaw enforcement officials say the shooting remains under investigation as an attempted assassination, according to the Associated Press.\nCapital News Service reporters Joey Barke, Sapna Bansil, Angel Gingras and Kiersten Hacker contributed to this report."

    "title": "Amid controversy, Supreme Court shows surprising unanimity in most rulings &#8211; so far",
    "content": "WASHINGTON– As the 2023-2024 Supreme Court term nears its end, data reflects historic unanimity among the justices, although a number of potentially divisive cases are to be decided in the coming weeks.\nCasual observers may be surprised to learn that the justices this term so far have issued unanimous decisions in nearly 75% of their rulings.\nBut with about two-thirds of decisions this term still pending, the 6-3 conservative majority is more than likely to shrink that unanimity percentage. A number of historic cases on the court’s docket deal with individual rights – specifically First Amendment issues – that have been a major theme this term and are an ideological flashpoint among the justices.\nTwo high-profile decisions that are pending and highly unlikely to be unanimous deal with access to the abortion drug mifepristone and former President Donald Trump’s claims of absolute immunity from prosecution.\nThe nation’s highest court has had unanimous decisions on 17 of the 23 cases decided so far.\nBy April 17 – the date of the last decisions before hearing final oral arguments for the term – the court had reached a more than 80% unanimity rate on the 18 cases it had decided. The last time the court had three or fewer dissents in its first 18 decisions was nearly a century ago, in 1934, Empirical SCOTUS found.\nA court seeking consensus\nSupreme Court experts say two factors may explain, in large part, the unanimity seen so far: a slow term and fewer cases on the docket.\nThe only things we know for sure are that the justices are “moving slowly and are generally in agreement,” Adam Feldman, creator of the blog Empirical SCOTUS, told Capital News Service.\nA variety of factors can account for the court being slower in releasing decisions, including former President Donald Trump’s unexpected Colorado primary ballot case, in which his lawyers successfully argued to keep him on the ballot.\n“Questions related to the election…those were sort of unexpected at the beginning of the term, and those take up a lot of time and resources. So that slowed things down as well and made this term more eventful,” Feldman said.\nThe court is considering a total of 60 cases this term, compared to 74 cases during its 2019-2020 term, Ballotpedia reported. In the early 1980s, the court decided more than double the number of cases it does now.\nA fewer number of cases could indicate the justices’ desire to take on cases with national impact where splits might be more common, scholars said.\nSince the overturning of Roe v. Wade in 2021, marking the end to the constitutional right to an abortion, the court has taken on a number of other contentious cases.\n“When you have justices who are more in agreement, they think that they have other justices who agree with them on issues (so they) might take cases that are a little bit riskier in their eyes if they didnt have the numbers,” Feldman explained. “So that might be one reason why weve seen such big cases in the last few years.”\nThe high court in recent years has been pushed and pulled by competing forces: while justices have looked for unity, the spotlight has been on highly controversial cases and criticism of some justices’ personal lives, scholars said.\n“We’ve seen a high number of agreement among the justices in the cases that they have issued, high numbers in unanimity and relatively few dissents thus far,” said Christopher Schmidt, law professor at Chicago College of Law and co-director of the Institute on the Supreme Court of the United States. “The shadow of Dobbs is still playing (and probably) will play a role into the future – the justices (are) looking for opportunities to demonstrate agreement, to demonstrate that theyre not always dividing along predictable ideological lines.”\nThe court heard a number of oral arguments centering on ideological issues this term.\nConsequential cases\nThe court heard two abortion cases this term. One case challenges access to the abortion pill mifepristone, and the other questions whether federal law preempts an Idaho statute that criminalizes most abortions in the state.\nAnother case, United States v. Rahimi, will test the constitutionality of barring gun ownership for those subject to domestic violence protective orders.\nJustices tend to “veer off in ideological directions” in such cases, Feldman said.\n“The conservative justices have a certain vision of individual rights, sometimes expanding or sometimes contracting,” Schmidt said. “All the justices do have a sense of institutional responsibility. The idea generally is that the institution of the court is best served by the court being selective in when they weigh in to highly controversial issues in controversial ways.”\nInstead of the traditional 6-3 split between conservative and liberal justices that was common in high-profile cases last term, some scholars predict a 3-3-3 division is likely to be more frequent in coming rulings.\nFirst Amendment issues\nThe justices heard a number of First Amendment cases, including two cases dealing with whether social media platforms can restrict users or posts based on the authors’ views.\nSchmidt said that there is a general skepticism toward strong government regulation on the court, a thread that can be found among both the liberal and conservative justices.\n“The court is kind of hesitant to draw these wide, even bright-line rules,” said Kevin Goldberg, First Amendment specialist at the Freedom Forum. “They are aware that all of their rulings have implications down the line, but they tend to take things very narrowly and discreetly right now in these First Amendment cases.”\nFuture expectations\nAs the court has lately become more “acutely aware of how it’s perceived,” Goldberg said, efforts to publicize the justices’ friendliness may influence the court’s priorities.\n“Their efforts to publicize that is an indication that they see this as something that is especially important at a time when the court’s getting a lot of criticism about what they’re doing,” Schmidt said.\nSomething to look out for is which pattern is more likely to trend this term: the 6-3 split common in 2021 or the less fractured court in 2022, Feldman said.\nChief Justice John Roberts “has been trying to really urge the court toward more unanimity, toward fewer of these 6-3 divided cases,” Schmidt said. “This will be another moment to assess how effective he is in that effort.”"

    "title": "Statehood activists push for Puerto Rico status vote",
    "content": "WASHINGTON – Statehood activists are once again pushing Congress to set up a vote for Puerto Ricans to pick a new status for the territory.\nPuerto Ricans are U.S citizens, abide by the Constitution and are subject to federal laws. However, the over three million people who live on the island have no voting representation in Congress nor a voice in the presidential election.\nOne bill could change Puerto Rico’s status forever  if it can get through the divided Congress.\nThe Puerto Rico Status Act would set up a binding plebiscite, or referendum, for Puerto Rican voters to choose among statehood, independence or “sovereignty in free association with the United States.” The result of this election, which would be held in November 2025, would trigger the federal government to act according to the election result.\nThe legislation is sponsored by Sen. Martin Heinrich, D–New Mexico, who said the legislation is experiencing “record-breaking” support in the Senate.\n“This is about equality,” Heinrich said during an April 30 news conference. “This is about American citizens being treated with the same level of rights and dignity no matter where they live.”\nThe Puerto Rican territorial government has hosted six non-binding plebiscites since the turn of the 20th century. In the three most recent plebiscites – in 2020, 2017 and 2012 – a majority voted for statehood. Over 52% of voters chose statehood in 2020.\nIndependence has had an unpopular track record in past plebiscites, never attaining more than 5.5% of the vote.\nHowever, for a change in territorial status, Congress, which has the power to grant statehood, needs to step in.\nThe Puerto Rico Status Act was previously approved by the then-Democratic controlled House in December 2022 but was never put on the floor in the then-Republican controlled Senate. The bill passed the House with the support of 16 Republicans and 217 Democrats.\nWith party control now swapped, the Senate is the focus of proponents of the legislation. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D–NY, is among the 25 senators co-sponsoring the legislation.\nAnother bill, by the same name, aims to set up a similar plebiscite but adds an option for Puerto Rico to remain as a commonwealth. The bill is sponsored by Sen. Roger Wicker, R–Mississippi, and has no co-sponsors.\n“Many Puerto Ricans prefer to maintain their current status and want the freedom to decide on their own terms,” Wicker said in a Sept. 28 statement.\nHowever, George Laws Garcia, the executive director for the Puerto Rico Statehood Council, said keeping the territory’s current status isn’t an option for many Puerto Ricans who struggle with limited federal assistance from programs like Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.\nAs a result of these disparities, he said, underpaid healthcare workers are moving to the U.S. mainland, the local economy suffers from a lack of stimulus funds, and the island experiences higher child poverty and food insecurity.\nPuerto Rican Gov. Pedro Pierluisi agrees that island residents are leaving because of the lack of federal resources available to the commonwealths residents.\n“It’s untenable. In their hearts they would rather stay in Puerto Rico. We cannot blame them,” Pierluisi said during the April 30 news conference.\nThe lack of funding, Laws Garcia said, is a direct result of Puerto Rico’s lack of representation in the federal government.\nIn the House, the territory has a resident commissioner – Jenniffer González-Colón – who can serve and vote in committees, speak on the House floor and sponsor legislation. But she cannot vote on the floor.\nOther than González-Colón, Puerto Rico has no direct representation in Congress outside of shadow senators and delegates who cannot vote in committees or in floor votes.\nIf Puerto Rico separated from the United States, Laws Garcia said, a mass exodus to the mainland would occur, with families wanting the protections that come with being U.S. citizens.\nCurrent humanitarian problems on the island would be exacerbated and many families would be separated if the territory was granted independence, he said.\nPermanent departures from the island increased after hurricanes and other natural disasters hit the island. The population decreased by almost 12% from 2010 to 2020, according to the United States Census Bureau.\nLaws Garcia moved from his home of Puerto Rico when he was 18, something he said he has found both challenging and sad. He said he had learned about the injustices his island faced as a territory and wanted to help solve the disparities by moving the territory to statehood.\n“Until we resolve that issue, we wont ever be able to meet our full potential,” Laws Garcia told Capital News Service.\nThe United States has controlled Puerto Rico since the Spanish-American War ended in 1898.\nSince Puerto Rico’s admittance as a territory, five states have been admitted to the union. Hawaii and Alaska were both admitted as states in 1959 after residents voted to join the Union, similar to the proposal laid out in Heinrich’s legislation.\nThe other U.S. territories – American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands and the U.S. Virgin Islands – have delegates to Congress but not full voting rights.\nWith a divided Congress, Laws Garcia said it’s unlikely that the Heinrich bill will move forward. However, this Congress is about creating the conditions for future approval, he said.\nSen. Joe Manchin, D–West Virginia, told El Nuevo Dia, the territorys largest newspaper, that a hearing on the Puerto Rico Status Act will be held “as soon as possible,” which Laws Garcia said could be the first hearing in the Senate in over a decade.\n“Congress is holding United States territories on behalf of the American public,” Laws Garcia said. “Every single American stateside has a stake in this issue, no matter how remote the territories may feel.”"

    "title": "Some Maryland households face disconnect from federal discount internet program",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  Over 287,000 Maryland households risk losing access to high-speed internet at the end of this month unless a bipartisan agreement can be struck in Congress to extend a discount program.\nAround one in eight Maryland households benefits from the Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP), which provides a monthly discount on high-speed, broadband internet costs to qualifying homes. Marylanders have saved $8.3 million on monthly internet bills statewide, according to the White House.\nThe Biden administration is pushing Congress to support an extension of the broadband program.\n!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r=0;r\nPresident Joe Biden last October requested an additional $6 billion in funding for the program.\nLast month, he made public appeals for support in tweets.\n“During the pandemic, we saw just how essential high-speed internet really was — from telemedicine, online school, and small business e-commerce to the ability of millions to work remotely and connect with one another when it wasn’t safe to gather,” Biden said.\n“It’s past time Republicans in Congress joined their Democratic colleagues and worked to pass funding for this essential program.”\nA bipartisan effort by 17 senators to amend the Federal Aviation Administration reauthorization bill to include $6 billion for the internet program failed Thursday. Senate leaders resisted efforts to include the program and other non-aviation-related amendments in the FAA measure.\n“Congress must take action to save the ACP to lower costs for American families, boost the economy, and promote job creation and economic mobility,” Sen. Ben Ray Lujan, D-New Mexico, said in a statement. He was the sponsor of the amendment.\nIn the House, 122 Democrats and Republicans on Thursday wrote a letter to congressional leaders urging action to preserve the discount internet program.\n“While certain bipartisan reforms to the program are necessary to improve efficiency and effectiveness, it is the most vulnerable families across the nation that will bear the burden of our inaction if funding lapses,” the lawmakers warned.\nThe program offers internet discounts of up to $30 a month for qualifying households and up to $75 a month for homes on tribal lands, according to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). Also available is a one-time discount of up to $100 to purchase a laptop, desktop computer, or tablet from participating internet service providers under conditions.\nA Baltimore-based Twitter/X user under the pseudonym“Fearturnip” tweeted in January about the program’s pending expiration, saying, “Not only is the national Affordable Connectivity Program tanking in April, the Maryland Broadband Benefit is also ending.”\n“I guess we’re back to ‘normal,’ where the digital divide ravages America.”\nOver 23 million households nationwide have benefitted from the program, according to the software company WhistleOut, with most of the program’s beneficiaries being low-income, veterans, minorities, and seniors.\nMore than 77% of discount internet program users said losing their benefits would force them to change their internet plan or drop internet service entirely, according to an FCC survey last year.\nRep. Steny Hoyer, D-Maryland, met with St. Mary’s County leaders and county stakeholders last month to discuss his plans for keeping the internet accessible to low-income households and securing funding for the internet program.\nHoyer said he is committed to “narrowing the digital divide” and enabling everyone in Maryland’s 5th District with internet access, according to the Lexington Park (Maryland) Leader.\n“The Affordable Connectivity Program has transformed St. Mary’s County and communities across the country,” Hoyer said. “Education, health care, and our economy rely on America’s workers, students, seniors, and families being connected to the internet.”"

    "title": "House passes bill to exclude non-citizen representation, add citizenship question to census",
    "content": "WASHINGTON — The Republican-led House Wednesday passed a bill to add a citizenship question to the decennial census and exclude non-citizens from the population count used to determine federal representation.\nNo House Democrats voted for the bill, which passed along party lines 206-202. The vote sends the bill to the Democratic-controlled Senate, where it is unlikely to move forward.\nCensus data determines the number of congressional districts in each state and the amounts of federal funding distributed to each state.\n“Common sense dictates that only American citizens should be counted for electoral apportionment,” House Speaker Mike Johnson, R–Louisiana, said in a statement after the vote.\nJohnson said including non-citizens in congressional reapportionment rewards illegal immigration and cities with relaxed immigration policies with more representation.\nHowever, Democrats argued Wednesday that the bill would unfairly harm people who came to the country both legally and illegally with less federal funding and weaker representation of their communities.\n“We don’t need to start finger-painting on the Constitution with this silly election-year proposal,”  Rep. Jamie Raskin, D–Maryland, said on the House floor. “This is a land that is built on immigration.”\nThe census last included a citizenship question in 1950. During his presidency, Donald Trump attempted to add the question to the 2020 census but was blocked by the Supreme Court.\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D–New York, was critical of the citizenship question in 2019 when he accused Trump of “intimidating communities of color.”\nHouse Republicans want only the number of U.S. citizens in an area to count for representation. If enacted, this legislation could decrease federal representation for states with large immigrant populations, including California, Florida, and Texas.\n“The mere presence of illegal immigrants in the United States is having a profound impact on the outcomes of elections, skewing the representation of Americans,” Rep. Chuck Edwards, R–North Carolina, said on the House floor.\nEdwards, the bills sponsor, added that non-citizens have no allegiance to the United States and should not count for representation.\nRep. Nanette Barragán, D–California, countered that adding a citizenship question would have a “chilling effect” on census participation by immigrant communities.\nOpponents of the bill said that immigrant communities might be afraid to answer the census with a citizenship question over fears of being reported to law enforcement agencies.\n“This would deprive immigrants of representation and resources,” Barragán said.\nJohnny Zuagar, president of the American Federation of Government Employees Census Council 241, told Capital News Service Tuesday that Trumps push for adding the question to the 2020 census caused chaos and difficulty for census workers.\nZuagar said U.S. Census Bureau employees had to work hard to regain trust in immigrant communities.\n“Our staff has done a great job of just trying to build relationships throughout the country with different groups, especially Hispanic groups,” Zuagar said. “We just don’t want to add more challenges.”\nCensus employees cannot legally provide identifiable information to anyone, including law enforcement."

    "title": "House votes to consider bill to add citizenship question to census",
    "content": "WASHINGTON – Since 1790, the Census Bureau has taken a head count of every person, regardless of citizenship, in the United States so Congress can determine how members of the House of Representatives and Electoral College votes are distributed.\nHouse Republicans want to make this process a thing of the past.\nThe House Tuesday voted 205-199 along party lines to consider a bill that could add a citizenship question to the decennial census and exclude non-citizens from the population used to calculate congressional district representation.\nThen-President Donald Trump pushed to add the citizenship question to the 2020 census but was blocked by the Supreme Court in 2019 over concerns about dishonest disclosure of the reason behind asking the question.\nThe census last asked the entire population about citizenship status in 1950. Since then, the government has presented a citizenship question to a sample of households through the American Community Survey and an occasional added survey to the census.\nThe census is not only used to determine the number of House members and Electoral College votes per state, but also to decide how to distribute federal resources across the country.\nDemocratic lawmakers, including New Mexico Rep. Melanie Stansbury, said the citizenship question itself could make non-citizens afraid of filling out the census, leading to a decrease in federal funding and representation.\n“These counts would have devastating implications for not only our electoral system but the well-being of our families and communities,” Stansbury said Tuesday during debate on the House floor.\nRepublicans, such as New York Rep. Nick Langworthy, argued that including non-citizens in the population for apportionment rewards illegal immigration and is unfair to U.S. citizens.\n“Allowing non-citizens to vote dilutes the voice of the American citizen and opens the door for manipulation and exploitation of our electoral system,” Langworthy said.\nRemoving the weight of non-citizens in the distribution of federal representation could change the party divide in the House.\nStates with large immigrant populations – namely California, Texas and Florida – would each have had one less representative if “unauthorized immigrants” had been excluded from the post-2020 census apportionment, according to a 2020 Pew Research Center report.\nThe 14th Amendment states that the apportionment of representatives is determined by a count of the “whole number of persons.”\nRep. Jamie Raskin, D–Maryland, said during a House Rules Committee meeting Monday that the bill was unconstitutional under the 14th Amendment, adding that the bill would exacerbate the undercount of the Hispanic population.\n“This bill would destroy the accuracy of the census,” Raskin said.\nThe 2020 census had a statistically significant undercount of Hispanics in the United States, with almost 5% not counted, according to Census Bureau reports. This undercount has been attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic and fears that answers to census questions could be shared with other agencies.\nThe Census Bureau cannot legally share any identifiable information with anyone, including law enforcement.\nHowever, Rep. Erin Houchin, R–Indiana, said Tuesday that since the proposed legislation would still allow counting non-citizens in the census, the change would not greatly impact federal assistance or an accurate count of the population, calling such claims a “red herring.”\nA 2019 Census Bureau report said a question asking about citizenship is sensitive for non-citizens and could affect the self-response rate.\nBeyond the impacts of political representation, Johnny Zuagar, president of the American Federation of Government Employees Census Council 241, told Capital News Service that the bill, even if not passed, could complicate the jobs of census employees and the underfunded Census Bureau.\nBringing up the possibility of a census citizenship question again, Zuagar said, will likely make immigrants unsure of if they can trust the Census Bureau not to report them to immigration authorities.\nCensus workers would have to take time to explain the citizenship question and the safety of the responses, Zuagar said, complicating their work.\nDuring the 2020 census, he said, census employees had to work with immigrant communities to regain that lost trust.\n“Were just here to measure the country and follow the Constitution. You can trust us,” Zuagar said.\nThe House will likely vote on the bill this week. If passed in the House, the measure would move to the Senate, controlled by the Democrats."

    "title": "Van Hollen, other Maryland Democrats and teachers slam Tennessee law arming educators",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  Maryland federal and state lawmakers, as well as local education groups, are speaking out against allowing teachers to carry firearms in classrooms, adding that they are confident that a bill allowing such a practice won’t come to fruition in the state.\nThe simple truth is that the vast majority of Americans want commonsense reforms like stronger background checks and an assault weapons ban to keep our schools safe from the epidemic of gun violence,” Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Maryland, said in a statement.\nHe added: “Despite that, some legislators continue to press for policies like this one in Tennessee to allow for concealed carry for handguns on school grounds. Its a misguided and dangerous approach that undermines the safety and well-being of both students and educators.”\nMaryland is one of 14 states and the District of Columbia to have some type of law preventing school boards from giving K-12 educators the authority to carry firearms, according to the nonprofit firearm training organization Faster Saves Lives.\nMaryland law prevents anyone from carrying or possessing a firearm in public and private K-12 schools, according to the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, a nonprofit based in California.\nThe law was extended to higher education institutions in March 2023.\nTennessee is the most recent state to pass legislation in stark contrast to Maryland’s law.\nTennessee Gov. Bill Lee signed a law on April 26 allowing teachers and other school staff members to carry firearms on school grounds. The law was passed after three 9-year-old students and three adults were killed last March in a shooting by a former student at the Covenant School in Nashville, Tennessee.\n“There are no circumstances where educators should carry weapons on school property,” said Cheryl Bost, president of the Maryland State Education Association. “Our educators are trained professionals in the field of education. And thats what we want to do in our classrooms and our work sites, whether that’s bus drivers, secretaries or teachers.”\nTo carry firearms on school premises, Tennessee teachers still need approval from their school’s director and principal. Educators would also have to obtain a handgun permit and complete at least 40 hours of approved training from the Police Officer Standards and Training Commission in addition to the 40 hours of basic training.\n“That is a pretty insignificant amount of time,” said Maryland Del. Jared Solomon, a Democrat. “Considering the amount of time that law enforcement has to train and create scenarios and figure out how to confront these kinds of situations.”\nSolomon started his career as a high school teacher in Baltimore City before moving to the policy side of education. He believes that another problematic aspect of Tennessee’s bill is that it won’t allow parents to be notified if their students’ teachers are carrying guns.\n“If you didnt want your child in a classroom with a teacher that was carrying a gun, you wouldnt have that option, which I think is not really parental choice,” Solomon said. “I know certainly, I would not want my child in a classroom where the teacher is carrying a weapon.”\nMark Pennak, president of the gun owners’ rights organization Maryland Shall Issue, doesn’t see Tennessee’s law as a problem.\nPennak believes that teachers serve as the “first line of defense for students” and that those willing to be trained and who are able to carry a gun should be allowed to.\n“The whole idea of concealed carry is that the mass killer intruder does not know who is armed,” Pennak said in an email. “If the information is shared with parents, that advantage will disappear and the armed teacher would be in the same position as the uniformed school resource officer  the first target.”\nPennak added that programs, like the nonprofit organization FASTER, help train school faculty to ensure that they are not risking the students’ safety.\n“Trained teachers do not put their children at risk,” Pennak said.“That is what the training is for. And any such minimal risk is far outweighed by the protection that an armed teacher can provide right at the outset of a school shooting.”\nThe number of school shootings in K-12 schools in the United States has increased each year from 2021 to 2023, according to the K-12 School Shooting Database created by data scientist David Riedman.\nThe database defines a school shooting as an incident where a “gun is fired, brandished (pointed at a person with intent), or bullet hits school property, regardless of the number of victims, time, day, or reason.”\nIn 2021, 256 shootings were recorded in the database. That number jumped to 308 school shootings in 2022 and 348 in 2023.\nSen. Ben Cardin, D-Maryland, said he does not believe that allowing educators and other school professionals to carry guns would solve the mass shooting epidemic in schools.\n“We do not need more guns in schools, and we do not need educators and other school professionals carrying guns,” Cardin said in a statement. “Teachers are hired to teach, not be security guards. The answer to stemming the epidemic of gun violence in our schools is not to bring more guns into the schools.”\nJaime Lennon, spokeswoman for Maryland Democratic Rep. Dutch Ruppersberger, said that the possibility of a bill like Tennessee’s being introduced at the federal level is slim. Lennon added that no research suggests that arming teachers would solve the problem.\n“Congressman Ruppersberger would strongly oppose it in any event, quite simply, because teachers have stated over and over that they do not want to carry guns into their classrooms,” Lennon said. “There is also zero scientific evidence that this is a realistic solution to an incredibly complex problem. If more guns equaled less violence, we would be the safest country on the globe.”\nMaryland Democratic Rep. Steny Hoyer said that “Marylanders have long known that the answer to stopping mass shootings does not lie in increasing the number of firearms on American streets.”\n“I’m disappointed to see this law passed in Tennessee, but I remain confident that under the leadership of Governor (Wes) Moore and our strong Democratic delegation  Maryland will continue to be a state that works towards ending gun violence once and for all,” Hoyer said.\nBoth Bost and Solomon said they were confident that the Maryland legislature will not allow teachers to carry guns in schools anytime soon.\n“Weve really instituted a lot of strong firearm safety standards and laws in the state that I think are a much better step forward than just saying were going to introduce more firearms into a school and leave that task to a teacher,” Solomon said.\nBost added that a deeper investment in school counselors and psychologists to help students deal with trauma, along with reducing class sizes to help teachers better cultivate relationships with students, could help prevent situations where students feel the need to resort to violence.\n“Guns have never been, and will never be an answer, whether its in our society or our schools,” Bost said. “It’s actually getting into our classes and providing the resources. We are doing a good job with that here in Maryland. We can always do better.”\nMaryland Del. Susan McComas, a Republican, agreed that the state would never pass a law similar to Tennessee’s legislation, adding that Maryland should consider using resources officers who can work with students.\n“There are just too many what ifs and scenarios where a teacher might be attacked by a distraught student or a group of students to get the gun,”  McComas said, referring to Tennessee’s law."

    "title": "As some lawmakers look to regulate AI fakes, free speech concerns remain",
    "content": "WASHINGTON — Music artist FKA twigs is urging Congress to ban unauthorized use of artificial intelligence to replicate her image or voice.\nThe singer, whose full name is Tahliah Debrett Barnett, said that she uses the technology herself to engage with fans in different languages or respond to press requests.\nWhat is not acceptable is when my art and my identity can simply be taken by a third party and exploited falsely for their own gain, FKA twigs told a Senate Judiciary Committee’s intellectual property subcommittee on Tuesday. Our careers and our livelihoods are in jeopardy.\nGenerative AI has been used to create songs, such as Heart on my Sleeve, which replicated the voices of popular music artists Drake and The Weeknd. Works like these take away revenue from the original artists, industry leaders argue.\nBut the problem is much bigger than that.\nAI has been used to generate sexually explicit images of Taylor Swift, emulate President Joe Bidens voice in robocalls and sell dental plans using a replica of Tom Hanks likeness.\nA bipartisan Senate bill aims to address all of these issues. The proposal would hold individuals, companies, and platforms liable if they produce or host unauthorized replicas, but includes some exceptions to protect free speech.\nSen. Chris Coons, D-Delaware, and chairman of the subcommittee, said that he created his own AI-generated song using a replica of Frank Sinatras voice.\nThe song was fun to create, Coons said, adding that he had the permission of the rights holder to do so.\nSen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina, the ranking Republican on the panel, said that he uses the generative AI ChatGPT for one hour every day as part of his news feed. Congress has to be careful not to overstep the rights of others when trying to regulate AI use, he said.\nThe current draft might infringe on First Amendment rights, experts and industry leaders warned the committee.\nBen Sheffner, senior vice president and associate counsel at the Motion Picture Association, warned of a chilling effect new regulations might have in the use of technology for storytelling. He used the example of the film classic “Forrest Gump,” which features the main character interacting with digital replicas of former presidents. That might not be possible under the proposed bill, he said.\nSheffner said a new law is not necessary, but if Congress wants to address AI issues, legislation should be narrow and deal with gaps around election fraud and sexually explicit images.\nAdding a federal layer to the existing patchwork of state laws will only exacerbate the problems, Sheffner said.\nLisa Ramsey, law professor at the University of San Diego, echoed free speech concerns. She said a new law should include specific exceptions to liability for expression protected by the First Amendment. Additionally, the current drafts basis for permitting legal action against a person or entity allegedly misusing AI is too broad, she said.\nIm glad that we are taking up this bill, Tillis said, despite the challenges to balance privacy rights and free speech. We need to get it right.\nCoons said that the committee will refine the bill in the next two weeks and he hopes to introduce it later this month."

    "title": "Democratic Senate candidate Alsobrooks aims to bring new perspective to the Capitol",
    "content": "Editors note: Capital News Service also has published a profile of Democratic Senate candidate David Trone. Read it here.\nWASHINGTON – Prince George’s County Executive Angela Alsobrooks hopes to bring a new perspective to the U.S. Senate. Maryland voters will decide on May 14 if she’s prepared to make the leap. \n“The people who are closest to the pain are also closest to the solutions,” Alsobrooks said in an April 4 Zoom interview with Capital News Service. \nThe candidate, who has served as a county state’s attorney and currently as county executive, believes that her experience being close to her constituents could bring something new to the Senate, highlighting the importance of understanding how policies impact people. \nAlsobrooks is running against Rep. David Trone and eight of less-prominent Democrats in the Maryland Democratic Senate primary. Former Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan is the Republican frontrunner. \nAlsobrooks was born in 1971 in Prince George’s County, Maryland, to a working class family. What she remembers about her childhood is how her community stressed the importance of taking care of others. \n“We had an obligation to care about the success of others,” Alsobrooks said. “That has stuck with me to really not only work hard to make sure that were improving the world.”\nShe attended Duke University for her B.A. in public policy and the University of Maryland School of Law. \nAlsobrooks started as an assistant state’s attorney for Prince George’s County in 1997, eventually becoming the county’s first full-time domestic violence prosecutor. \nDuring her time in the latter post, Alsobrooks said there was a moment when she realized that her daughter was growing up in a place less safe than the one Alsobrooks grew up in.  \nAlsobrooks said she decided that there was more she could do to address systemic issues in the county.\n“There were so many in our courtrooms and courthouses who were seeking second chances, and I realized that many of them had never had the first chance of success,” Alsobrooks said. \nShe was elected in 2010 as the Prince George’s County state’s attorney, the top law enforcement officer. Under her tenure, violent crime dropped by over 50% between 2011 and 2018, according to FBI crime data, when Alsobrooks was a part of a group of county leaders focused on crime reduction. \nAlsobrooks then won her election for county executive in 2018. \nShe takes credit for helping to build 10 new schools in the county, creating jobs and leading the county through the COVID-19 pandemic. \n“Ive done policy, but Ive also been on the implementation side,” Alsobrooks said. “We need people right now in Washington who know how to get things done, not just talk.” \nAlsobrooks accepted 46 out of 50 police reform recommendations in 2021 that came out of the county’s police reform work group. The tough-on-crime state’s attorney said that good leadership and reforms can help solve problems in the criminal justice system. \n“I believe that our families deserve to live in places where they have both justice and freedom,” Alsobrooks said. \nOnly three senators in U.S. history have been Black women. There are no women in Maryland’s 10-member congressional delegation. \nThis lack of diversity is one reason why Rep. Steny Hoyer said he endorsed Alsobrooks, someone he’s known for about 15 years. \n“I think that she will make a real contribution to the multiplicity of perspectives and opinions that weve brought to the Senate, so Im a very strong supporter of hers,” Hoyer said in an interview. \nHoyer said that the experiences that Trone has had are well-represented in the Senate, unlike those of Alsobrooks’s life. Alsobrooks has shown excellence and a passion for helping people at every stage of her career, Hoyer said. \nOne criticism Alsobrooks receives from opponents is her lack of federal political experience. \nMaryland has only elected three senators since World War II without experience in the House. However, most current senators have not served in the House, according to the Senate’s website. \nAlsobrooks stresses that she has experience working with her constituents and the federal delegation to get projects and federal funding for the county. \nIn the Senate, Alsobrooks said, she wants to be an advocate for abortion rights, economic growth for Maryland and reduced healthcare costs.  \nAlsobrooks has spent nearly $4 million dollars on her Senate campaign, according to the most recent Federal Election Commission reports. Her major donors include ActBlue and Emily’s List. She has publicly criticized the wealthy Trone of attempting to buy the election by spending $41 million of his own money on his campaign. \n“I do not believe that the people of Maryland are going to allow anyone to buy an election,” Alsobrooks said. “I think when they hear my record and vision, theyll support me.” \nTrone has criticized Alsobrooks for her support while she was state’s attorney for the death penalty in a murder case. Trone is opposed to the death penalty because he believes it is racist. Alsobrooks has since stated that she would not support a federal death penalty. \nPrince George’s County Councilmember Krystal Oriadha, who endorsed Trone, claimed in a Zoom interview that Alsobrooks as county executive has not supported policies or funded initiatives Senate candidate Alsobrooks claims to support on healthcare and LGBTQ+ pride. \n“I have to judge people off of their record,” Oriadha said. \nThe reason why Alsobrooks believes she has gained the endorsements from many top Maryland Democratic politicians – including Gov. Wes Moore, Sen. Chris Van Hollen and five House members – is that she is a good listener. \nRep. Kweisi Mfume, D-Maryland, met Alsobrooks in the 1990s on Capitol Hill. Throughout the years, Mfume said in an interview, he has been able to understand her work ethic and her values as she moved through county politics. \n“Ive supported her and everything shes ever run for,” Mfume said. “I know her soul, her mind and I certainly know her history.”\nAlsobrooks believes that she would bring something new to the Senate, both diversity and a different resumé than her competitors. Without the perspectives of mothers, women and all races, Alsobrooks said the delegation is incomplete. \n“It is really important to have varied experiences there,” Alsobrooks said about the Senate. “Until that happens, I think our policies are incomplete.”"

    "title": "Democratic Senate hopeful Trone sees himself as progressive conciliator",
    "content": "Editors note: Capital News Service also has published a profile on Democratic Senate candidate Angela Alsobrooks. Read it here.\nWASHINGTON – Rep. David Trone views himself as an outsider in Congress. On May 14, Maryland voters will decide if the three-term lawmaker, self-described progressive and wealthy businessman is the right Democrat to try to retain a Senate seat for the party. \nTrone doesn’t play golf or hold a membership to any country club, he said, but that doesn’t stop his Democratic opponents in the primary from criticizing him for being out of touch with Marylanders, PACs from calling him a “billionaire bully,” and some fellow politicians from seeing him as not a real progressive.\nHowever, Trone sees this image as almost an advantage in his efforts to reach across the aisle to Republicans. \n“Youre stereotyped because youre a white businessman so therefore you cant be progressive, but Im far and away the progressive in this race,” Trone said in an interview with Capital News Service. “But Im the progressive that gets stuff done … I reach across the aisle and figure out how to bring parties together.” \nTrone is running against Prince George’s County Executive Angela Alsobrooks and eight lesser-known Democrats in the primary. Trone and Alsobrooks by far dominate the field in spending, polls and ads. \nFormer Gov. Larry Hogan is the presumed Republican nominee for the Senate.\nTrone has represented Maryland’s 6th District, which includes Western Maryland and parts of Montgomery County, since 2019. \nIn an April 9 interview with CNS at the Democratic National Committee, Trone discussed his life, House career and what he hopes for the future. \nAs he spoke, he effortlessly rattled off various statistics and facts about his record before running off for House votes. \nBorn in Cheverly, Maryland in 1955, the congressman spent his teenage years working at his family farm near the Pennsylvania-Maryland border. After finishing his undergraduate degree at Furman University, Trone moved back to the farm, living with his father and brother. \nLife wasn’t easy for the family. His father was an abusive alcoholic, Trone said, and they lost the family farm when the future lawmaker was in his mid-twenties. \nAs Trone put himself through an M.B.A. program on a scholarship at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton Business School, he opened his first business brokering eggs and later his first beer and soda store. \nTrone eventually built an empire with Total Wine  More, his billion-dollar liquor chain that has grown to at least 266 locations across 28 states. \n“I understand the value of work better than anybody in this race, it’s not even close,” Trone said.\nMaking his fortune off of Total Wine  More gave Trone the opportunity to run for office his own way, running without relying on PAC and special interest funding. \nTrone won his first election in the 6th District in 2018 after he lost his first House race two years earlier in a primary against Rep. Jamie Raskin in the 8th District.\nTrone has spent $41 million of his own money on his Senate campaign, according to the most recent Federal Election Commission reports. Outside of his own funding, Trone received $105,000 from the American Israel Public Affairs Committee. The committee has not given him any funding since June 2023. \nTrone is a long-term supporter of Israel and has advocated for a two-state solution and a ceasefire in Gaza, positions he reiterated in an April 19 Senate debate.   \nWhile Trone acknowledged that not everyone can self-fund a Senate campaign, he said that this allows him to be truly independent and fight against the pharmaceutical industry and other major corporations. \n“Im one of the few people that can do that,” Trone said about self-funding. “Im willing to put my resources that I earned from zero and rather than giving them to my kids, I’m putting it into a campaign to change America the much better way.”\nRep. Dutch Ruppersberger, D-Maryland, works with Trone on the House Appropriations Committee and endorsed the candidate in November. Ruppersberger said he respects Trone for being a self-made person and being a hard worker on committees. \n“He still cares about helping his country and he doesnt need to do this for money or anything else,” Ruppersberger said in an interview outside of the House chamber. “He just cares about being a U.S. congressman.”\nMaryland Attorney General Anthony Brown praised Trone in an ad for the campaign.\nHe will level the playing field because he believes that everyone deserves an equal shot and he will always be there on the frontline of justice, Brown said.\nAlsobrooks, his opponent, has made headlines for her endorsements from other Maryland Democratic politicians including Gov. Wes Moore, Sen. Chris Van Hollen and five of Trone’s colleagues in the House.\nTrone said part of the reason why he didn’t receive those endorsements is because of congressional reforms he has proposed. They include instituting term limits, taking away special interest money in campaigns, eliminating stock trading by lawmakers and banning senators and House members from becoming lobbyists.\n“The politicians, theyre a part of the club…Im an outsider,” Trone said. “Theyre all politicians who pat each other on the back…I dont do any of this stuff.” \nTrone said he decided to enter the Senate race after Sen. Ben Cardin, D–Maryland, announced his retirement, presenting an opportunity to step up and be effective statewide.  \nTrone also said in a Feb. 29 speech at the University of Maryland that he wanted to switch to the Senate because senators got more done than the closely-divided House. \nTrone’s policy priorities are in mental health care, addiction, education, criminal justice reform and medical research.\nMany of these issues are personal to Trone, who is a cancer survivor, a public school system graduate and the uncle of a victim of a fatal fentanyl overdose. \nIn the last Congress, Trone said, he helped to pass 26 bills on substance abuse and mental health. \nHe funded the American Civil Liberties Union’s Trone Center for Criminal Justice in 2015. Trone became passionate about criminal justice reform after being wrongfully accused of various business violations by a Pennsylvania attorney general during his time in business school, according to the ACLU.\n“Justice was unfair to me,” Trone said. “I came out and …was able to be hugely successful. Others that are Black and Brown dont get that shot and that makes me madder than a hornet.”\nTrone’s campaign has not been without controversy. \nHe often touts his perfect record on voting for abortion protections and abiding by all Planned Parenthood requests to testify or write a letter in support of abortion access. Trone was also a supporter of an abortion clinic that opened last year in Cumberland, Maryland, across from West Virginia, which has strict abortion laws. \nHowever, Alsobrooks and other Trone opponents cite a Time magazine report last year that Trone’s firm Retail Services and Systems donated to pro-life Republican candidates, including Texas Gov. Greg Abbott. \nTrone stepped down from day-to-day operations of his businesses around 2015, he said, and funding GOP candidates was in an effort to protect his employees’ jobs. For example, he was pushing for relaxing liquor laws in Colorado in 2022. \nTrone said that in federal races, he has donated only to Democrats.\n“It was my job to protect the jobs of my folks’ thousands  of jobs in…those states that dont share our values in many, many ways,” Trone said. \nDuring a House budget hearing in March, Trone mistakenly uttered a racial slur while talking about tax rates, drawing staunch criticism online. He apologized, saying that the word should never be “used any time, anywhere, in any conversation”. \nTrone also has been labeled as a “billionaire bully” by Fight Corporate Monopolies, a progressive PAC, that ran an ad this month criticizing Trone’s actions as a businessman, including a disputed claim about threatening a delivery worker in 2021 and emphasizing that the Federal Trade Commission sued Total Wine  More last year in a monopoly investigation. \nTrone’s campaign has denied the threat allegation, saying Trone “never made the statement this organization is alleging.” The FTC settled with Total Wine  More in December.\nTrone claimed that he is the only one in this race who could beat Hogan in the general election, a race which could help determine control of the Senate. \nTrone has won in Republican areas of Western Maryland and he can therefore appeal to voters across the state, the congressman said.\nTrone also cited various recent polls that show his strength against the former governor. In nearly every poll since Hogan launched his Senate bid, Trone is the most competitive candidate against the former governor, who nevertheless is favored against both Democratic candidates. \nWhat sets him apart from Alsobrooks in this race, Trone said, are his connections in the Senate, his ability to prevail over adversity and his rejection of special interest funding in his campaign. \n“Im ready for the job day one,” Trone said. “Ive created a $6 billion business from zero and started with nothing. Nothing has ever been given to me.”"

    "title": "Outside Supreme Court, protesters argue about immunity &#8211; and more",
    "content": "WASHINGTON — Protesters clashed outside of the Supreme Court Thursday following oral arguments over whether former President Donald Trump has immunity from prosecution.\nAtop a portable grand piano, traveling classical pianist Matthew Atwood wore a traditional colonial-era outfit, complete with tricorne hat, in front of a graphic sign of international leaders he listed as “real authoritarians.”\n“If you look at the word ‘demos’, ‘demos’ in the original sense means ‘mob,’” Atwood said. “The Ancient Greeks said, and this is a fact, that democracy was to be avoided at all costs because it always leads to mob rule.”\nHis assertions about the illegitimacy of democracy and dissent against abortion were intercepted by a woman with a stickered blow-horn, shouting opposing messages over his answers to questions asked by a crowd of onlookers.\n“Biden needs to make a list and Trump should be first,” the woman, who declined to identify herself, chanted following a question about the possibility of the high court rejecting the appellate court’s ruling against criminal immunity for the former president.\nAn unidentified student engaged in the dispute with the woman, saying that inflation had increased during Biden’s presidency, but both Trump and Biden “have their goods and their bads.”\nThe woman replied, “As a female, you have don’t have any autonomy over your body, you’re a second-class citizen because of Trump. Thank Trump for that.”\nRichard Zipper, a retired software engineer from Crofton, Maryland, who regularly protests outside of the Supreme Court, later joined an argument with Atwood.\nZipper said that accountability for politicians is critical because of declining public trust in the government due to corruption, citing Judge Clarence Thomas’s vacations with wealthy republican donor, Harlan Crow, as reported by ProPublica.\n“I’m out here because I think the Supreme Court is not acting on behalf of the Constitution or the people of the United States,” Zipper said. “We have no checks and balances except on the voters.”"

    "title": "Supreme Court seems skeptical of Trump&#8217;s &#8216;absolute immunity&#8217; claim",
    "content": "WASHINGTON – The Supreme Court Thursday seemed skeptical of former President Donald Trump’s claims of absolute presidential immunity from prosecution.\nTrump’s alleged efforts to overturn the 2020 election is at the center of the case, including his actions leading to the Jan. 6 attack on the United States Capitol. After he was indicted by a federal grand jury, the former president’s attorneys argued that he could not be charged due to having “absolute immunity” from criminal prosecution.\nPresidents are immune from civil damages related to the “outer perimeter” of their duties, as the high court ruled in 1982, because civil suits could distract the president from his responsibilities. The court has not yet taken a stand on criminal prosecutions related to duties in office.\n“This case has huge implications for the presidency, for the future of the presidency, for the future of the country,” Justice Brett Kavanaugh said.\nJustices seemed focused on how their decision could impact future presidencies, either holding presidents to account or setting up a system that would be open to revenge politics.\nSome justices, including Ketanji Brown Jackson, were concerned that taking away the possibility of criminal prosecution could encourage presidents to engage in more illegal activity.\n“I’m trying to understand what the disincentive is from turning the Oval Office into the seat of criminal activity in this country,” Jackson said.\nMultiple justices – both liberal and conservative – appeared unwilling to hold the president to a standard equivalent to the rights of a monarch.\nD. John Sauer, the attorney representing Trump, argued that presidential decisions could be clouded by a fear of criminal\nprosecution.\n“That looming threat will distort the president’s decision-making precisely when bold and fearless action is most needed,” Sauer said.\nBut Jackson countered that many people have jobs where they are expected to make life-and-death consequential decisions in the workplace with the possibility of criminal prosecution.\nOther justices were concerned that setting up a system of criminal prosecution could lead to sitting presidents afraid to make difficult decisions, presidents pardoning themselves and politically-driven criminal cases.\nThe latter point brought the court, including Justices Neil Gorsuch and Amy Coney Barrett, to a discussion around how motive could be a deciding factor for future criminal cases.\n“I am concerned about future uses of the criminal law to target political opponents based on accusations about their motives,” Gorsuch said. “We’re writing a rule for the ages.”\nA significant portion of the justices questions centered around how a president’s actions can be classified as either official, subject to immunity, or private, which would not be granted any legal shield.\nJustice Elena Kagan asked Trump’s legal representation, Sauer, whether a president ordering the military to stage a coup would be considered an official act.\n“That might well be an official act and he would have to be, as Ill say in response to all these kinds of hypotheticals, has to be impeached (by the Congress) and convicted before he can be criminally prosecuted,” Sauer said.\nAfter the 2020 election, Trump, Gorsuch suggested, was at moments acting as an elected official and at others, a candidate.\nBoth conservative and liberal justices conceded that a democratic system of government relies on leaders who uphold its legitimacy.\n“A stable, democratic society requires that a candidate who loses an election, even a close one, even a hotly contested one, leave office peacefully if that candidate is the incumbent,” Justice Samuel Alito said.\nSimilarly, Justice Sonia Sotomayor noted the layers of protections the judicial system provides for defendants. She asked Michael Dreeben, attorney for Special Counsel Jack Smith, who is prosecuting Trump in two federal trials, about who bears responsibility for failures in the system.\n“In the end, if it fails completely, it’s because we destroyed democracy on our own, isn’t it?” Sotomayor asked. Dreeben agreed.\n“I think one of the ways in which abuses are limited is accountability under the criminal law for criminal violations,” Dreeben replied. “But the ultimate check is the goodwill and faith in democracy.”\nTrump’s federal trial on 2020 election subversion charges has been delayed until the court rules on his claim of presidential immunity.\nJustice Clarence Thomas, whose wife Virginia Ginni Thomas was involved in trying to stop the certification of the 2020 election, did not recuse himself from hearing the case.\nIn addition to facing felony counts of falsifying business records to influence the election in his current Manhattan trial, Trump faces criminal charges in Georgia, where he is accused of interfering with the state’s 2020 presidential election results, and in Florida, where he is accused of keeping classified documents in his Mar-a-Lago home.\nEarlier this month, the high court heard oral arguments in Fischer v. United States, which questioned the applicability of a federal obstruction charge to more than 350 Jan. 6 defendants. Trump was also charged with obstruction in his Jan. 6 case.\nThe Supreme Court could decide on the cases anytime, but most likely in June or early July."

    "title": "Maryland team on NASA project to study oceans, atmosphere",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  To better understand the ocean surface, NASA scientists went to the stars.\nThe Plankton, Aerosol, Cloud, ocean Ecosystem (PACE) satellite launched into orbit on Feb. 8 on a quest to better understand the microscopic content of Earth’s atmosphere and oceans.\n“This mission is really the search for the invisible,” NASA project scientist Jeremy Werdell told Capital News Service.\nTwo Maryland teams  from NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center and the University of Maryland, Baltimore County- and a team from the Netherlands Institute for Space Research and Airbus Netherlands B.V., each worked on one of the three instruments on the satellite.\nScientists can use PACE’s data, which was first released on April 11, for both short-term monitoring and long-term climate change analysis, according to Werdell. PACE is set to send data back to Earth 12 to 15 times every day.\nThe satellite, which is around the size of a minivan, is designed to orbit the Earth for at least three years, but Werdell said the mission might last longer.\nThe Ocean Color Instrument (OCI), a project of the Goddard team, will help researchers identify the species of phytoplankton in the oceans by looking at the color of the water across ultraviolet, visible and near-infrared light.\nPhytoplankton are a diverse range of plant-like microscopic algae living mostly on the surface of the ocean, according to the project website. While many species of phytoplankton are harmless and are key photosynthesizers, others create toxins harmful to humans and marine life.\nPACE data could help inform water quality managers, as well as the fishing and recreation industries, about the type of phytoplankton in their regions in a more sophisticated way than ever before, Werdell said. From previous satellites, he said, scientists were only able to tell where a community of phytoplankton was, not the type of phytoplankton.\nOCI’s use extends beyond the ocean. The instruments color analysis can be used to track vegetation on land and atmospheric particles, according to project science lead for the mission, Amir Ibrahim.\n“If you’d like to breathe and eat, OCI can help us understand,” Ibrahim said. “OCI is not only going to tell us how the food chain works (and how) the phytoplankton distribution works, but also …climate change.”\nThe project will give new insight into how climate change is impacting phytoplankton, and thus the rest of the planet, according to Ibrahim. Phytoplankton produce around half of the oxygen on Earth, according to the Scripps Institute of Oceanography.\nTo get to the ocean however, scientists must clear the light-reflecting haze between the ocean and the orbiting satellite.\nThe two other instruments  the HARP2 and SPEXone  are polarimeters, which focus on light bounced off of particles. Both polarimeters, the latter from the Netherlands team, identify particles in the atmosphere.\nA team from the University of Maryland, Baltimore County built the HARP2, which is focused on identifying the size and content of particles in aerosols and clouds.\nVanderlei Martins, the director of the Earth Space Institute and a physics professor at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, said he hopes the HARP2 will be used by other scientists to better understand how the atmosphere interacts with the ocean and land.\n“My hope is that the UMBC contributions … will help scientists around the world … have a better understanding of our planet and how it works,” Martins said. “It’s adding another piece of information to the puzzle.”\nThrough the HARP2, scientists can see the size and content of atmospheric droplets.\nThe PACE project is years in the making, Werdell said. He joined the project in 2015, just after it was officially launched, but PACE had been discussed for over 20 years.\nWerdell, Martins, Ibrahim and most of the team who spent countless hours working on the satellite all anxiously awaited the launch from the Kennedy Space Center at the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station.\nMartins was standing with his team on launch day, all intensely watching every update, from the launch until they saw in a live video that their instrument was still tightly secured to the satellite’s side after the launch, and finally when the first transmission came in from space.\n“Its very emotional, every single step,” Martins said.\nAfter launch day, the team spent months processing and inspecting the quality of the data until it was ready to be released to the public earlier this month.\nIbrahim said that the day the team finally got its hands on the first round of PACE data felt like Christmas morning.\n“I was like finally, I can see the data, and I really almost teared. That data is really very special,” Ibrahim said."

    "title": "Justices consider case involving visa denied to husband of U.S. citizen",
    "content": "WASHINGTON – Supreme Court justices seemed conflicted Tuesday during oral arguments over whether a U.S. citizen can challenge the denial of a visa for a noncitizen spouse because the government expected that spouse to engage in unlawful activity.\nThe State Department in fiscal 2023 denied almost 5,400 visa applications from noncitizens attempting to live with their citizen spouses or fiances using the unlawful activity, according to the agency’s attorney, Curtis Gannon.\nThe high court is being asked if denying a visa for a noncitizen impinges on the U.S. citizen spouse’s constitutionally protected interests and if simply citing the law behind a visa denial provides a sufficient reason for that denial.\nThe case centers on Sandra Muñoz, a California attorney, who married El Salvadorian citizen Luis Asencio-Cordero in 2010.\nIn 2015, the U.S. consulate in San Salvador denied Asencio-Cordero’s visa application. This was done under the provision that an officer can deny visas to anyone believed to be to enter the country to engage in unlawful activity.\nThe couple was not told why the consular officer believed that Asencio-Cordero was likely to engage in this activity until after the one-year deadline to respond to the denied visa expired.\nThe State Department revealed in 2018 that the decision hinged on Asencio-Cordero’s tattoos and the consular officer’s belief that the body art linked Asencio-Cordero to the criminal gang MS-13, a fact that the couple and a court-approved gang expert refuted.\nA consulate’s visa denial is not subject to judicial review unless the denial interferes with constitutionally protected interests of a U.S. citizen, according to the American Bar Association. Muñoz’s interest in this case is in her marriage and living with her husband, Muñoz’s representative, Eric Lee, argued.\nThe State Department appealed this case to the Supreme Court in an effort to prevent having to further explain visa denials under the unlawful activity standard in other cases, citing security concerns.\nDuring oral arguments, justices seemed somewhat convinced of Muñoz’s constitutional interests in her marriage but less so about what the State Department should have done differently regarding providing reasons for the visa denial.\nThe State Department argued that Muñoz did not have a significant enough interest to trigger review of the consulate’s decision.\n“The U.S. citizen is affected only indirectly by the governments action against the noncitizen,” Gannon told the justices.\nHowever, Supreme Court cases going back over a century guarantee constitutionally protected rights of marriage, including the rights for couples to live with one another, Justice Sonia Sotomayor said.\nSotomayor said that while Muñoz doesn’t have a constitutional interest in having a visa granted, she does have an interest in her marriage, having her husband visit and getting information about why the visa was denied.\n“Youre saying shes entitled to nothing. Why do we have to go that far?” Sotomayor said. “Why dont we just address, given all of our centuries of statements about marriage being something more?”\nGannon argued that providing more information other than what provision triggered the denial could pose a national security threat. Citing reasons for why applicants, as in this case, are thought to be gang members could publicize U.S. intelligence on criminal organizations, he said.\nChief Justice John Roberts latched onto this argument during his questioning of Lee, pressuring Lee to weigh the constitutional interests of Muñoz with the government’s interest in denying visas people who present a danger to the country.\nLee said that additional information about visa denials would allow citizens to properly refute false accusations. If his client had known which gang Asencio-Cordero was believed to be associated with, Lee said, then the couple’s representatives would have been able to analyze his tattoos and provide more proof of his innocence- which included Catholic imagery and Sigmond Freud  and with more specificity.\nJustices, including Elena Kagan, pressured Gannon on how much information they can provide about visa denials  including asking for one sentence as an explanation.\n“One sentence gives you a lever to try to contest an inaccuracy in what the government is doing, and the other gives you no lever at all,” Kagan said.\nDuring the arguments, numerous justices critiqued Lee’s arguments that focused mostly on statutes instead of the Constitution.\n“I dont think you can answer this constitutional question by citing statutes,” Justice Samuel Alito said.\nIf the court were to rule in Muñoz’s favor, Lee said in his opening statement, he hoped the government would allow her to formally refute the claim against her husband and have another chance for approval.\n“Shes been permanently separated from the man that she loves for eight years without having any basis, any chance when there was an opportunity to respond under the regulations, to try and convince them that they made a mistake,” Lee said.\nKeren Zwick, the director of litigation for the National Immigrant Justice Center, agreed with Lee’s position and said in a statement that she believes this case is about the right to due process.\n“The right to due process is fundamental to our legal system, and were hopeful that the Supreme Court will recognize that in this case,” Zwick said.\nIf the ruling aligns with the State Department’s wishes, the court would recognize that the department upheld the existing standards and provided sufficient reason for the visa being denied, Gannon said.\nHe also pushed the court to recognize that a U.S. citizen does not have interests which would trigger judicial review pertaining to a non-citizen spouse’s visa.\nThe court is expected to rule on this case in June."

    "title": "Can cities punish homelessness? Supreme Court justices seem divided",
    "content": "WASHINGTON — In what advocates call the most important case on homelessness in 40 years, the Supreme Court must decide whether cities can punish the unhoused for sleeping in public when they have nowhere else to go.\nThe case comes from the small Oregon city of Grants Pass, which prohibits sleeping in public with so much as a blanket. After three homeless people filed a complaint, courts have blocked the city from enforcing the rule.\nGrants Pass, supported by dozens of other cities and states, wants the Supreme Court to overturn a decision by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, which ruled that punishing homeless people for sleeping outside when they have nowhere else to go violates the Eighth Amendments ban on cruel and unusual punishment.\nTheane Evangelis, the lawyer representing Grants Pass, told the justices in oral arguments Monday that the city needs to protect its public spaces, but the lower courts ruling has tied its hands to address public health and safety.\nIf the Supreme Court affirms the decision, the city will have to surrender public space while local shelter beds go unused, she said.\nJustices Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson, who make up the liberal minority, appeared to strongly oppose the citys fines for homeless people sleeping on public property.\nEvangelis argued that the camping ban, which includes setting down a blanket to sleep, applied to everyone. Sotomayor rejected that claim, citing the testimony of the Grants Pass police officers, saying they hadnt ticketed anyone who wasnt homeless.\nMuch of the discussion revolved around whether sleeping in public is an inextricable part of being homeless or a behavior that can be outlawed.\nEvangelis insisted that sleeping outside is considered conduct.\nYou could say breathing is conduct too, but presumably, you would not think its okay to criminalize breathing in public, Kagan replied.\nSotomayor asked what would happen if all cities and states passed laws like the citys public sleeping ban.\nWhere are (homeless people) supposed so sleep? Are they supposed to kill themselves (by) not sleeping? Sotomayor said.\nIf sleeping is protected from fines because it is a biological necessity, the ruling could have broader implications, parties siding with Grants Pass argue.\nIts next logical application is urination and defecation, which are ‘biologically compelled’ no less than sleep is, said a brief signed by 24 states that was filed with the high court.\nChief Justice John Roberts wanted to know if someone suffering from hunger could be prosecuted for stealing food.\nJustice Neil Gorsuch expanded that argument and asked if public urination and defecation would be protected if there were no public bathrooms.\nKelsi Corkran, who represented the homeless people of Grants Pass, argued that stealing food or urinating in public are not inextricably linked to the state of being homeless, but sleeping outside is.\nShe pointed out that cities can still punish homeless people for refusing to go to a shelter if a space is available to them.\nAll justices seemed to agree that fines and imprisonment will not solve the homelessness crisis.\nWhen you get out of jail… whats going to happen then? Justice Brett Kavanaugh asked. You still dont have a bed available. So how does this help?\nNevertheless, the conservative majority seemed skeptical of blocking city laws that deal with homelessness.\nMaryland is among six states in the case that is supporting the Grants Pass people experiencing homelessness. A brief filed by Attorney General Anthony Brown states that policies criminalizing sleeping in public just move the problem elsewhere and might even increase homelessness by imposing debts through fines and creating criminal records.\nMaryland is outside the Ninth Circuit Courts jurisdiction. But if the Supreme Court sides with the homeless residents of Grants Pass, Maryland cities would be blocked from punishing homeless people for sleeping outside when they have nowhere else to go.\nAt least one Maryland city has such a law on the books. The city of Fredericks ordinances prohibit laying down bedding and sleeping in public. A violation of these rules is punishable by a fine of up to $1,000 or six months in jail.\nIt is unclear whether the city enforces the law. The communications department didnt return multiple emails and calls asking about enforcement.\nThe nation has seen unprecedented levels of people living and sleeping outside. Unsheltered homelessness affected over 250,000 people on any given night in 2023, according to the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development.\nCriminalizing people is ineffective. Arresting people makes it worse and is a really expensive way to not solve homelessness, said Sarae Lewis, who is the principal of communications and campaigns at the non-profit Community Solutions, which works with over 100 cities nationwide to reduce homelessness.\nThe Supreme Court is expected to issue a decision by the end of June."

    "content": "ELLICOTT CITY, Md. — Workers at the Shipley’s Grant Starbucks cafe voted to unionize this week, just days ahead of a Supreme Court case involving the company’s challenge of a federal labor injunction.\n“I started working here two and a half years ago, and as soon as I got here, I knew something had to change,” said Noah Smith, a shift supervisor at the Shipley’s Grant shop, which voted 21-2 on Thursday afternoon to unionize. Smith was one of the first three workers at the store to speak with Workers United about organizing the staff.\nDwindling hours coupled with increasing traction of unionization of Starbucks workers across the nation influenced Smith and his coworkers to initiate a union petition, which they filed with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) on March 19.\nData compiled by UnionElections.org shows that 9,270 Starbucks employees are covered by a union — accounting for a bit less than three percent of the company’s total workforce.\nThe Shipley’s Grant location became the ninth Starbucks cafe in Maryland to unionize. Staff at more stores in the state are expected to go public with unionization efforts in the coming months.\nWorkers at a Starbucks location in Buffalo, New York, made history as the first unionized store in the company when they voted to organize with Workers United in 2021. Over 400 Starbucks locations have unionized since then, spanning 43 states and the District of Columbia.\nIn early 2023, corporate-level decisions led to reduced hours among the workers at the Shipley’s Grant cafe. While full-time employees saw only marginal schedule changes, part-timers came face-to-face with the possibility of losing health care benefits and access to free education — both offered to staff members working a minimum of 20 to 22 hours a week.\nThe team of 27 employees has a tough time ensuring every staff member works enough throughout the week to receive benefits, according to Smith. He added that workers often need to pick up shifts at other stores to meet the quota.\nSmith said that one of the primary goals of unionizing was to establish a dialogue with the corporate leaders at Starbucks, setting clear guidelines about minimum working hours and clearer expectations for employees.\nAnother focal point of the unionization effort is to create a more inclusive work environment at the cafe. Smith shared a story about a recent directive from the store’s district manager to remove a Progress Pride Flag the workers had hung up in the store.\nSince the staff went public with its petition to unionize, Smith said that Starbucks management also began enforcing a dress policy prohibiting workers from wearing union t-shirts on the clock.\nAt other locations, the company has taken more serious action against union promotion, going as far as firing pro-union employees at several stores, NLRB judges have ruled.\n\nIn total, the NLRB has taken legal action in more than 700 unfair labor practice cases leveled against Starbucks by employees — the majority of which were filed in the last couple of years.\nStarbucks issued a statement: On February 27, the company and Workers United agreed to begin discussions on a foundational framework designed to help achieve ratified bargaining agreements, resolve certain litigation and address other issues.\nWe are eager to reach ratified agreements in 2024 for stores that have already voted for union representation, the company said. We respect the rights of our partners to organize and bargain collectively, and we are eager to reach ratified agreements in 2024 for represented stores.\nStarbucks Corp. most recently lost an appeal in the District of Columbia Circuit Court in which the company challenged an NLRB ruling to stop interfering with workers’ unionization efforts at a Seattle location.\nThe Supreme Court case involves a suit by Starbucks against the NLRB involving company actions against workers at a store in Memphis, Tennessee, in 2022, including the firing of seven employees for allegedly associating with the Workers United union.\nIn October 2023, Starbucks filed a petition for the case to be heard by the Supreme Court, which was granted in January. The question presented by the company to the court is to determine whether NLRB injunctions should be subject to the same standards in all jurisdictions.\nAs it stands, injunctions filed by the board are evaluated by courts in some jurisdictions using a two-factor test, whereas other jurisdictions use a four-factor test to determine if they are warranted. An affirmative decision in this case would establish the four-factor test in all jurisdictions.\nBoth parties will present their arguments to the court on Tuesday.\nOnce the Shipley’s Grant vote is certified by the NLRB, the cafe’s staff will join nationwide bargaining discussions affecting unionized Starbucks workers across the United States.\n“Im not going to be here forever, but the next people that come behind me, I want them to have a store thats safe and inclusive and open and with them,” said Smith."

    "title": "Lawmakers tangle over Biden pause on new LNG terminals",
    "content": "WASHINGTON – House Republicans criticized the Biden administration Thursday for its temporary pause in liquified natural gas (LNG) export applications, citing negative impacts on the economy and international relationships.\n“This administration’s pause has caused a great alarm and uncertainty, particularly with our European allies,” said Rep. Pat Fallon, R-Texas, and chairman of the House Oversight and Accountability Committee’s economic growth, energy policy and regulatory affairs subcommittee. “The United States LNG producers and exporters are rightfully alarmed by the pause. They need predictability in order to move forward into the future.”\nGOP lawmakers are proposing legislation, sponsored by Rep. August Pfluger, R-Texas, to repeal restrictions on the import and export of natural gas.\nGraphic by Capital News Service\nBrad Crabtree, assistant secretary for the Energy Department’s Office of Fossil Energy and Carbon Management, told the panel that the administration’s pause, which started in January, is a response to the U.S. success with LNG exports.\n“This context makes clear why it is so important that we take this moment to evaluate the impacts of authorizing further exports beyond the very large volume of exports that we have already approved,” Crabtree said.\nCrabtree was confronted by numerous Republican House members  including some not on the subcommittee  representing LNG-producing states.\n“You realize, of course, that the actions that you have taken on behalf of your executive, for whom you work, has (impacted) thousands and thousands of American lives and jobs,” said Rep. Clay Higgins, R-Louisiana.\nThe United States is the world’s top LNG exporter.\nIn 2022, Higgins’ state of Louisiana, along with Texas, produced nearly 80% of all LNG exports from the United States. The nation saw a 12% increase in LNG exports from 2022 to 2023, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (USEIA).\nAttorneys general from Louisiana, Texas and 14 other states sued the Biden administration in March over the pause.\n“Prior to the executive’s (Biden’s) interference, the American LNG industry had been feeding reliable, affordable, clean energy to our allies across the world,” Higgins said.\nMaryland accounted for about 3.5% of total U.S. LNG exports in 2022, all coming from the state’s one LNG terminal in Cove Point, the USEIA reported.\n“Because of various interruptions that have been planned and calculated, interruptions to American energy production and dominance and export, our European allies have had to rely on other sources for their raw energy product to power their grids across the continent,” Higgins charged.\nThe world’s largest LNG exporters behind the United States are Australia and Qatar, with Russia and Malaysia trailing behind, according to the USEIA.\n“Isn’t it in the public interest to cripple Russia’s LNG exports?” Rep. Mike Waltz, R-Florida asked Crabtree. “If we drop the price of global oil and gas below a certain point, Russia’s done…Iran is done…”\n“We are crippling (Russia’s) capacity because we are doubling our exports between now and 2030, sir,” Crabtree responded.\nHouse Democrats endorsed the Biden administration’s pause on LNG exports, saying greenhouse gas emissions and disproportionate damages to disadvantaged communities were key considerations.\n“We are all here today talking about a drop in the LNG export bucket compared to the massive expansion in export capacity the Biden-Harris administration has already enabled,” said Rep. Eleanor Holmes Norton, D-D.C. “This whole endeavor is just one more chapter in the majority’s false claim that the Biden-Harris administration is waging some sort of ‘war on energy.’”"

    "title": "To prod congressional action, bill would cut lawmakers’ pay after mass shootings",
    "content": "WASHINGTON   In February, Steve Kraske, a radio host at NPR’s Kansas City affiliate, was on air discussing the Kansas City Chiefs Super Bowl parade shooting that left one woman dead and more than 20 others injured.\nKraske mentioned that he surveyed his 25 students at the University of Missouri, asking them if they would attend another parade if the Chiefs won the Super Bowl next year. \nAll of them said no. \nThis caught the attention of Rep. Emanuel Cleaver, D-Missouri, and led to him re-introducing the No Pay Until Peace Act in March. If the bill passes, members of Congress would have their pay reduced each time there is a mass shooting until lawmakers take action on gun safety reforms.\n“Whenever theres a mass shooting, the congressional action is swift,” Cleaver told Capital News Service. “We have somebody go down to the well of the House and say, ‘We offer our thoughts and prayers,’ and that is the congressional reaction to mass shootings no matter how many people get shot or how old they are.” \nThe bill was initially introduced in 2022, and Congress took no action on it. Cleaver believes that the recent lack of progress on federal gun legislation has left some Democrats discouraged.\n“People are apprehensive just because (they believe) nothing good is going to happen,” said Cleaver. “So theres no need of getting your heart broken again.” \nCleaver has received support from Democrats for trying to change congressional inertia when it comes to gun safety reforms. However, Republicans haven’t been as encouraging.\n“I can’t say that I am surprised, as the vast majority of them have opposed any and all action in regard to reforming the nation’s gun laws,” Cleaver said in an email. \nHe added that while the bill currently has no sponsors, he could get 100 signatures without Republican support. The election season has halted his efforts.\n“This is an election season so I’m not going to have some members try to respond, putting them in a tough spot where they say ‘I’m going to be a supporter’ and then all of a sudden the (National) Rifle Association will come after them,” Cleaver said.\nMark Pennak, president of the gun owners’ rights organization Maryland Shall Issue, believes Cleaver’s re-introduction of the bill is a “publicity stunt.”  Pennak said that the bill assumes that gun control legislation favored by Cleaver is effective in stopping mass shootings. \nWhile federal background checks are necessary, Pennak said, they don’t deter people who get weapons by illegal means.\n“The criminals aren’t going through licensing to buy their firearms,” said Pennak, who spent 33 years as lawyer in the U.S. Department of Justice. “That just isn’t happening. They go to Baltimore on the street and they buy their firearms illegally. Most of these people are already disqualified people. Otherwise, they cant legally possess firearms.” \nFrom 2010 to 2019, Baltimore County had the fifth-highest gun death rate among Maryland counties and Baltimore City, according to the Educational Fund to Stop Gun Violence.\nBaltimore City had the highest gun death rate. \nWhile federal law requires background checks to buy firearms at any federally licensed gun dealer, only 40% of guns sold in the United States are through such dealers, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics. That leaves firearms sales among private dealers unchecked in many states.\nGun theft in Maryland currently falls under the general theft statute, with the level of the crime and the penalty based on the value of the stolen item. As a result, stealing a firearm valued under $1,500 is usually considered a misdemeanor. \nOn first and second offenses, gun theft is typically punished by probation, Pennak said. Consequently, prosecutors are hesitant to waste time on it, he said. \nEarlier this year, Maryland State Sens. Justin Ready, Jack Bailey, Mary Beth Carozza, Paul Corderman and several others introduced a bill to make gun theft a felony. However, it was not acted on during the legislative session. \nCleaver said that legislation strengthening gun theft penalties and other policies protecting communities from gun violence are worthy considerations. \nHe hopes that the legislation gets the public to be less supportive of lawmakers who “care more about their own pocketbooks and personal ambition” than the lives lost in shootings.\nWith the House controlled by a Republican majority that has opposed significant gun safety proposals, prospects for passage of Cleaver’s bill this year are very poor."

    "title": "Whistleblowers warn Congress of alleged safety lapses at Boeing",
    "content": "WASHINGTON – Boeing Co. quality engineer Sam Salehpour on Wednesday raised concerns about manufacturing shortcuts taken by the company, warning a Senate panel that the flying public could be at risk.\nThere have been issues with the Boeing 787 Dreamliner program since 2013, according to Salehpour. Thousands of gaps in major joints of the planes’ fuselages are not being closed, he said. Boeing’s standard says that these gaps must be closed and are usually closed using shims, or filler when they exceed five-thousandths of an inch.\n“When you are operating at 35,000 feet… the size of a human hair can be the matter of life and death,” Salehpour told the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations.\nBoeing pushed airplane pieces together using excessive force, making it appear as though the gaps don’t exist when they actually do, which could result in premature metal fatigue failure, he said.\n“Effectively they are putting out defective airplanes,” the whistleblower charged.\nAccording to Salehpour, gaps on 29 inspected 787 planes were not properly addressed 98.7% of the time. When these gaps are drilled through, they fill with debris. Data from the same 29 inspected planes showed that the gaps were filled with debris 80% of the time, Salehpour said.\nA Boeing spokesperson earlier told The Hill that the company is cooperating with the subcommittee.\n“We have offered to provide documents, testimony, and technical briefings, and are in discussions with the subcommittee regarding next steps,” The Hill quoted the spokesperson as saying.   Safety and production quality at Boeing have been under scrutiny following a blowout of a door panel on an Alaska Airlines 737 Max 9 in January.\nOther witnesses criticized government agencies and their involvement in these safety incidents.\n“Theres a reason commercial aviation has been historically safe and thats because people worked extremely hard for decades,” Ed Pierson, a former Boeing manager and executive director at the Foundation for Aviation Safety said during the hearing. “To keep them safe, they told the truth, they admitted their mistakes. They didnt downplay safety incidents. These agencies have become lazy, complacent and reactive.”\nPierson also criticized the National Transportation Safety Board for being “overly dependent” on Boeing and the Federal Aviation Administration, which he sees as a conflict of interest. He added that the Department of Transportation has been “completely useless” in helping the FAA do its job and has continued to take a hands-off approach.\n“The FAA could have prevented an ever-increasing list of production quality defects,” Pierson said. “Instead, theyre surprised each time that occurs, showing how ineffective and reactive their oversight has become.”\nSalehpour emphasized that he had raised concerns to Boeing about production and safety for the past three years, but was ignored, was told not to create delays and to “shut up,” he said.\n“It is unbelievable to me that in the midst of this safety crisis at this corporation that what theyre doing is threatening their own engineers whose job it is to help identify potential safety concerns,” Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Missouri, said.\nSalehpour had worked on the Boeing 787, raised concerns, and was then transferred to the Boeing 777. His worries were ignored in both cases, he said.\nAfter sharing concerns with his boss, Salehpour said he received threatening calls on his personal phone and felt like his safety was threatened. He said he was told by his boss, “I would have killed someone who said what you said in the meeting.”\nDespite threats and risks to his personal safety, Salehpour said he feels at peace knowing that if something were to happen to him, he feels that by coming forward he will have saved a lot of lives.\n“This investigation has to include not only Boeing, its got to include how airlines maintain Boeing products, but its also got to look at the FAA and government and where government has potentially dropped the ball as well,” Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wisconsin, said.\nSubcommittee Chairman Richard Blumenthal, D-Connecticut, said he hopes the FAA will testify in a hearing in the future.\nBoeing CEO Dave Calhoun last month announced his intent to step down at the end of the year. The aircraft manufacturer also has undergone other recent management shakeups."

    "title": "Supreme Court appears divided over using obstruction statute against Jan. 6 defendants",
    "content": "WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court justices seemed divided Tuesday while hearing oral arguments over whether a federal obstruction law applies to more than 350 people involved in the Jan. 6 attack on the United States Capitol.\nIf the court strikes down a law used to charge Joseph W. Fischer and other Jan. 6 rioters, a maximum 20-year prison term would be off the table for Jan. 6 prosecutions and two of former President Donald Trump’s federal charges would have to be dropped.\nIn the most in-depth Jan. 6-related case before the high court yet, the justices heavily questioned the scope of the obstruction law and its applicability to Jan. 6 defendants.\nThe case comes a week before justices hear oral arguments over whether Trump is immune from prosecution altogether.\nNotably, Justice Clarence Thomas – whose wife, Ginni Thomas, was in touch with White House officials after the 2020 election in efforts to support the overturning of the results – did not recuse himself from Fischer’s case.\nThe Department of Justice charged Fischer with seven crimes, including violating Section 1512(c), which penalizes anyone who destroys or conceals documents with the intent to affect official proceedings or “otherwise obstructs, influences, or impedes any official proceeding, or attempts to do so.” The law carries a maximum 20-year prison term.\nJeffrey Green, who argued on behalf of Fischer, a former Pennsylvania police officer, claimed that the obstruction statute should be read more narrowly as it has a focus on evidence and investigations.\nThe government had a broader interpretation of the law. Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar told the justices: The case as it comes to this court presents a straightforward question of statutory interpretation: Did (the) petitioner obstruct, influence or impede the joint session of Congress? The answer is equally straightforward. Yes, he obstructed that official proceeding.\nA great portion of the arguments revolved around the “otherwise” portion of the law, which has statutory history.\nChief Justice John Roberts defined “otherwise” in a narrow light, meaning “in other ways.”\nIn Begay v. United States, the court ruled on the usage of the term “otherwise” in the Armed Career Criminal Act. Roberts ultimately ruled in favor of the majority’s narrower reading, while Thomas and Justice Samuel Alito did not – an indication that the conservative wing of the court may be split on the issue.\nGreen used Begay as part of his argument Tuesday, which prompted a response from Alito.\n“Well, Im not a fan of Begay. Some of us perceived at that time that there were problems, different problems, with what the court did there,” Alito said. “We need to find out what are the outer reaches of this statute under your interpretation.”\nJustice Elena Kagan clearly expressed her reading of “otherwise,” saying that the writing of the statute is not about precision, but rather what “otherwise” covers from the first half of the statute.\n“Similar conduct, obstruction of a proceeding, different ways of carrying out that similar conduct, which is obstruction of a proceeding,” Kagan said. “The statute tells you what the similar conduct is right on its face.”\nNumerous justices posed hypothetical scenarios in assessing what acts are covered under the obstruction statute.\n“So what if on Jan. 6 the Capitol itself had not been breached,” Justice Amy Coney Barrett asked Prelogar, “the protest is going on outside the Capitol, ‘stop the steal, stop the steal,’ police are, you know, in megaphones saying, ‘disburse, disburse,’ they are too close to the Capitol, their goal is to impair, impede, stop the proceeding, stop the counting of votes. Does that violate the statute in your view under this impede language?”\nThomas, who returned to the bench after an unexplained absence Monday, questioned the applicability of the statute in question in other cases involving a protest.\n“General, there have been many violent protests that have interfered with proceedings. Has the government applied this provision to other protests in the past, and has this been the governments position throughout the lifespan of this statute?” Thomas asked Prelogar.\n“It has certainly been the governments position since the enactment of 1512(c)(2) that it covers the myriad forms of obstructing an official proceeding and that its not limited to some kind of evidence impairment gloss,” Prelogar responded. “We have enforced it in a variety of prosecutions that dont focus on evidence tampering.”\nBarrett also raised the larger question of whether potential First Amendment challenges arise from obstruction law.\n“The government wants to unleash a 20-year maximum penalty on potential peaceful protests. That in and of itself is a bad idea because its going to chill protected activities,” Green said. “People are going to worry about the kinds of protests they engage in, even if theyre peaceful, because the government has this weapon.”\nOver 20 members of Congress filed a brief in support of Fischer, including Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Arkansas, and Republican Reps. Jim Jordan of Ohio, Matt Gaetz of Florida and Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia.\nTrump’s presidential immunity case is scheduled to come before the high court on April 25.\nThe Supreme Court is expected to rule on Fischer’s case in June."

    "title": "Washington church marks 176th anniversary of greatest attempted slave escape",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  Rev. Brian Hamilton tapped his microphone, signaling the beginning of his service at Westminster Presbyterian Church in honor of the 176th anniversary of the greatest attempted escape of enslaved people in American history — which happened in Washington.\n“Resistance is a mandate then and now…you and I have a ton of work to do,” Hamilton told the eager Sunday crowd.\nSeventy-seven enslaved men, women, and children made the abortive attempt on April 15, 1848, to flee the slave-holding District of Columbia for freedom in the North.\nThe church has been commemorating the event for four years.\nIt was a Saturday evening when the 77 enslaved people gathered to board a two-masted vessel called The Pearl. A formerly enslaved man named Daniel Bell drew up the escape plan after he and his wife lost a case to free their six children through the court system, according to the history YouTube channel CuriousPeople.\nBell contacted abolitionist Capt. Daniel Drayton, who agreed to lead the ship’s journey and rounded up as many enslaved people as he could ahead of their departure. Full families snuck away from their plantations, beating Washington’s 10 p.m. curfew for all Black residents, and boarded the ship.\nDrayton intended to sail down Washington’s southwest waterfront and down the Potomac River to the Chesapeake Bay and break north to freedom, according to The Pearl Initiative, a Washington community group dedicated to spreading awareness about the escape.\nBut meager winds prevented the ship from sailing away to safety. Without the cover of darkness, The Pearl was spotted the following morning by a slaveholder who noticed several of his slaves were missing and overtook the ship with a mob on his steamboat Salem, according to CuriousPeople.\nThe 77 escapees were shackled, returned to Washington, and resold by their owners to Southern plantations. Many families were separated during the tragedy. Records detail the lives of a few after their capture.\nA woman named Grace Russell was among the captured. Her family saved her at an auction in Richmond, Virginia, but could not afford to save her sister, Emily, when she was sold two years later by the same person who enslaved Grace, according to The Pearl Initiative.\n“Oh mother, my dear mother, come see your distressed and heartbroken daughter once more,” wrote Emily Russell to her mother from Bruin Jail in Alexandria, Virginia. Emily Russell died soon after on a coffle traveling to the South.\nWestminster Presbyterian Church was founded in 1853, five years after The Pearl incident.\n“This is extremely important for us because Westminster is totally committed to inclusion and diversity… So the Pearl project was a natural when we realized that this whole thing happened right in our backyard,” Hamilton said.\nThe institution of the church historically has served as a forum for social justice initiatives and community-building for African Americans. Churches have played an instrumental role in mobilizing political action, such as during the civil rights movement. \nWashington native Sonia Adams brought her son Joseph to The Pearl remembrance so he could learn African American history. She had seen a brochure about the event at a local library.\n“Social justice wouldn’t be what it is without the African American church because that was our basis,” Adams said. “That was the framework for social justice here in America and continues to be…It plays a role because you have community and the community is working together to solve this problem.” \nThe story of The Pearl helped to fuel the abolitionist movement and inspired anti-slavery publications.\nAuthor and renowned abolitionist Harriet Beecher Stowe began her 1852 novel Uncle Tom’s Cabin as a series of installments in a Washington newspaper.\nWhile raising money to try to free members seized aboard The Pearl, Stowe produced a follow-up novel in 1854 called The Key to Uncle Tom’s Cabin. The book told stories of enslaved people, including those on The Pearl, to dispel national skepticism of the conditions she described in her previous novel.\nHamilton and The Pearl Initiative held a procession on Monday at Washington’s southwest waterfront with community members to read the names of the passengers on The Pearl and toss flowers into the Potomac as a tribute.\nDr. Christopher Williams, a resident of the neighborhood and board member of The Pearl Initiative, said that during his time at the organization, people told him that they did not know the story of the escape attempt on the ship.\nWilliams said that the story of The Pearl invites Americans to “return to their origin story.”\n“We cannot be that kind of society where we fail to remember…Given how highly consequential The Pearl escape was, it would not be in our interest to forget and not be able to contextualize these historic figures,” Williams said. “If we become ignorant of history, who are we really? Do we really know who we are? Do we really know ourselves?”"

    "title": "After pandemic decreases, share of Black people in Maryland prisons peaks",
    "content": "The coronavirus pandemic caused a historic drop in Marylands prison population. But after the state of emergency ended and prisons filled up again, the share of Black incarcerated people reached a five-year-high late last year, a Capital News Service data analysis has found.\nIn March 2020, around 18,500 people were incarcerated in the state’s prisons. By summer 2021, there were almost 4,000 fewer prisoners. Never before had the state prison population decreased so dramatically in just one year.\n!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r=0;r\nSince then, the prison population has swelled again to more than 16,000 people as of last October — still significantly lower than pre-pandemic levels.\nBlack inmates accounted for 72.4% of state prisoners in the last quarter of the fiscal year 2023, although Black people make up less than a third of Maryland's population overall.\nThe share of incarcerated Black people is up from 70% in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 and higher than the 72% at the beginning of the pandemic, data by the Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services reveals.\n!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r=0;r\n\"One percentage point in this context is quite substantial,\" Brennan Klein, associate research scientist at Northeastern University, told CNS. Since prisons incarcerate large populations, even small changes can be significant, he added.\nKlein was the lead author of an earlier study published in the science journal Nature that found sharp increases in the share of Black and Latino prisoners at the beginning of the pandemic across the nation. Maryland was among only five states that did not follow the national trend.\nIn fact, the share of Black prisoners declined while Maryland was under the coronavirus state of emergency. Only after it ended, the percentage of Black people incarcerated in state prisons climbed.\nIn October, Maryland Attorney General Anthony Brown and Public Defender Natasha Dartigue announced a new partnership to reduce mass incarceration of Black people in the state.\n\"It is a sad reality that the vast majority of people who have been removed from communities across the country and put behind bars are Black,\" Brown said in a press release.\nThe Maryland Equitable Justice Collaborative, which brings together government, academic and criminal justice experts, will present plans for reforms early next year.\nFour years ago, then-Gov. Larry Hogan issued an executive order to slow the spread of the coronavirus in prisons.\nThose scheduled to leave within the next four months were eligible for early release. Incarcerated people over the age of 60 were considered for accelerated parole if they had a good record, a home plan and had not been convicted of a violent crime or sexual offense.\nAccording to the DPSCS, 484 people were eligible to leave prison. Department spokesperson Latoya Gray said that Hogan's executive order made accelerated placements in home detention possible. According to her, placements stayed 30% higher a year after the first executive order.\nA second Hogan executive order came in November 2020, again allowing early releases for a fraction of prisoners.\nThese early releases likely had a negligible effect on the total size of prison population.\n\nThe number of prison intakes, however, dropped sharply in the first pandemic year. Right before the coronavirus hit Maryland in March 2020, the intakes hovered around just under 450 per month. In April, only three people were incarcerated. All of them were Black men.\nIn the same month, 515 people left state prison. A lack of intakes while releases continued caused a significant reduction in the state's prison population.\n﻿\nNationwide, lower crime rates and court closures halted incarceration early in the pandemic. This caused a historic drop in prison populations, but also exacerbated racial inequalities, according to Klein's study.\nKlein traced back racial disparities to differences in sentence lengths. Black people are more likely to serve long sentences and White people tend to be incarcerated for shorter periods.\n\"On any given day, if someone's being released, they're more likely to be White,\" Klein said.\nMaryland data shows that Black prisoners are much more likely to serve sentences longer than 25 years. According to Klein, the pandemic effect was weakened because the state hands out fewer short sentences overall, slowing down turnover that mostly benefited White prisoners in other parts of the nation.\n\nStill, racial disparity in Maryland prisons is more than double the national average, according to a 2019 report by the Justice Policy Institute, a think tank that aims to reduce mass incarceration.\nThe Justice Policy Institute found that incarcerated people disproportionately come from poor communities such as Southwest Baltimore. A 2022 report established a connection between incarceration and neighborhoods with high unemployment, low income and fewer people with a high school diploma.\n\"Instead of investing in those communities, the state has invested into the justice system,\" said Keith Wallington, director of advocacy at the Justice Policy Institute.\nExperiencing the spread of the coronavirus behind bars was scary, people incarcerated in Maryland told researchers.\nPoor ventilation and close quarters can contribute to the spread of infectious diseases such as COVID-19, Lauren Porter, associate professor of criminology and criminal justice at the University of Maryland, told CNS.\nAccording to the Covid Prison Project, Maryland prisons had a lower COVID-19 death rate than the general population. Again, the state was an outlier.\nThose leaving prison at the height of measures against the pandemic faced challenges as well.\n\"There's an incredibly high risk of death immediately following release, especially from things like overdose,\" Porter said.\n\"The liquor store was open during COVID, but not the reentry programs,\" said Janette Graham, founder of the reentry service organization No Struggle No Success. During the stay-at-home orders, newly released people couldn't immediately access in-person services, such as substance abuse therapy, she said.\nJacob Kang-Brown, research fellow at the criminal justice nonprofit Vera Institute of Justice, said that the tight labor market might have actually helped those trying to re-enter society after serving time in prison.\nHe predicted that states will continue to explore large releases of people from prison \"as a way to correct years and years of heavy sentences.\""

    "title": "DC domestic violence shelter prepares to celebrate 45th anniversary",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  A group of women spent several months painting, applying wallpaper, removing poison ivy from the backyard, and making other final alterations and repairs to a huge three-story Victorian house in the nation’s capital. \nThe home would go on to serve as one of the first undisclosed safe spaces for women and children dealing with domestic violence. Opening with 15 beds in about five bedrooms in 1979, the shelter relied on many volunteers and about four regular staff members. \nToday, the organization known as My Sister’s Place serves all domestic violence victims in Maryland, Virginia and the District of Columbia. It is preparing to hold its 45th anniversary celebration in May. \nThrough both its emergency shelter and transitional housing, My Sister’s Place currently provides housing for over 250 families. \n“Weve been lucky to have support from D.C. government for many years,” said Mercedes Lemp, who has been serving as the executive director since 2018. “I cant tell you about the first 39 years. But it is my understanding that theres always been a lot of community support and government support for the work we do.”\nLemp previously worked on domestic violence during her job at the Mayor’s Office of Latino Affairs under then-Mayor Adrian Fenty. She has also directed other nonprofits and realized that coming to My Sister’s Place would help fill a huge need in the area.\nMercedes Lemp, executive director of My Sister’s Place, reflects on the progress her organization has made. (Torrence Banks/ Capital News Service)\n“I think the D.C. area, its particularly hard because domestic violence victims, almost 99% of the time, theres financial abuse that goes with it,” Lemp said. “Youre (victims) are dealing with, in D.C., how expensive everything is, and you have no money.”\nForty percent of women and 25% of men in the District have experienced intimate partner physical violence, sexual violence, and/or stalking in their lifetimes, according to the D.C. Coalition Against Domestic Violence. Both of these numbers are higher than the national average.\nJust over 34% of women and 29% of men in Maryland experienced intimate partner physical violence, intimate partner rape and/or intimate partner stalking, according to the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence.  \nOf the 43% of single women who reported experiencing homelessness in the District 40% stated that domestic violence was the cause, the D.C. Coalition Against Domestic Violence has found.\n“Housing is in short supply, affordable housing rents are so high,” Lemp said. “Not only are you dealing with the physical trauma of domestic violence, but to be able to leave somebody is super hard because of all these other things.”\nMy Sister’s Place was started by the Women’s Legal Defense Fund (WLDF), now known as the National Partnership for Women and Families. \nDeborah Luxenberg, one of the founders of My Sister’s Place, suggested that WLDF look into ways to protect women in abusive relationships. \nAt the time, Luxenberg had opened her law firm on Mount Pleasant Street and had met with a woman from New Jersey. Luxenberg said the woman was assaulted by her husband, and she made the long commute to Washington because she had no friends or family to turn to.\n“It was from that experience and seeing there were no resources, for there was no place formally for her to go,” Luxenberg said, who served as the chair of WLDF’s Task Force on Abused Women. “There were no legal actions the courts would take specifically and I was really appalled at the situation.” \nDuring the early years of the task force members ran a 24-hour crisis hotline, held public education speaking events and provided training programs for judges and first responders. \nAfter three years of hard work, the task force opened its domestic violence shelter in 1979. \n“The shelter relied on huge numbers of volunteers, and I dont mean people who would come and fold towels,” said Valle Jones, one of the shelter’s founders. “I mean people slept overnight in the shelter to be available if anyone needed anything, or in particular to answer the 24-hour hotline.” \nWLDF became a nonprofit and expanded the shelter from 15 to 22 beds in 1981. Two years later, My Sister’s Place became the official name of the nonprofit, operating separately from WLDF. \nWLDF was more focused on domestic violence from a paralegal perspective, Jones said. As a result, the defense fund was better suited to help women dealing with legal challenges created by the absence of no-fault divorce when the shelter first opened. \n“Women living in domestic violence situations need more than just legal help,” Jones said. “And that was the direction that we wanted to move in.”  \nInitially, some members of WLDF did not believe that domestic violence was an issue that the group should focus on, Luxenberg said. After she spoke at an ACLU event in Philadelphia to an audience of about 300 regarding a different domestic violence case, Luxenberg said other WLDF members were convinced.\n“One of the Womens Legal Defense Fund officers was at that program that I spoke at said, ‘I think its a problem. There were several 100 people there to hear Debbie,’” Luxenberg said.\nWhile the District government has been supportive, Lemp said that one of the biggest challenges for the shelter is funding to help support residents. During COVID, she said, more federal funds were available, but now that money is drying up.\nIn addition, Lemp also wonders if the local government can do more to entice wealthy businesses to be more involved with affordable housing.\n“Making it more of everybodys business, like, if you buy a building, you also commit a certain amount to affordable housing,” Lemp said. \nNow a retired lawyer, Luxenberg said that the city’s response to domestic violence has improved immensely from when she served on the task force. Protective orders for domestic violence did not exist until 1993, making it more difficult for victims to receive court protection from their abusers. \nThe D.C. Superior Court established a Domestic Violence Unit in 1996 to specifically handle those cases. It was renamed the Domestic Violence Division in 2018 to clarify its work and differentiate it from other court divisions.\nThe D.C. Council unanimously voted in November to terminate a law that required couples to live separately for six months before filing for divorce, potentially untethering domestic violence victims from their abusers. \n“It’s like night and day,” Luxenberg said. “The differences are so extreme.”"

    "title": "Pressing for shield law, former CBS reporter Herridge calls seizure of files &#8216;journalistic rape’",
    "content": "WASHINGTON – Pushing for a federal shield law for reporters, veteran investigative journalist Catherine Herridge opened up Thursday during a House hearing about the seizure of her reporting files after her recent termination from CBS.\nSpeaking publicly for the first time about being let go by the network, Herridge equated the seizure of her files as “journalistic rape.”\n“When the network of Walter Cronkite seizes your reporting files, including confidential source information, that is an attack on investigative journalism,” Herridge told the House Judiciary Committee’s Constitution and limited government subcommittee.\nShe and three other witnesses supported the passage of a shield law called the PRESS Act, citing its importance for journalists and their sources.\n“Testimonial protections for journalists ensure the flow of information from source to journalist, allowing reporters to honor those assurances,” said Nadine Farid Johnson, policy director at the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University. “Such protections are essential to core First Amendment values.”\nSAG-AFTRA’s News  Broadcast Department Chief Broadcast Officer Mary Cavallaro warned that any form of government control over journalists “could chill the instinct of potential sources to come forward and tell their stories to journalists, depriving the American people of critical information and the ability to hold those in power publicly accountable.”\n“In decades of reporting nationally at CNN, CBS, PBS and for the last nine years on my TV show, ‘Full Measure,’ countless news stories that I broke or facets of them could not have been reported without sources whose identities needed to be protected,” television journalist Sharyl Attkisson testified.\nIn January, the House unanimously passed the Protect Reporters from Exploitative State Spying Act, known as the PRESS Act.\n“No longer will reporters have to worry that under a future repressive administration federal law enforcement agencies might secretly subpoena their emails and phone records even though journalists depend on confidentiality to keep the American public informed,” Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Maryland, said in a statement. Raskin introduced the bill with Rep. Kevin Kiley, R-California.\nThe Senate so far has not taken up the bill, but Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-New York, has signaled he hopes to bring it to the floor for a vote.\n“Yes, I am hopeful (that it will pass this year,)” Schumer told the New York Post.\nThe bill aims to protect “from disclosure any information identifying a source, as well as any records, contents of a communication, documents or information obtained or created by journalists in the course of their work.”\n“There is no more important hearing than this… this is of critical importance. And you know what, this is why we gotta pass the PRESS shield act,” said Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan, R-Ohio.\nAlthough Democratic committee members expressed concerns over the motivation for the hearing, members of both parties claimed to be in agreement about the need for the law.\n“There’s actually a lot that we agree on, and press freedoms and the PRESS Act is something that we were able to all come together on, and that’s where our attention should be,” said Rep. Becca Balint, D-Vermont.\nSome committee members, including the panel’s ranking Democrat, New York Rep. Jerrold Nadler, said they saw Herridge’s termination and CBS’s subsequent actions as more of a employment dispute, expressing reservations about congressional involvement between reporters and their news organizations.\nHerridge was terminated alongside 19 other CBS news staffers in February during a larger layoff of 800 employees at Paramount Global, CBS’s parent company.\nThe reporter’s termination came shortly after Special Counsel Robert Hur’s investigative report into President Joe Biden’s handling of classified information, released in early February.\nHerridge reported on Hunter Biden’s laptop controversy.\n“I think the imperative is to get the PRESS Act through the Senate and on the president’s desk,” Herridge said. “Its gonna close a gap in the federal courts, it’s gonna bring consistency between the state shield and the federal shield laws and I just think a lot of good will follow from that.”"

    "title": "Maryland congressional delegation confident of bipartisan backing for Key Bridge funds",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  The Maryland congressional delegation on Tuesday predicted bipartisan support for federal funding to rebuild the Francis Scott Key Bridge.\n“Tragedy knows no partisanship,” Rep. Andy Harris, Maryland’s lone Republican in Congress and a member of the House Freedom Caucus, said during a press conference following a Capitol Hill meeting involving the entire Maryland congressional delegation, Gov. Wes Moore, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and other officials. “I’m committed to make sure that we navigate this through a bipartisan process.”\nSome members of the House Freedom Caucus have been skeptical of an entirely federally-funded bridge reconstruction and have offered tough conditions for congressional approval, as reported by Politico.\nSen. Ben Cardin, D-Maryland, announced that he soon will be introducing legislation with Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Maryland, to clarify that the funds for the replacement of the Key Bridge will come entirely from the federal government.\nPresident Joe Biden committed the federal government to pay for the entire cost of rebuilding the bridge on the day of the collapse.\n“I believe youll find that theres going to be bipartisan support to do everything we need to to carry out President Biden’s commitment,” Cardin said.\nThe Biden administration approved an initial $60 million of quick-release emergency relief funds to the Maryland Department of Transportation on March 28. Those funds are being used for immediate wreckage removal and to prepare for the building of a replacement bridge, according to Buttigieg.\nThe emergency relief funds can cover 90% of a new bridge, according to Van Hollen. The senators’ legislation will allow the funds to cover the remaining 10% and detail how funds from any settlements will be used.\nA 100% federal cost provision has been used for previous bridge collapses, including the 2007 failure of the I-35W span in Minneapolis, according to the White House.\nAny funds received through lawsuits and liability settlements from third parties will go to relieve taxpayers, Cardin said. The senator and Buttigieg emphasized that the federal government cannot wait for insurance matters to be settled before sending relief funds.\n“We are not going to wait for these to play out to get the dollars where they need to be,” Buttigieg said.\nThe Key Bridge collapsed into the Patapsco River on March 26 after a container ship leaving Baltimore Harbor lost power and crashed into support beams, killing six members of a construction crew.\nThere are no cost estimates at this time for the replacement bridge, Cardin confirmed. The Key Bridge, opened in 1977, originally cost $110 million, according to the Maryland Transportation Authority.\nThe bridge collapse temporarily closed the Port of Baltimore, which directly employs over 8,000 workers and has an annual economic impact of $70 billion, according to the governor’s office.\n“A part of our soul fell into the Patapsco River,” Moore said at the news conference.\nMoore on Friday issued an executive order allocating $60 million in state funds to workers and businesses impacted by the bridge collapse. The funds will go towards relief programs and business loans.\nThe governor created the Maryland Tough Baltimore Strong Alliance, a group of 80 businesses and organizations that have agreed to support Baltimore and the state.\nMoore on Tuesday signed the Maryland Port Act, giving funds to port businesses and workers impacted and setting up a scholarship fund for the children of the six victims of the collapse.\nTwo alternative shipping channels have opened since the collapse and a third channel is expected to open this month that will handle a majority of port traffic, Cardin said.\nVan Hollen said it is now up to Congress to execute the promise of the executive branch and to ensure that there are enough emergency relief funds remaining for other infrastructure projects and disaster aid around the country."

The New Jersey woman authored the Equal Rights Amendment after participating in both the English and American womens suffrage movements. (Katharine Wilson/Capital News Service)\nOrigins of the ERA\nIn the 1920’s, fresh off the success of the 19th Amendment that gave women the right to vote, National Women’s Party members began to look at how to stop other methods of sex-based discrimination in the United States.\nAlice Paul, a member of the party, wrote the original Equal Rights Amendment in 1923. For nearly half a century, a version of the amendment was introduced in every session of Congress.\n“Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any state on account of sex,” the current version of the amendment, rewritten in 1943, states.\nCongress passed the Equal Rights Amendment and sent it to the states for ratification in 1972, with a seven-year ratification deadline. Activists and Paul herself later cited that deadline as the reason for the amendment’s travails, arguing that the deadline would encourage states to delay their ratification.\n“(Opponents) thought the only way they could defeat it now was not by an outright vote against but by making difficulties in ratification,” Paul said in an oral history with Amelia Fry, an historian at the University of California, Berkeley.\nPaul continued to advocate for the ERA until a stroke three years before her 1977 death, according to The New York Times.\nThere have been opponents of the amendment since its inception, one of its most famous being the late anti-feminist attorney Phyllis Schlafly, who said the amendment would take away policies that benefit women, would institute a draft for women, enshrine same-sex marriage rights and protect the right to abortion in the Constitution.\nSince the expiration of the 1982 deadline, three states  Nevada, Illinois and Virginia  have ratified the ERA. Virginia, the last state needed, ratified the amendment in 2020.\n!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r=0;r\n\nRecent push in Congress\nWith the threshold now met, politicians and advocates are rallying around the amendment once again - hoping to finally add the ERA to the Constitution.\nMultiple members of Congress introduced legislation to move the amendment forward in 2023, for the 100th anniversary of the amendment’s first introduction.\nCurrent legislation follows two strategies: removing the 1982 deadline and then directing the archivist of the United States to add the amendment to the Constitution.\nRep. Ayanna Pressley, D–Massachusetts, said the House Equal Rights Amendment Caucus is leveraging every tool available to pass the legislation. Pressley founded the caucus in 2023 with Rep. Cory Bush, D-Missouri.\n“​​The ratification threshold has been met,” Pressley said during a March 18 press conference. “The women of this country have done their job, states have done their job and now Congress must do its (job).”\nBush and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D–New York, both introduced resolutions that would recognize the ERA as ratified and enforceable. Both bills are sitting in each chamber’s judiciary committees.\nSen. Ben Cardin, D–Maryland, also introduced now-failed legislation to remove the deadline in 2023 in the Senate. In 2012, he argued against the deadline because such a restriction isn’t included in the Constitution and another amendment, the 27th Amendment, took over two centuries to ratify.\n“The women of this country are exhausted and it’s been 101 years too long,” Pressley said.\nWASHINGTON - Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D–Connecticut, speaks at a March 12 press conference outside of the United States Capitol about the Paycheck Fairness Act. (Katharine Wilson/Capital News Service)\nSome states take initiative\nAs activists wait on updates to the constitutional amendment, state-level Equal Rights Amendments have been passed.\nAs of 2022, 22 states have state-level Equal Rights Amendments and 28 states have forms of gender equality provisions in their constitutions, according to the Brennan Center for Justice.\nMolly Gonzales, the advocacy manager at the Alice Paul Institute, said the state amendments give advocates a window into what the Equal Rights Amendment could do nationwide.\nFor example, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court used the state’s ERA in January to argue that abortion restrictions can be challenged as sex discrimination.\n“We're kind of just starting to see the untapped potential of what that means,” Gonzales said about the state amendments.\nOutside of Equal Rights Amendments, women’s rights advocates are pushing for legislation that would make specific forms of sex-based discrimination more strictly prohibited.\nOne such measure is the Paycheck Fairness Act – aimed at bringing more transparency and strengthening penalties regarding sex-based pay gaps – introduced by Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D–Connecticut.\n“Our Paycheck Fairness Act would go a long way in terms of dealing with an Equal Rights Amendment,” DeLauro said in a March 12 press conference. “That would give strength to women's economic security.”\nWhy the ERA\nNearly 80% of Americans at least somewhat favor adding the Equal Rights Amendment to the Constitution, according to a 2020 Pew Research survey.\nIf there was an Equal Rights Amendment, Alice Paul Institute Executive Director Rachael Glashan Rupisan said, policies like recent abortion bans wouldn’t have happened.\n“We just saw specific acts and bills that have been in place in the law of land for decades taken away very easily,” Rupisan said in an interview with Capital News Service. “That's the difference: It's a lot harder to take away a constitutional amendment.”\nSince the ERA passed Congress in 1972, the gender pay gap has gradually decreased, but remains. In 1972, according to a report by the Congressional Research Service, women on average made almost 58% of men’s annual earnings. In 2022, women made 84% of men’s annual earnings.\nAlso important, Gonzales said, is that the ERA would explicitly place sex-based discrimination protections for women into the Constitution.\nERA advocates point out that the only place where women are mentioned in the Constitution is in the 19th Amendment.\n“So women can vote but they can't really have anything else,” Gonzalez said. “The ERA is such  an important issue, so many different generations and cross sections of people can really get behind it because we all have something to gain from it.” \nWASHINGTON - Believed to be the nation's first feminist library, a converted carriage house inside the Belmont-Paul Women’s Equality National Monument, the room is currently used by the National Park Service for special events. (Katharine Wilson/Capital News Service)\nThe Belmont-Paul House\nThe National Women's Party became an educational nonprofit in 1997 and fully disbanded in 2020, after four years of sharing the house with the National Park Service.\nIn the Belmont-Paul House, National Park Service Ranger Susan Philpott and her co-workers share the legacy of Paul and other women’s rights activists with visitors from around the world.\nSitting inside the nation’s first feminist library, a converted carriage house inside the historic building, Philpott reflected on her time at the house.\nOne item in the house that resonates with Philpott every time she sees it is a chair formerly owned by Elizabeth Cady Stanton, a leader of the women’s rights movement in the mid- and late 19th century. The chair is extra long and oddly shaped to accommodate the big skirts worn by women at the time.\nPhilpott takes inspiration from this chair because at a time when even furniture was gendered, Stanton and the many women who worked inside this house had the audacity to imagine that women could be treated equally.\n“I want people to know how hard change is,” Philpott said. “Sometimes the people who start the work don't get to see it to the end.”"

    "title": "Raskin speech at the University of Maryland disrupted by protest over Gaza",
    "content": "COLLEGE PARK, Md. – Maryland Rep. Jamie Raskin’s planned lecture on democracy Thursday at the University of Maryland instead turned into a lively discussion on the Israel-Hamas conflict in Gaza.\nRaskin was invited to give the Irving and Renee Milchberg Endowed Lecture and his intended subject was “Democracy, Autocracy and the Threat to Reason in the 21st Century.”\n“Progress in history requires not just reasoning, which is certainly necessary, but it’s not sufficient, because it also requires the addition of the pro-social emotions, as the psychologists call it, of solidarity, empathy, love and the political virtues of justice and equality and freedom,” Raskin said at the start of his speech.\nHis remarks were interrupted just a few minutes later by pro-Palestinian protesters shouting that Raskin is “complicit in genocide.” In response, Raskin said that he wished the protesters had engaged in a conversation with him, rather than “heckling.”\n\n\nCOLLEGE PARK, Md.  People protesting Israels military action in Gaza interrupt a speech at the University of Maryland Thursday by Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Maryland. (Yesenia Montenegro/Capital News Service)\nRaskin emphasized that he has taken a strong position on returning the hostages held by Hamas, has advocated a military ceasefire, and has championed a two-state solution. As he attempted to continue his lecture, protesters continued interrupting and shouting. Various protesters questioned Raskin’s actions since the Hamas-led attack on Israel on Oct. 7.\n“We need a new peace movement too, if you are the representatives of it,” Raskin said. “Because you’re not engaging in real dialogue with people and you’re not convincing anybody.”\nProtesters supporting Israel and those backing Palestine from both sides continued heckling and arguing with each other, making it impossible for Raskin to continue. He then abandoned the speech and said he was open to taking questions from the audience, leading to more discourse among protesters.\n“It’s very tough to solve problems in the Middle East here at the University of Maryland in the physics department,” Raskin said.\nDarryll Pines, the president of the university, later stepped in and terminated the lecture early.\n“He came here to speak about where our democracy is going in our country,” Pines told Capital News Service. “What you saw play out actually was democracy and free speech and academic freedom. From our perspective as a university, there are the difficult conversations that we should be having.”\nPines added that he wished, however, that the protesters had been more civil. He also praised Raskin’s patience and empathy when responding to the protesters’ comments and questions.\n“I wanted to make a plea for constitutional patriotism in defense of democracy and freedom around the world,” Raskin told CNS about his original speech. “Their sentiments were perfectly consistent with a lot of what I had to say.”\n“I’m not really opposed to heckling,” the congressman added. “But it seems like heckling today is all about drowning out the speaker, and that’s totally antithetical to the spirit of free expression.”\nHoward Milchberg, University of Maryland professor of physics and electrical and computer engineering, along with his wife Rena Milchberg and their three children, started the lecture in 2019. It celebrates the memory of Howard Milchberg’s late parents, who survived the Holocaust.\n“It didn’t go as planned, but it maybe turned out better than normal,” Howard Milchberg told CNS. “It was an actual exercise of democracy rather than a story about democracy.”"

    "title": "Biden administration ready to release money for Baltimore bridge accident",
    "content": "WASHINGTON – The Biden administration is prepared to provide federal funding to cover costs following the collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said Wednesday in a White House press briefing.\n“We are committed to delivering every federal resource needed to help Maryland get back to normal and we’re going to work with them every step of the way to rebuild this bridge,” Buttigieg said.\nWhile there is no estimate on the cost of rebuilding yet, there are provisions in place that allow funds to be released while the estimate is being determined. The Maryland Department of Transportation has released an emergency relief funding request, which will be processed immediately to start the funding process, Buttigieg said.\nThe infrastructure law authorized funding of the emergency relief account, which will most likely be used in this situation. According to Buttigieg, about $950 million is available. However, this money is used for other projects as well, so it is likely that Congress will be asked to authorize additional funding.\n“That shouldn’t be a barrier to the immediate next few days beginning to get the ball rolling,” he said.\nPresident Joe Biden met earlier in the Oval Office with Buttigieg and U.S. Coast Guard Vice Admiral Peter Gautier. The president also spoke by phone with Maryland Gov. Wes Moore and Lt. Gen. Scott Spellmon, chief of engineers and commander of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.\n“The people of Baltimore can count on us to stick with them at every step of the way until the port is reopened and Francis Scott Key Bridge is rebuilt,” Biden said in a post on X. “We’re not leaving until it’s done.”\nButtigieg said officials did not have an estimate yet of costs to replace the bridge. He also declined to estimate how long it will take to reopen the Port of Baltimore.\nAny private party found accountable for the accident will be held responsible, Buttigieg said. However, Biden’s goal is not to have that process interfere with Maryland getting the financial help it needs, he said.\nButtigieg said it was “possible if not likely” the administration will ask Congress for additional money to refill the emergency relief account.\nHe said he hopes that some Republicans will work with Biden and Democrats to provide that funding. He also reminded members of Congress on the fence about supporting federal funding to remember that “today this is happening in Baltimore, tomorrow it could be your district.”\n“Infrastructure is, or at least ought to be, a bipartisan priority,” the secretary said. “I know that partisanship has gotten in the way of some important functions and expenditures, but I would also note that the infrastructure package that was passed is known as the bipartisan infrastructure law for a reason.”\n“I think in a situation like this where you have a national emergency where its gonna attract a lot of attention, I think its gonna get through rather quickly,” John Dedie, a political science professor at the Community College of Baltimore County told Capital News Service. “There are gonna be some people that may grumble in the House a little bit, but I think that under the circumstances people are gonna realize economically something has to be done to build this thing.”\nButtigieg said the Department of Transportation will focus on reopening the port, dealing with supply chain implications until the port reopens, rebuilding the bridge and dealing with surface transportation implications until the bridge can be rebuilt.\n“The products that are now stuck behind the blocked channel are one piece of it, and that affects global markets everywhere,” Maryland Sen. Sarah Elfreth, a Democrat who currently serves on the state’s Budget and Taxation Committee, told CNS. “Not to mention what cant come into the port for the time it takes to clear the channel.”\nAbout 8,000 jobs are directly affected and between $100 million-$200 million worth of cargo moves in and out of the port every day, according to Buttigieg.\n“Rebuilding will not be quick, or easy or cheap, but we will get it done,” he said.\nThe accident investigation is led by the National Transportation Safety Board. The Coast Guard will also be providing investigators with its Marine Board of Investigation, which is one of the highest levels of investigation within the Coast Guard, Gautier said during the press conference.\nThe greatest immediate challenge, the vice admiral said, is going to be the removal of the bridge trusses now draped across the bow of the cargo ship. The bow of the vessel Dali currently is sitting on the bottom of the Patapsco River but there are no signs that the hull is leaking.\n“What we do know is a bridge like this one, completed in the 1970s, was simply not made to withstand a direct impact on a critical support pier, from a vessel that weighs about 200 million pounds,” Buttigieg said.\nAlthough there is no timeline yet, Buttigieg expects that the clearing of the channel will happen on a much quicker timeline than the reconstruction of the bridge. The Army Corps of Engineers is beginning the underwater surveys to understand the possible challenges the debris presents, Gautier said.\nThe State of Maryland is simultaneously conducting body recovery operations in and around the same area as the debris assessment, Gautier said. Six highway workers who were on the bridge at the time of the accident are missing and presumed dead.\nBiden plans to visit Baltimore as soon as possible, White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said. The Biden administration will work with local officials to ensure that a presidential visit would not disrupt the efforts at the scene.\nCapital News Service Washington Bureau reporter Torrence Banks contributed to this report.\n\nMore coverage:\n• After Bridge falls, Baltimore mourns a city symbol\n• Key Bridge’s collapse adds to list of U.S. bridge disasters\n• The history of Baltimore’s Francis Scott Key Bridge\n• Distress call precedes disaster at Baltimore bridge\n• Baltimores Key Bridge collapses after ship collision\n• Vessel traffic through the Port of Baltimore has been suspended indefinitely"

    "title": "EPA announces historic funding for Chesapeake Bay restoration programs",
    "content": "ARLINGTON, Va. — The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency announced Wednesday that $206 million in funding will be allocated towards projects aimed at continuing the restoration of the Chesapeake Bay.\nThe historic levels of funding reflect the Biden administration’s increased investments in environmental programs and infrastructure projects.\n“For a long time, the EPA’s budget has been so small, roughly about $10 billion a year,” EPA Assistant Deputy Administrator Mark Rupp said during a ceremony at the recently-built Lubber Run Community Center here. “Between the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the Inflation Reduction Act, there’s now over $100 billion flowing through our agency, and it really has been a game changer.”\nWith $96 million of the funds coming from President Joe Biden’s so-called “Investing in America” agenda alone, the announcement marked the largest single contribution to the Chesapeake Bay Program in its 41-year history.\nMaryland is expected to receive over $14 million from the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation’s share of the funds, which in turn makes up 40 individual grant projects.\nGrant recipients include the Baltimore Tree Trust, which plans to educate city residents about planting trees in their communities.\nThe Severn River Association will be another recipient. The organization intends to increase and improve stormwater treatment practices on the Severn River, which flows into the Chesapeake Bay in Annapolis.\n“Agendas matter, elected officials matter, vision matters,” Rep. Gerry Connolly, D-Virginia, said. “For the sake of the country, thank God we have the 117th Congress and Joe Biden to sign those bills into law.”\nAttending the ceremony were not only federal officials and members of Congress but also legislators from state and local governments around the Chesapeake Bay.\nLibby Garvey, chair of the Arlington County Board, said funds are going to be used in her community on a small tributary called Grandma’s Creek.\n“(The Grandma’s Creek project) is a great example of community involvement and advocacy for a beloved neighborhood stream,” Garvey said. “This project is going to propose the installation of rain gardens to better manage stormwater and increase the protection of the creek.”\nIn addition to rain gardens, the Arlington community will also have the opportunity to participate in organized tree plantings and pop-up educational events centered around nature, Garvey said. The funds for these projects will be derived from the Small Watershed Grants Program, one of three grant programs administered by the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation, which is to receive $193 million of the $206 million.\nThe NFWF already has announced it will be giving $1 million to farmers in Maryland, Virginia and West Virginia, with the intention of implementing high-priority conservation practices that improve water quality.\n“There are 40,000 farms in Pennsylvania, and many of them contribute nutrients and sediment to the bay,” Rep. Don Beyer, D-Virginia, said. “So anything we can do to get Pennsylvania on board with Maryland, Virginia and Delaware will be incredibly important.”\nThe Chesapeake Bay Trust, another non-profit grant-making organization, will receive the remaining $13 million from the EPA. The trust will use the money to assist local organizations involved with improving the bay.\nThis could include providing operational infrastructure like computers and other hardware, or funding employee training and professional development sessions.\n“We have to do better on agricultural runoff, and we have to do better on stormwater runoff. We do well on sewage treatment and on other point source pollution,” Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Virginia, told Capital News Service. “This $200 million is going to be heavily focused on grants that focus on non-point sources, and we should continue to see significant improvements.”"

    "title": "Supreme Court appears highly skeptical of potential limitations on abortion pill mifepristone",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  Most of the Supreme Court justices appeared skeptical Tuesday of oral arguments that they should rule in favor of restricting nationwide access to the abortion pill mifepristone.\nThe justices questioned whether the anti-abortion doctors with Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine, who filed the lawsuit against the Food and Drug Administration in November 2022, had been injured as a result of the FDA lifting restrictions on mifepristone usage in 2016 and again in 2021. \nThe mifepristone case is the most important abortion case before the court since the overturning of Roe v. Wade and the end to a constitutional right to an abortion with the Dobbs v. Jackson decision in June 2022. If a 5th Circuit Court of Appeals ruling is allowed to stand, access to the widely used drug for abortions would be curtailed and could impact the presidential election.\nJustices began questioning focused on who has standing to challenge the FDA’s actions in 2016 and 2021. \n“Is there anybody who could challenge in court the lawfulness of what the FDA did here?” Justice Samuel Alito asked Justice Department Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar, who argued on behalf of the FDA.\nThe 2016 changes “increased the gestational age limit from seven to ten weeks,” reduced the number of required in-person medical visits and allowed non-physician healthcare providers, such as nurse practitioners, to prescribe and distribute mifepristone. \nIn 2021, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the FDA utilized telehealth and eliminated the requirement for in-person distribution of the pill and later made the permanent change in 2023.  \n“The government has been routinely resisting standing because we think that that would essentially mean that any advocacy organization could say it opposes what the federal government is doing and so therefore has to devote resources to that opposition,” Prelogar said.  \nNumerous back-and-forth exchanges between the justices and Erin Hawley, wife of Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Missouri, who argued on behalf of the doctors, revealed the justices’ doubts about whether the FDA’s actions caused the injury Hawley claimed.\nJustice Ketanji Brown Jackson expressed concern trying to balance the claimed injury – the small number of adverse effects of the pill and likelihood of side effects – against the legal remedy, which would be nationwide limitations on the pill.\nThe justice noted that the “obvious common-sense” remedy for the doctors’ issue would have been to provide an exemption. \n“So I guess then what (the respondents are) asking for in this lawsuit is more than that,” Jackson said. “Theyre saying, because we object to having to be forced to participate in this procedure, were seeking an order preventing anyone from having access to these drugs at all. And I guess Im just trying to understand how they could possibly be entitled to that, given the injury that they have alleged.”\nSimilarly, Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Neil Gorsuch questioned why a nationwide ban on the pill is necessary. \n“Why cant the court specify that this relief runs to precisely the parties before the court, as opposed to looking to the agency in general and saying, ‘agency, you cant do this anywhere,’” Roberts asked Hawley.\nGorsuch said there were “zero universal injunctions that were issued during Franklin Delano Roosevelts 12 years in office” but around 60 in the last four years, emphasizing the extent of Hawley’s request.\nA nationwide ban, Prelogar argued, would harm the FDA, the pharmaceutical industry and women who need access to medical abortions. \n“What the (lower) court did to guard against that very remote risk is enter sweeping nationwide relief that restricts access to mifepristone for every single woman in this country and that causes profound harm,” Prelogar said.\nFirst approved in 2000, mifepristone, taken with another drug called misoprostol, operates by blocking progesterone, a hormone that is necessary for a pregnancy to continue, according to the FDA.\nThe FDA reported 32 deaths in patients associated with mifepristone as of December 2022.\nDuring the oral arguments, Justice Alito noted that the Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine said the studies used by the FDA to make the 2021 changes indicated that “mail order mifepristone suggests more frequent trips to the emergency room.”\nBut Alito read from an FDA report saying that although the literature suggests there may be more frequent emergency room care visits related to the use of mifepristone when dispensed by mail from the clinic, there are no apparent increases in other serious adverse events related to mifepristone use.”\nThe Supreme Court is expected to rule on the mifepristone case in June."

    "title": "Distress call precedes disaster at Baltimore bridge",
    "content": "BALTIMORE, Md – A container ship leaving the Port of Baltimore sounded a mayday call just before plowing into the Francis Scott Key Bridge in the early morning hours Tuesday, collapsing a fixture of the local landscape and prompting a rescue mission for an overnight road crew at work on the bridge at the time of the crash.\nThe last-minute warning likely saved countless lives by alerting officials to divert traffic away from the bridge, but rescue teams spent the entire day searching in vain for at least six individuals who were part of the construction crew. \nMaryland Gov. Wes Moore, who arrived in Baltimore Tuesday morning, said those aboard the ship alerted authorities they had a “power issue” shortly before the collision.\nGov. Wes Moore speaks at a press conference in Dundalk on March 26 after the Key Bridge collapsed earlier that morning. (Sapna Bansil/Capital News Service)\nAs a result of the ships warning, “local authorities were able to close the bridge to traffic before the bridge was struck, which undoubtedly saved lives,” President Joe Biden told reporters later that afternoon. \nSeveral road workers were fixing potholes on the bridge at the time of the collapse, according to Paul J. Wiedefeld, Maryland secretary of transportation. Two people were rescued at the site shortly after the collision, officials said.\nWhile the investigation is just beginning, authorities said all signs point to an accident. An FBI spokesperson said there is no evidence this was an act of terrorism. The bridge, which opened 47 years ago this week, was fully up to code, according to Moore.\n“To hear the words that the key bridge has collapsed, it’s shocking,” the governor told reporters. “The words that the key bridge is gone, it still shakes us …This is not just unprecedented, it’s heartbreaking.”\n\nPresident Joe Biden addressed reporters Tuesday afternoon, calling on Congress to support reconstruction of the bridge with federal funding. The bridge is crucial for travel through Baltimore and throughout the country’s northeast corridor, he said, while the Port of Baltimore functions as a critical part of the nation’s economy. \n“Were going to spend all the federal resources (the state) needs as we respond to this emergency. I mean, all federal resources,” said Biden. We’re going to reopen the port and rebuild the bridge as soon as humanly possible.”\nBaltimore City Fire Chief James Wallace said the ship struck a column of the bridge in the 1 a.m. hour, causing a major portion of it to snap. Entrances to the bridge were immediately shut down and traffic on this span of I-695 was redirected through the I-95 and I-895 tunnels. \nRescue efforts were then coordinated by several first responding agencies in the city of Baltimore and Harford County, along with the U.S. Coast Guard.\nOne patient from the incident was taken to the R Adams Cowley Shock Trauma Center at the University of Maryland Medical Center, a hospital spokesperson confirmed with Capital News Service. \nSynergy Marine Group, the company responsible for the ship’s management, said in a statement that all crew members and two pilots were accounted for and no injuries were reported. \nKey Bridge accident (Molly Szymanski / CNS)\nDundalk residents gathered along the highway leading to the bridge Tuesday afternoon. Many of them had woken up to the sound of rumbling in the early hours of the morning.\nHarvey Brice, 73, of Dundalk, said he heard “a tremendous noise.”\n“It kind of trembled the house a little bit,” said Brice.\nAmanda Peters, 44, of Dundalk, heard what she said “sounded like this long thunder, but it didnt make sense. It didnt sound like a normal sound from the port. It just was a constant like, its hard to describe it. It was so loud but it continued for so long.”\nCamille Sims, 23, of Glen Burnie, who works in Baltimore and frequently drives the bridge, said she was awake and felt her house shake after 1 a.m. \n“My house just started shaking a little bit. It wasnt crazy, like earthquake shaking, it was just like moving and I was confused,” she said. \nSeveral government officials issued statements in response to the incident. \n“Having worked in that area most of my life, I understand the bridges vital role for Baltimores Port and commuters,” State Sen. Johnny Ray Salling, whose district includes the bridge, said in a statement. “Losing this bridge will devastate the entire area, as well as the entire East Coast. We depend on the Port of Baltimore for transportation, travel, and commerce.”\nState House Republicans also released a joint statement, saying “while this horrendous incident will require a full investigation, right now our focus must be on the victims, their families, and making sure they get the care and services they need. We must also take a moment to acknowledge the bravery of our heroic first responders currently working on rescue efforts.”\nAn investigation into the incident is now in the hands of the National Transportation Safety Board, who will evaluate what the conditions of both the vessel and the bridge were leading up to the collision. \n\nMore coverage:\n• Biden administration ready to release money for Baltimore bridge accident\n• After bridge falls, Baltimore mourns a city symbol\n• Baltimores Key Bridge collapses after ship collision\n• Vessel traffic through the Port of Baltimore has been suspended indefinitely\n• Key Bridge’s collapse adds to list of U.S. bridge disasters\n• The history of Baltimore’s Francis Scott Key Bridge"

    "title": "Outside the Supreme Court, protesters decry potential new restrictions on abortion",
    "content": "WASHINGTON – Fifteen years ago, mifepristone saved Laura Clime-Coates’s dream of becoming a mother.\nThe Baltimore woman had a miscarriage and needed medication to expel the nonviable fetus, she said in an interview with Capital News Service. If Clime-Coates hadn’t had access to this medication to end her painful ordeal and save her uterus, she said, she might have not been able to have her daughter.\nOn Tuesday, Clime-Coates stood alongside that daughter, a third-grader, and hundreds of pro-abortion protesters outside of the Supreme Court. They called on the court to protect mifepristone, a commonly-used abortion drug, which is at the center of a legal battle between the federal Food and Federal Drug Administration and anti-abortion activists.\n“I was able to have her because my uterus was spared,”  Clime-Coates said, looking at her daughter. “We need to fight for our rights so that one day, if she needs to take it, it will still be available.”\nThe Supreme Court heard oral arguments Tuesday in a case that could change how mifepristone can be prescribed and threatens the FDA’s powers to regulate medications.\nOpponents of the drug say the pill is unsafe and are against the widespread use of the medication. The court’s ruling could impact the entire country, Planned Parenthood representatives said, including states where abortion rights are protected.\nThe FDA approved mifepristone in 2000 to be used within the first seven weeks of pregnancy. The approval later expanded in 2016 into the 10th week of pregnancy and in 2021 to allow the pill to be administered without a doctor, opening the door for telemedicine abortions.\nThe Supreme Court is expected to rule whether the regulations around mifepristone should be moved back to the original regulations, without telemedicine and limited to seven weeks.\nIf the Supreme Court were to rule against the FDA, rural Marylanders and other marginalized communities would bear a large share of the impact, Erin Bradley, vice president of public affairs for Planned Parenthood Maryland, told CNS outside the nation’s highest court.\nA majority of Maryland counties do not have an abortion clinic, Bradley said. The 2021 change opened the doors for mailed mifepristone, something Bradley said makes it easier for people who live far from clinics, work hourly jobs or struggle to find transportation to access the medication.\n“It allows people to exercise their rights when they want to, how they want to and most conveniently,” Bradley said.\nWASHINGTON  Laura Clime-Coates and her daughter protesting at the Supreme Court. (Katharine Wilson/Capital News Service)\nOn the plaza in front of the Supreme Court, the crowd of protestors on both sides chanted, gave speeches and sang.\nMontgomery County resident Darcy Nair was also standing with her young daughter. The pair were each dressed as suffragettes, holding signs above their heads that read “My Body My Choice.”\nNair started participating in protests in 2017, sensing that abortion and other issues she cared about hung in the balance. When the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, Nair said that it felt like a basic civil right was being stripped away.\n“I grew up being told that this was a place where I had personal freedom,” Nair said. “I just couldn’t believe it.”\nThis case is just the next battleground in the court’s fight to chip away abortion access, Nair said.\nOn the other side of the crowd, a group of anti-mifepristone protesters from Texas and the District of Columbia held up signs accusing the FDA of not protecting women’s health. Among these protestors was Texas resident Catherine Herring.\nHerring’s husband pleaded guilty to poisoning her drinks with abortion pills, she said. She called the drug dangerous and said that it landed her in the emergency room.\n“I just think its important for the FDA to support women, protect women,” Herring said. “Get the information out there that this is dangerous, and that there are side effects that occur when consuming chemical abortion.”\nLargo, Maryland, resident Leslie Page, who was standing near the anti-mifepristone protestors, said she doesn’t understand the activists, specifically young women, protesting against the pill.\n“I dont think any woman takes having an abortion lightly,” Page said. “They make a decision based on their circumstances, their life. How can somebody else tell them what to do?”"

    "title": "Fire officials push Congress to help attack growing wildfire threat",
    "content": "WASHINGTON – Wildfires are a growing threat to every state and fire officials are asking the federal government to step in to help.\nFire agencies across the country need more support and less governmental red tape to fight these conflagrations effectively, officials said at a Thursday hearing of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee.\nAs climate change increases the chances and spread of wildfires, the impacts of wildfires are being felt in nearly every state.\n“The effects of these fires arent only physical danger and property damage, they also bring a host of health risks in our communities in locations hundreds of miles from fire,” Sen. Gary Peters, D-Michigan, said.\nLast June, the East Coast was blanketed by thick, brown smoke from Canadian wildfires. Many major metro areas, including New York City and Washington, broke poor air quality records during the worst of the smoke.\nIn Maryland, last year was the worst in a decade for wildfires, according to data from the Maryland Forest Service.\nWhile fire season is typically thought of as late spring through fall, David Fogerson, Nevada’s chief of the Division of Emergency Management and Office of Homeland Security, said this is no longer the case.\n“We no longer have a fire season, but rather a fire year,” he told senators.\nThe Wildland Fire Mitigation and Management Commission, created in 2021 by the bipartisan infrastructure law, made 148 recommendations to improve how federal agencies respond to wildfires.\nThe recommendations centered on the need for agency collaboration, expanding firefighting staff and implementing proactive fire prevention techniques.\nMany problems surrounding how the United States handles fire emergencies come from the lack of collaboration among FEMA, the Forest Service and other federal agencies, the witnesses emphasized.\nWildfires need to be treated like hurricanes, Fogerson, a member of the commission, said in an interview with Capital News Service.\nAs a hurricane approaches, federal, state, local and tribal government agencies all work together to coordinate a response. The same is not the case for wildfires, he said.\nWhen a wildfire ignites, the responsibility falls on whatever agency owns the land. That agency is responsible for coordinating any collaboration to put out the fire, evacuate the area and set up recovery efforts.\nCoordinated action against wildfires only starts after a fire crosses property lines, Fogerson said.\n“Its just a mind shift,” he said. “Instead of relying upon the fire district that owns the land to be responsible for it, all the community treats it like a disaster and takes care of that.\nSome federal agencies have struggled to adapt to the changing patterns of fires and striking the balance between environmental protection and fire mitigation, other witnesses said.\nTo prevent major fires, the Forest Service and local fire department perform prescribed burns. While these planned fires are good to remove excessive combustible materials, they become difficult when it comes to smoke regulations, said Christopher Currie, director of homeland security and justice at the Government Accountability Office, the nonpartisan auditing arm of the Congress.\n“As you can imagine, EPA and the Forest Service have very different priorities as it pertains to wildfire smoke,” Currie said.\nThe current federal assistance system also struggles to help people who lost their homes due to fires, as the risk for fires in more populated areas has increased in recent years, Currie said.\nIt often takes longer for affected people to rebuild their homes after fires compared to other natural disasters, Currie said. Victims of fires have to manage multiple complicated federal programs that take too much time to navigate, he said.\nTo improve interagency collaboration and boost the number of firefighters, some officials said, there should be equal, better pay and benefits for all fire-fighting agencies.\nUtah recently increased pay for the state’s wildland firefighters, making the pay comparable to federal firefighters. Jamie Barnes, the director of Forestry, Fire and State Lands for the Utah Department of Natural Resources, said this compensation was important.\n“When a fire happens, it knows no boundary,” Barnes said. “We should all be making an amount that is similar so that theres no difference in what youre doing out there and receiving our resources.\nThere is a shortage of both wildland firefighters and local structural firefighters, according to U.S. Fire Administrator Lori Moore-Merrell.\nThe Biden administration increased pay for federal firefighters in 2021 to $15 per hour. On top of that were temporary pay increases through the bipartisan infrastructure law.\nCongress extended temporary pay increases for federal wildland firefighters in a supplemental funding bill this month. The Forest Service is asking Congress to develop a permanent pay solution for wildland firefighters, according to an agency statement in January.\nWhen federal firefighters are not sent quickly or fully staffed, local firefighters are left as the nation’s year-round fighting force, Fogerson said.\n“​​Weve got to get better about having a federal wildland firefighting force that’s adequately trained, resourced, and paid,  he said."

    "title": "Senators hear the case for cutting Americans&#8217; workweek to 32 hours",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  In 1955, Walter Reuther, head of what was then known as the United Automobile Workers (UAW), told a Senate hearing that coming technological advancements would make a four-day workweek possible.\nThat was the last Senate hearing on the subject for nearly 70 years. The Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee finally ended the draught Thursday as lawmakers debated legislation, sponsored by Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vermont, that would reduce the standard workweek to 32 hours without cutting employees’ pay.\n“Despite an explosion in technology and a massive increase in worker productivity, nothing has changed,”  Sanders said. “Think about that, huge transitions we have seen in the economy. But in terms of the workweek, nothing has changed.\nSanders said that the goal of his bill was to ensure that working-class citizens benefit from the revolutionary changes in the workplace over the past seven decades.\nIntroducing his measure Wednesday, Sanders said that U.S. workers had become over 400% more productive since the 1940s. Even so, people now are working longer hours at lower wages, he said.\nUAW President Shawn Fain said that automation now allows a single worker to do what used to require 12 workers. Companies’ obsession with ensuring productivity every second of the day has come at the cost of workers, he said.\n“When people reach the end of their lives they never say I wish Id make more money,” Fain told senators. “What they wish for is they wish they had more time. There was a time when this phenomenon was supposed to lead to workers getting our time back, getting some of their lives back.”\nForty percent of Americans work at least 50 hours a week, and 18% of today’s workforce works more than 60 hours a week, according to research cited in Sanders’ statement.\nA 2019 study published by the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health found that working more than 60 hours a week led to a decline in workers’ mental health compared to those who worked standard hours.\n“It causes an increase in cortisol levels, which lead to heart disease, cancers, strokes,” Fain said about working extended hours during the week. “But given all those facts as someone is lucky enough to get to retire, typically when they werent willing to work themselves to death their entire life, they face knee replacements, hip replacements, shoulder surgeries, and the rest of their lives, figuring out how theyre going to survive.”\nBut Liberty Vittert, a data science professor at the Olin Business School at Washington University in St. Louis, said that studies suggesting that working fewer hours leads to happiness are flawed. Vittert said that many of the studies showing an increase in happiness find the effects are short-term and that long-term studies show that happiness does not increase over time.\nIn addition, only companies that can cut out extra meetings and coffee breaks during the day participate in these studies, excluding more than 70% of the U.S. job economy, Vittert said.\n“If you want to see those same employees really stressed out, just see what happens when their employers lay them off to hire part-time workers instead, or have to close their doors because they cannot make enough revenue,” Vittert said.\nShe also pointed out that older workers who cannot complete the same amount of work in fewer hours are also at a disadvantage.\nSen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, the ranking Republican on the panel, emphasized that there is no law preventing companies from already enacting a 32-hour workweek and that federal intervention is not necessary.\n“Lets give flexibility to workers and employers  dont have government come in and intervene,” said Roger King, senior labor and employment counsel at the HR Policy Association."

    "title": "Steps from the Capitol, cafe owner offers tastes of Belarus and worries about home",
    "content": "WASHINGTON – Combine three parts whole milk and one part sour cream in a bowl. Then, place the mixture in a durable, medium-sized pot on low heat, and stir gently until curds form. After a few minutes, fetch a cheesecloth, strain the blend in a large dish, and let it rest.\nIn Southeastern Europe, cottage cheese is a feature of the region’s gastronomic profile, and for Belarusian cafe owner Aksana Tran, it’s a keepsake from her home under sanctions.\n“Natural color, natural taste… I give my guests this food, I can give my children this food,  (it’s) something you wouldn’t be afraid to feed (someone),” Tran, 51, said, looking to a spread of government buildings across from her shop’s patio. “I feed all my family.”\nThese days, Tran caters to a new family: her customers. Alongside a team of Belarusians and Ukrainians, she shares her culture from her restaurant Sweet Lemon Cafe, just a few minutes’ walk from the United States Capitol.\nEarly Years in the Minsk Region\nAbout an hour away from the capital of Belarus in the quaint town of Stolbtsy, Tran lived a simple life.\nHer mother was a midwife and her father was a railroad engineer. But after they married and moved cities, her mother quit a demanding post in reproductive care, turning to selling railroad tickets.\nWhile Tran’s parents worked, she and her two younger sisters tended to the family’s small patches of farmland intermittently between school — and for Tran, skiing practice. But it was a minimal reprieve.\nBelarus’ icy terrain made a prime arena for the winter sport. Tran skied throughout middle school and high school, and during the off-season, she worked at her parents summer house growing vegetables.\nThe countryside holds a populace of farmers and older citizens, and it’s customary for city dwellers to return to the pastures to cull produce with their families. Secondary property was not for rest, but a branch to maximize crops, according to Tran. She recalls her routine once she returned from the slopes: unpack and head to the steadings.\n“After I’d come back from training, (I’d) help my parents with work at the farm. It was quite (a) hard childhood, but it’s still your childhood and you remember it.”\nBeginnings Overseas\nYears passed and Tran’s family changed. Her youngest sister immigrated to the United States and landed in Massachusetts, leaving behind her family.\nWhile on a vacation from her job as an economist to visit her sister in the States, Tran, and her sister toured the nation’s capital to see the National Mall and explore the city’s museum scene.\nIt was a hot day, and they’d gone into a crowded Starbucks on Dupont Circle to refresh themselves. Surveying the cafe, Tran spotted a man at a partially vacant round table and asked if they could sit.\nShe and her sister joined him and conversation sparked over his curiosity about what language the two were speaking. Tran said Russian. He invited them to lunch but they declined – they had a flight to catch back to Massachusetts, although, they’d later recant after an abrupt schedule change.\n“We went to (the) hotel and the company called saying, ‘Your flight is canceled,’’ Tran said. “Because we took a picture with him before and we sent the picture to him, she (her sister) had his phone number. We texted him asking if he was still available because now we were available.”\nFrom that mild afternoon at a Japanese restaurant, Tran and the man talked for three years while she lived in Belarus and he lived in Washington. They married in July seven years ago and after a placeholder job as a felter in Alexandria, Virginia, Tran invested in her true passion.\nStumbling upon a closing eatery on Massachusetts Avenue not far from the United States Capitol, Tran bought the property. At a roundtable dinner with her husband and two daughters, Tran decided on the name Sweet Lemon Cafe, hired a crew of Southeastern European women, and formulated a menu integrating her homeland food with American comfort dishes.\nThe Russo-Ukrainian War\nParallel to a myriad of dog pictures gifted to Tran by her customers is a menu offering traditional East Slavic dishes like borscht, a ruby red meat-and-vegetable soup, and goulash, a spiced beef and noodle stew.\nOn another wall of the cafe hangs a Ukrainian flag, partly covered by a beverage machine.\nThe outbreak of the Russo-Ukrainian War on Feb. 24, 2022, left 3.7 million Ukrainians internally displaced, 14.6 million in need of humanitarian aid, and 6.5 million people as refugees as of last month, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.\nTran gave an interview to the radio network Voice of America, expressing her support for Ukraine. She said her public opposition to Russia bars her return to Belarus because she would be arrested.\nHer home country is under American sanctions following long-term Belarusian President Aleksandr Lukashenko’s falsification of the countrys 2020 election and suppression of political opposition. Her mother passed away last year and her father and younger sister are still in Stolbtsy.\nIn the back of the cafe is cook Viktoriia Protensko, 51, who fled Odessa, the third most populous city in Ukraine, to live with her daughter in Washington.\n“Every day, bombs and kamikaze drones fly in Odessa,” Protensko said.\nIt was a difficult decision to leave.\nProtensko found Sweet Lemon Cafe while searching for jobs after arriving in the nation’s capital. Her mother’s age made it difficult for her to uproot overseas, and the Ukrainian draft, which requires conscription for men between ages 27 and 60, drew her 46-year-old brother into the war.\nProtensko speaks to them every day and hopes that at the end of the war, Ukraine will remain an independent country.\nAnna Ramanaba is the first face at the cafe’s entrance. She takes and delivers orders, occasionally translating between English and Russian with Tran and Protensko.\nThe 22-year-old came to New York from Belarus two years ago to pursue an acting career. She discovered the cafe while transitioning between states, moving to Arlington, Virginia, to attend college.\nThe jump from the European to the American education system was chasmic, she said. Ramanaba studied criminal law in Belarus before dropping the profession and migrating to the States to follow an early dream, inspired by fictional teenage pop sensation Hannah Montana.\nShe reflects warmly on her home country, saying she misses the smell of frost when it’s about to snow and quality time with her younger sister, but discord drove her journey abroad.\nRamanaba, who’s biracial, endured discrimination in Belarus and looked to the diversity of the United States for career opportunities.\nShe said she knew more people in her home country who supported Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine than those who dissented. Disputes about the merits of the war inflamed relationships among Ramanaba’s professors, students, and her university’s administration. Some of the professors and students who objected to the war were expelled.\n“I was very much a backseat student. I had my own views… mostly my opinions and theirs were clashing,” Ramanaba said. “When you went to the point of speaking up, (it) was not going to change anything.”\nTran stood up from her iron lawn chair to greet a customer and walked up the stairs to the cafe. She said she hopes to expand her business to a larger location in the neighborhood, where she’ll introduce new items to her menu. Reflecting on her travels until now, she said her food is her art, and she looks to the future.\n“It’s a very difficult thing when you have this inspiration inside yourself, you like to do something, you like art, you like to create something, but you never had time for it,” Tran said. “…And so when I became free when I came here, I started all my time in this.”"

    "title": "Maryland lawmakers urge Congress to spend more on Chesapeake Bay restoration",
    "content": "WASHINGTON – Citing encouraging signs of improvement, five Maryland lawmakers expressed their support Wednesday for increased funding of the federally-backed Chesapeake Bay restoration program.\n“We’ve made progress,” Sen. Ben Cardin, D-Maryland, said at a luncheon hosted by the Choose Clean Water Coalition. “We have the least amount of dead zones that we’ve seen since the 1980s on the bay. We have underwater grasses that are coming back in the Chesapeake Bay. We have oyster crops that we never thought wed be able to see starting to bloom in the Chesapeake Bay. Were not at our historic levels, not even close. I understand that. But weve made progress.”\nThe coalition, which was started in 2009, hosted its 13th annual Chesapeake Bay Day on Wednesday with nearly 100 of its members and nine members of Congress in attendance. Made up of over 290 nonprofit organizations from the Chesapeake Bay region, the non-profit advocates maintaining or increasing spending on clean water programs.\n“I think the Chesapeake delegation in Congress is just so passionate about this work, and they understand the benefits to their districts and the people that live there,” Kristin Reilly, director of the coalition, told Capital News Service.\n“I think that’s also why there’s such wide bipartisan support for these programs because they can actually see the benefits in their communities,” Reilly added.\nThe Chesapeake Bay Program, which receives funding from the Environmental Protection Agency, was started in 1983, with its main efforts directed towards reducing pollution and restoring the bay’s ecosystem.\nThe program encompasses six states that surround the bay as well as the District of Columbia, and its funding needs were at the forefront of the coalition’s lobbying day. Over 70% of the program’s funds are spent on projects in the Chesapeake Bay watershed, including planting trees, reducing runoff from farmland and boosting the crab and oyster populations.\nThe coalition highlighted the recent introduction of the America’s Conservation Enhancement (ACE) Reauthorization Act of 2024, which authorizes funding for various programs, including $93 million in funding for the EPA Chesapeake Bay Program for the 2025 fiscal year and $100 million for 2026 and beyond.\n“This bill (the ACE Act) is going to get the bay on track,” Rep. Dutch Ruppersberger, D-Maryland, said. “Some of the things that these grants do, like sediment reduction, really make a difference in helping the Chesapeake Bay.\nThe coalition also is backing $15 million for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s Watershed Investments for Landscape Defense (WILD) program, which provides grants to local organizations in the Chesapeake region that focus on restoring or protecting wildlife habitats.\nThe coalition recognized Ruppersberger, Cardin and Rep. John Sarbanes, D-Maryland, as “Chesapeake Champions” for their contributions to the restoration efforts throughout their careers.\nRep. David Trone, D-Maryland, who is running for the U.S. Senate, said he plans to continue working to protect the bay if he wins the seat.\nPollutants need to be kept out of the bay and the efforts towards no-till farming have not been as successful in Pennsylvania and Virginia as in Maryland, Trone said. No-till farming is a technique used to grow crops without disturbing the soil.\n“The environment is top of the list,” Trone told CNS. “So the environment and the bay, thats the very very top of the list. If you dont get that right, nothing else matters.”\nAfter the luncheon, coalition members had scheduled 44 meetings with members of Congress, presenting letters from 169 organizations that endorsed the coalition’s appropriations requests.\n“We have to both maintain the momentum, but we also need to accelerate our efforts even further,” Sen. Van Hollen, D-Maryland, told CNS. “That means making sure that we protect and expand the resources that go to protect the bay from all the federal agencies.”"

    "title": "NTSB: Plane door incident probe hindered by lack of Boeing documents",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  The head of the federal agency investigating the door plug that blew off of a Boeing 737-MAX 9 in mid-flight in January said Wednesday investigators do not yet have key documents from the aircraft manufacturer.\nJennifer Homendy, chair of the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), told a Senate Commerce, Science and Technology Committee hearing that Boeing has not provided her agency with documentation that it has requested regarding the incident involving Alaska Airlines Flight 1282. Included in the requested records are the names of the 25 employees who were responsible for the doors at the company’s production facility in Renton, Washington.\n“Well, its beyond disappointing,” said Washington Sen. Maria Cantwell, a Democrat and chairwoman of the panel. “We have an entire economy that depends on people getting this right. And I thought that the CEOs have been cooperating for us.”\nWithout the list, Homendy said that the agency has used emails and text to piece together when the work on the door took place. But investigators haven’t been able to interview anyone on the team responsible for working on the doors.\n“Weve asked for the records with respect to what occurred,” Homendy said. “Weve asked for what shift it occurred on. And we think we know the days the work occurred on but thats only because our investigators were looking at pictures and emails to try to get to the bottom of that information.”\n“Well, I will say that is utterly unacceptable,” Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, said about Boeing’s lack of assistance. “And the parties who are being investigated by NTSB need to cooperate fully. And Congress expects them to cooperate because you have an obligation to the American public at the bottom of what happened.”\nHomendy said that the NTSB has been told that Boeing has a procedure for documenting when door plugs are opened, closed or removed. However, without the documentation to confirm that, Boeing opens itself to questions regarding its quality and safety management systems.\n“There are two options,” Homendy said. “Either they (the documents) exist, and we dont have them, or they do not exist, which raises several different questions.”\nBoeing issued a statement in response to the hearing, saying: “We have now provided the full list of individuals on the 737 door team, in response to a recent request. With respect to documentation, if the door plug removal was undocumented there would be no documentation to share. We will continue to cooperate fully and transparently with the NTSB’s investigation.”\nThe company said that it had “worked proactively and transparently to fully support the NTSB’s investigation.”\n“Our team works tirelessly with the NTSB team to respond comprehensively to all NTSB information requests and bring information to them that would be relevant to their investigation,” the Boeing statement said. “Early in the investigation, we provided the NTSB with names of Boeing employees, including door specialists, who we believed would have relevant information.”\nThe Alaska flight, with 171 passengers and six crewmembers aboard, departed from Portland, Oregon, on Jan. 5 bound for Ontario, California. At 14,000 feet, the left door plug blew out.\nThe plane, suddenly open to the air, depressurized, creating a horrific scene that left passengers terrified. The pilot was forced to return to Portland International Airport for an emergency landing.\nA preliminary NTSB report last month said investigators discovered that four key bolts securing the door plug were missing before the incident.\nSince the incident, several passengers aboard the plane have filed lawsuits against Alaska Airlines and Boeing over the incident. In February, three passengers filed a $1 billon suit against the companies."

    "title": "Reproductive rights advocates urge Congress to recognize women&#8217;s economic burdens",
    "content": "WASHINGTON – With ever-changing laws on reproductive rights across the country, advocates are urging Congress to recognize the economic burdens women face when trying to access reproductive healthcare, especially in states where it is restricted.\nAllie Phillips, a mother and activist from Tennessee, told the Senate Budget Committee Wednesday of her emotional ordeal, learning that she needed an abortion after finding out the fetus was not developing. Staying pregnant would have put her own life at risk. But due to Tennessee’s abortion ban, she had to travel to New York to have the procedure, which was complicated and expensive.\n“I would like to ask the committee to remember my story,” Phillips said. “And to remember that Im one of thousands, if not millions, of people in this country that need or needed abortion access.”\n“We cant be putting politics into health care decisions,” she said. “And also to remember these facts, that abortion access is essential health care, no matter how you want to look at it.”\nSen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-Rhode Island, and the budget panel’s chairman, agreed: “Reproductive rights, it turns out, are intrinsically tied to economic opportunity. Reproductive justice is economic justice. Restricting one restricts the other.”\nHowever, Sen. John Kennedy, R-Louisiana, pushed back, arguing that “there is no economic justice for the baby because the baby is dead.” Kennedy then went on to describe in graphic detail what the process of getting an abortion looks like.\nThe committee hearing came after an Alabama Supreme Court decision last month in February that limited access to IVF treatment in the state, ruling that a frozen embryo is considered a baby.\nWhile the ruling does not eliminate IVF treatment in the state, it allows fertility clinics to be sued under the state’s wrongful death law if embryos are lost or destroyed. This has led several fertility clinics in Alabama to pause treatment.\nAlabama lawmakers on Thursday advanced legislation that would provide lawsuit protections for the clinics.\nThe Alabama ruling came against the backdrop of the Supreme Court’s 2022 decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization that overturned Roe v. Wade, the ruling that protected the right to an abortion nationwide. Since then, 14 states have made abortion illegal and many states continue to change their abortion laws.\nWitnesses agreed that it is necessary to give women and mothers the support they need, whether they decide to have an abortion or go another route.\n“Right now, the Dobbs story is an inequality story, not a macro-level shock story,” Caitlin Myers, a professor of economics at Middlebury College, told senators.\nShe said the legalization of abortion in the 1970s reduced teen pregnancy, teen marriage and the maternal mortality of black women.\n“If abortion access were further restricted, if Congress were to enact a national ban, then we would begin to play the 1970s in reverse, watching the reduction in womens capacity to fully participate in our nations economy,” Myers warned.\nSen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, insisted that the Dobbs decision did not criminalize abortion and did not do anything to affect the legal status of abortion other than giving the decision to the states.\n“The Supreme Court and Dobbs simply undid Roe and said ‘This is a decision that most of the time… isn’t normally going to be federal action,’” Lee said.\nRestrictions on reproductive freedom impact not only patients but doctors as well, Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Maryland, pointed out. There are “real challenges doctors face when trying to navigate the legal areas,” he said.\n“…Doctors and their decisions to have to move to other states and how that leaves women in the workforce in states like Tennessee at greater risk,its because doctors dont want to end up being fined or worse for their actions,” Van Hollen said.\nDr. Leilah Zahedi-Spung, a certified OB-GYN and maternal-fetal medicine physician, told senators the Supreme Court’s action has upended her practice.\n“I did 11 years of training in order to become a doctor… and then a law went into effect that took my ability to care for my patients in the way that was necessary away from me, and from so many others,” she said.\nZahedi-Spung said that after Roe v. Wade was overturned, much of her time was spent talking to various lawyers, and she wasn’t able to care for her patients.\nThe White House on Thursday hosted a roundtable with nine advocacy groups focused on ensuring access to fertility services.\nWhite House officials reaffirmed the Biden-Harris administration’s commitment to fighting to protect access to reproductive health care, including IVF, in the wake of relentless attacks by Republican elected officials following the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, according to a statement released by the White House.\nPresident Joe Biden has called on the Congress to pass legislation that would restore abortion rights nationwide.\nThe organizations represented at the roundtable included the Alliance for Fertility Preservation, the American Cancer Society, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, Family Equality, the Leukemia  Lymphoma Society, the National Center for Lesbian Rights, RESOLVE: the National Infertility Association and the Sickle Cell Reproductive Health Education Directive."

    "title": "Maryland&#8217;s Ruppersberger reflects on over two decades in Congress ahead of retirement",
    "content": "WASHINGTON – Many people who retire from Congress are ready to leave the long days, partisan infighting, frustrating pace of legislation, endless fundraising and time away from family.\nBut Rep. Dutch Ruppersberger, D-Maryland, isn’t quite ready to say goodbye yet, despite announcing his retirement after 40 years in public office.\n“Im not happy and I dont want to leave, but I got five grandchildren,” Ruppersberger, who turned 78 in January, said in an interview with Capital News Service in his memento-filled office with a view of the United States Capitol.\nRuppersberger’s political career started in Baltimore, where he was elected to the Baltimore County Council in the 1980s. In 1994 and 1998 he was elected Baltimore County executive.\nHis time in Congress began in 2002 when he was elected to represent Maryland’s Second District.\nOriginally he wanted to run for governor, not Congress, Ruppersberger said. But he decided that if he could get on the House Intelligence Committee he would run for the House.\nRuppersbergers office is filled with mementos from his more than two decades in Congress and his service to Maryland. (Brennan Stewart/Capital News Service)\nThe avuncular Ruppersberger credits much of his political success to his teamwork and his bipartisanship. A good team is necessary to take care of constituents, he said.\n“I was very bipartisan,” Ruppersberger said. “And you have to be when you’re county executive, local government. You have to be bipartisan, you work on all sorts, from business to people who are on welfare. There’s so many issues.”\nRuppersberger’s district is made up of large parts of Baltimore and Carroll Counties and a part of Baltimore City. He is in his 11th term in the House.\n“You have to go out and see the people,” Ruppersberger said. “You cant sit in an office and think youre gonna get elected. You have to have people on your team who will go out every day and represent you in the community.\nRuppersberger was motivated to get involved in politics after a major car crash he was involved in when he was 28. He was left with 15 broken bones and was in bad shape. He credits the Shock Trauma Center at the University of Maryland for saving his life. Dr. R. Adams Cowley, who founded the trauma center, encouraged Ruppersberger to run for office.\nRuppersberger has supported trauma centers extensively throughout his career and serves as vice chairman of Shock Trauma’s Board of Visitors.\n“I know I had brain damage or I wouldnt be in politics,” Ruppersberger joked.\nDuring his time in Congress, Ruppersberger has worked on several successful projects.\nOne that stands out is the Hero Miles program, which donates airline tickets to members of the armed forces. Ruppersberger said he noticed that when troops overseas were flown back to the United States they were only taken to a few airports, then would have to pay for their connecting flights home. He fought for this to change and to have Hero Miles put in place in 2003.\nRuppersberger did end up serving on the House Intelligence Committee, where he spent 12 years. In 2011, he was named the ranking member of the committee. The post qualified him as a member of the so-called “gang of eight,” a group of House and Senate lawmakers privy to classified briefings on the country’s top-secret intelligence activities.\n“I like the action,” Ruppersberger said. “I like being able to make a difference, which you can in the gang of eight, and I like working with bipartisan people It was the first time that the House and the Senate, really the gang of eight, came together and worked for the country. And I really, really liked that.”\nWhile on the intelligence panel, Ruppersberger traveled around the world to countries including Iraq, Afghanistan, Yemen, Pakistan and China.\nAlong with the then-committee chairman, Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Alabama, he became the first dual recipient of the William Oliver Baker Award from the nonpartisan Intelligence and National Security Alliance for their bipartisanship.\n“We told people that whether youre Democrat and Republican, whether youre the majority or minority, were going to run this as a team,” Ruppersberger said. “And were not fooling around, were gonna get a lot done. And if you dont do that, were going to ask that you leave the committee.”\nSince 2015, Ruppersberger has served on the House Appropriations Committee, where he specializes in national security. The committee allocates billions of federal dollars every year and is powerful because it has the final say on spending. Ruppersberger said that the position has allowed him to allocate money for Maryland and his district while also working on national issues.\nRuppersberger refers to himself as an “action guy,” which is why he’s going to have a hard time retiring, he said.\nHe said he plans to continue working on projects and causes he is working on now even after he leaves office.\nWhat made the decision to retire even harder was the current state of Congress, which he said was enduring “some of the worst times” he’s ever seen.\n“I think Congress itself is not doing what they need to do,” he said. “You know youre always gonna have a majority, minority, and the majority is gonna get more than the minority. But right now, whats happening with the Republicans, basically they agree on something and then they disagree…and it’s just not right. Id like people to reach out to both sides of the aisle.”\nThree of Maryland’s eight House seats are open this election cycle. In addition to Ruppersberger, Democratic Rep. John Sarbanes, who represents Maryland’s Third District, also is retiring. And Democratic Rep. David Trone is leaving Maryland’s Sixth District seat to run for the Senate.\nRuppersberger said that the next generation of lawmakers must work together, which he will emphasize to the candidate who will take over his spot. He has already endorsed Baltimore County Executive Johnny Olszewski, who is running in a contested Second District Democratic primary to succeed Ruppersberger, and Trone in his bid for the Senate.\nRuppersberger believes there is a “very good possibility” that Democrats will gain the majority in the House in the November elections. The Republicans currently hold a thin 219-213 advantage in the House.\n“The Republicans couldnt even elect a speaker, it took them six people,” Ruppersberger said. “They keep changing their minds. You need strong leadership and somebody who can stand up to your own party. You got to lead.”\nDemocrats are doing a good job at talking about what could make a difference to help and support people, Ruppersberger said. A lot of people are hurting in this country, he added.\nPassing bills such as providing funding for Ukraine and Israel will hold the nation together and make it stronger, he said.\n“I have 10 more months here and I plan on doing what I’ve always been doing,” Ruppersberger said. “Doing the best I can…And I’m not happy about leaving, I’m sad.”\n“Life will take care of itself,” the congressman said. “I have a lot of experience and a lot of friends so, in the end, I’ll be fine. I just need some time not to be sad about leaving this. It’s been my life for a long time.”"

    "title": "Retirement crisis threatens current workers, experts tell Congress",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  The worsening retirement crisis impacting senior citizens will overtake current workers down the line if not fixed, experts say. \n“The data clearly shows most Americans will not have enough money for a financially secure retirement and they are worried about it,” Dan Doonan, executive director of the National Institute of Retirement Security, told the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee Wednesday. \nThirty-eight percent of middle-income and 71% of low-income households are at risk of not being able to maintain their same lifestyle after retirement, according to 2023 research from a Boston College study based on the National Retirement Risk Index. \nSen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vermont, and chairman of the panel, said that about 45% of senior citizens do not have any retirement savings. This leaves millions of senior citizens frightened about how they’ll be able to live out their post-work lives, he said.\n“One out of every four senior citizens in America is trying to live on an income of less than $15,000 a year,” Sanders said. “Think about that. While over half of our nations seniors are trying to survive on an income of less than $30,000 a year. Just put yourself in the place of that person.”\nSanders said that the United States now not only has one of the highest childhood poverty rates but also the highest senior poverty rate of any developed nation. \nNearly 23% of citizens above age 65 in the United States are living in poverty, according to data from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), a 62-year-old international public policy institution based in Paris. Other wealthy nations, like France and Denmark, have senior poverty rates just above 4%.\n\n“I would hope that we would agree that that is simply unacceptable,” Sanders said. “And thats got to change.”\nSara Schambers, a United Auto Workers member who currently works at the Ford Motor Co.’s Livonia Transmission Plant in Michigan, told senators that she doesn’t have a pension, health care, or retirement security. Schambers has worked with the company for 17 years and is a fourth-generation auto worker.\nGetting a job at Ford no longer ensures the American dream or stability that her mother and grandparents once had, she said.\n“Ford was the American dream. If I worked hard, Id be able to have a life after Ford Motor Company,” Schambers said. “But without a pension, without health care, we have people leaving these companies after 30 years with nothing more than a ‘have a nice day.’ And I hope the stock market doesnt crash.” \nOver time, many companies have phased out reliable pension plans due to costs, leaving their employees in a tough situation. While Schambers said she is proud of UAW’s recent successful strike, she said she believes that there’s still a lot to make up for the benefits workers have lost over the years.\n“I am proud of the accomplishments that weve made after 15 years of falling behind after the financial crisis,” Schambers said. “But we still fell short of what generations of auto workers had. We still fell short of what the American dream should be.” \nTeresa Ghilarducci, a professor of economics and policy analysis at the New School for Social Research in New York, said that looking at the average retirement wealth in the United States paints a misleading picture. \nShe noted that while people may think the average retirement wealth is high, the median retirement wealth for the bottom 90% has decreased.\n\n“If Elon Musk walked on the witness stand today, we would be the richest, on average, witnesses of all time in the health committee,” Ghilarducci said. “But the typical retirement wealth for us would not go up for the typical American approaching retirement.”\nDoonan acknowledged that the move away from pension plans and solely relying on 401k plans has helped create the retirement crisis. While a 401(k) allows employees to control their contributions, it does not guarantee a recurring check after retirement, he said. \nDoonan said that pensions would better benefit workers, employers and the economy.\n“Conventional wisdom suggests that 401(k)s cost less,” Doonan said. “But I think what I hear when that is said is it means putting less money into a less efficient system as costs rise and hoping for the best.”\nSen. Bob Casey, D-Pennsylvania, has introduced the 401Kids Savings Act, which would create savings accounts for children starting at birth. When a child turns 18, the funds could be used for future needs like getting a college degree and even retirement.\n“It’s a really good plan,” Ghilarducci said. “We should start with wealth and accumulate it.”"

    "title": "Senators condemn &#8220;mismanagement&#8221; at federal prisons for high suicide rates",
    "content": "WASHINGTON — More than 300 people died of suicides, homicides, and accidents in federal prisons between 2014 and 2021 — numbers that drew fire from a Senate panel Wednesday.\nThe deaths too often have been the result of mismanagement and operational failures, said Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Illinois, who presided over a hearing of the Senate Judiciary Committee.\nIt is evident that many of the issues the committee has highlighted over the years, including understaffing, overuse of restrictive housing and employee misconduct, will continue to have deadly consequences if they go unaddressed, Durbin said.\nThe hearing focused on a Department of Justice inspector general’s report on prisoner deaths in federal prisons released earlier this month.\nOut of the 344 nonmedical deaths between 2014 and 2021 detailed in the report, 187 were ruled as suicides, followed by 89 homicides, 56 accidents and 12 cases in which the manner of death was unknown.\n!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r=0;r\nMore than half of the prisoners who died by suicide were in solitary confinement or housed alone in a cell. According to the report, the \"risk of suicide is further compounded\" in restrictive housing, where inmates spend up to 23 hours a day in their cells.\n\"We know that the overuse of solitary confinement causes lasting, irreparable mental harm to incarcerated people,\" said Durbin on the Senate floor ahead of the hearing, as he announced his upcoming reintroduction of legislation aimed at limiting the use of solitary confinement in U.S. prisons.\nResearchers have linked solitary confinement to both physical and psychological health problems. Almost 10,900 federal prisoners are currently held in segregated units alone or in smaller cells with others. Forty-five prisoners have been in these units for over a year, according to data published by the bureau.\n\"Everyone who is in restrictive housing will suffer some form of mental or physical damage,\" Colette Peters, director of the Federal Bureau of Prisons, acknowledged at the hearing.\nBut Peters said that almost 40% of those who lived in isolation did so by their own choice because they were afraid of other prisoners.\nSen. Cory Booker, D-New Jersey, said the nation's suicide rate \"should cause concern for all Americans,\" but that incarcerated people die of suicide at a much higher rate and asked Peters how the bureau will curb these numbers.\nPeters responded that the bureau's data indicates that the suicide rate among its incarcerated population is lower than that of the general population in the United States.\nBureau spokesperson Randilee Giamussio told Capital News Service that the suicide rate in fiscal 2022 was 14.4 per 100,000 prisoners. Giamussio clarified that Peters referred to the suicide rate of American men in the general population, which was 23.1 per 100,000, according to provisional data for the same year from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nThe bureau suggested that this sample more accurately compares to the incarcerated people who die of suicide in federal prisons, since almost all of them are men. In fiscal 2023, 25 people incarcerated in federal prisons died of suicide, according to the bureau.\nPeters stressed that prison guards had the \"toughest beat\" in law enforcement.\n\"We need to pay them more,\" she said. According to a current job posting, the salary for a federal corrections officer starts at $48,809.\nOne guard who worked outside of Boston quit his job for a better offer: to work at a grocery store, Peters said. She added that the bureau has only filled about 82% of its authorized correctional officer positions.\nWASHINGTON - Michael Horowitz, the inspector general of the Department of Justice and Colette Peters, the director of the Federal Bureau of Prisons, testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday. (Mathew J. Schumer/Capital News Service)\nShe said that while the average training time for law enforcement officers typically exceeds 20 weeks, officers in the federal system only receive about six weeks of training.\nHowever, special training for those who work in restrictive housing and reforms to reduce the amount of time prisoners spend isolated was underway, Peters said.\nThe inspector general’s report found deficiencies in mental health assessments of federal prisoners.\nThe majority of those who died by suicide were misclassified as not needing any significant mental health care. That was just one of the failures that \"contributed to inmate suicides,\" the report said.\nSeven prisoners died by suicide in single-cell confinement while quarantining during the coronavirus pandemic. They were placed in isolated cells \"not because they were acting up, but because of COVID quarantine,\" Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz told the panel.\nHe drew attention to the fact that these deaths occurred despite the central bureau office ordering its facilities not to use single-cell confinement to quarantine prisoners.\nFive of these prisoners were not previously examined for mental health issues, Horowitz added.\nAdditionally, investigators encountered problems with federal prisons' documentation: records for 76 deaths were missing.\nThe Government Accountability Office found in a separate report that the bureau had not fully implemented 54 of the 87 recommendations from two prior studies on improving restrictive housing practices.\nHorowitz stressed that these issues are not new to the bureau.\n\"The problems we have identified over the past 20 years will not be solved overnight,\" he said, \"but they must be addressed with urgency.\""

    "title": "Lawmakers propose task force to probe long-term inequities facing Black women",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  The persistence of economic, educational and legal disparities in the lives of Black women and girls would be the target of a federal task force recently proposed by a group of House members.\n“Simply acknowledging our country’s history of targeted discrimination, harassment and violence against Black women and girls will not correct years of systemic racism and sexism,” Rep. Robin Kelly, D-Illinois, said in a statement after the legislation creating the task force was introduced earlier this month. \n“We must leverage the full weight of the federal government to seek justice for Black women and girls who deserve an equal opportunity for a full, happy, healthy life,” Kelly said.\nKelly is co-chair of the Caucus on Black Women and Girls, along with Reps. Yvette Clarke of New York and Bonnie Watson Coleman of New Jersey, who also sponsored the measure. Reps. Jennifer McClellan, D-Virginia, Valerie Foushee, D-North Carolina, and Brian Fitzpatrick, R-Pennsylvania, also have signed on to the bill, called the “Protect Black Women and Girls Act.”\nThe bill would establish a task force to examine several aspects of the lives of Black women and girls, including education, healthcare, economic development, housing and civil rights. The task force would look at the effectiveness of programs and policies at the state, federal and local levels and make recommendations for changes. \nKelly said that the bill would help governments be more proactive in ensuring that Black women receive equal opportunities.\nThe task force would be led by the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Justice. Both would then share information with the United States Commission on Civil Rights (USCCR).\nThe civil rights commission also would conduct a study and collect data about the social justice, economic and health effects of discrimination and inequities on Black women and girls. The bill was originally introduced in 2021 with 15 co-sponsors. However, Congress took no action on it.\nMaryland Del. Jheanelle Wilkins, a Democrat, said the legislation would allow the state’s government to look at the results from the research and craft more equitable policies.\n“We know that signs point to black women being disproportionately impacted by many things whether its maternal health  and in Maryland, Black women are four times as likely to die as a result of childbirth,” said Wilkins, who also serves as the chair of the state’s Legislative Black Caucus.\nIn 2021, the maternal mortality rate of non-Hispanic Black women was 69.9 births per 100,000 live births, according to the Centers for Disease Control. That was more than two times the rate for non-Hispanic white women. \n“We are the caregivers for our community, were the matriarchs of our home, but also of the Black community,” said Kelli Richardson Lawson, founder of the mental health nonprofit organization The SonRise Project, based in Bethesda, Maryland. “So weve always had to take care of everybody else before we take care of ourselves.” \nLawson said that passage of the legislation is critical because of the socioeconomic challenges that Black women have faced.\nThirty-nine percent of white women earn a bachelor’s or associate degree by the age of 29, compared to 21% of Black women, according to the American Association of University Women. \n“Based on what Ive seen, this bill would help mitigate some of the issues that we see involving Black women and girls in a variety of areas,” said Lawson, whose non-profit serves as a safe space for Black parents to discuss issues involving teen mental health. \nBlack girls also face disadvantages in education. A 2020-2021 school discipline report from the U.S. Department of Education’s Office of Civil Rights found that “Black girls were nearly two times more likely to receive one or more in-school suspensions, one or more out-of-school suspensions, and expulsions than White girls.” \nIn addition, Black school-aged girls are four times more likely to be arrested in school than white girls, according to research discussed on Kelly’s web page. \nJohn Berkley, coordinator for the National Pan-Hellenic Council in Maryland, Virginia and several other states, said that Maryland has many organizations working to help Black women. Knowing that Congress is backing them up with legislation would be a huge boost, he said.\n“Now they could say that Its not only a community effort but also a national policy that we now have some teeth behind,” Berkley said. “And maybe with that, that will bring more awareness to whats going on with Black females in our various raised communities.” \nBerkley said that he plans to travel with his fraternity to Annapolis in a couple of weeks to talk to his legislators to see what they’re doing to help Congress move the bill along. \nLawson said the task force could lead to the creation of more programs and organizations like hers, where Black women are free to focus on themselves and have vulnerable conversations.\n“Changing the narrative, so that we can take off that cape, we can take a deep breath and exhale, and we can start to focus on ourselves,”  Lawson said."

    "title": "US components still found in Russian weapons against Ukraine, experts tell Congress",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  American-made semiconductors and other parts have been found in Russian weapons used against Ukraine, even with strict Biden administration sanctions, experts told a Senate panel on Tuesday.\n“American manufacturers are fueling and supporting the growing and gargantuan Russian war machine,” Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Connecticut, said in a hearing by the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee’s investigations subcommittee. “Our sanctions system is a sieve, our export control regime is lethally ineffective and something has to be done.”\nBlumenthal, the chairman of the investigations panel, said Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky handed him a folder during the senators visit to Ukraine last weekend containing evidence of American components being used against Ukrainians.\nIncluded in this folder, the senator said, was a list of 211 chips, semiconductors and other technology embedded in missiles and other military products used by the Russians to kill Ukrainians.\nOf these 211 pieces, Blumenthal said 87 were made by four U.S. companies: Intel, Analog Devices, AMD and Texas Instruments.\nThe four companies have been scrutinized by the subcommittee because they increased shipments of their products to countries likely being used by Russia to avoid United States export controls – including Georgia, Kazakhstan and Turkey — since the Russian invasion of Ukraine two years ago.\nThe Biden administration halted direct exports of semiconductors to Russia and exports of foreign-made products that use American technology in 2022.\nSemiconductors are the brains of almost all modern weapons, and the United States is the most sophisticated manufacturer, according to James Byrne, the director of the open source intelligence and analysis department of the Royal United Services Institute.\n“It is technology that fits into those systems and the Russians cannot simply replace,” Byrne said during the hearing. “In that sense, we have great leverage.”\nThe parts are likely being sent to Russia from countries not subject to United States export controls, including Russian border states, said Elina Ribakova, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a non-profit research organization based in Washington. She also is vice president for foreign policy at the Kyiv School of Economics.\nByrne stressed that although export controls and sanctions are difficult to enforce, this leverage that the United States has in the semiconductor business means that the government should do its best to tighten restrictions.\nBut the existing limitations have not stopped Russia from obtaining this technology, according to Damien Spleeters, deputy director of operations for Conflict Armament Research, a British-based organization that tracks weapons and ammunition in war zones.\nSpleeters said some components found in Russian military equipment were made before 2022, implying that the country was stockpiling before the invasion. Now his organization is finding more pieces that were produced after the Russian invasion.\nOver 70% of foreign components in Russian weapons are manufactured in the United States, according to Ukraine’s National Agency for Corruption Prevention.\nAlthough there was a drop immediately after the invasion, Russian imports of battlefield goods were only 10% less than before the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, according to data from the Kyiv School of Economics.\n“Russia has been so successful in evading U.S. export controls that its ability to import critical battlefield goods nearly recovered to levels seen before the invasion of Ukraine,” Blumenthal said. “That status quo is unacceptable.”\nRussia isn’t alone in using American-manufactured components in their weapons systems. Iran and North Korea also use American parts in their weapons, Spleeters said.\nTo stop the import of such products to Russia and other United States adversaries, experts urged the government to focus on tracking where products are being distributed to and figuring out how to close loopholes in the sanctions system.\nRibakova wrote in a Financial Times opinion piece Tuesday that “the consequences of non-compliance must be strong enough to affect companies.”\nThe hearing came days after the United States announced hundreds of new sanctions against Russia."

    "title": "Top pro-Israel group boosted political spending after Oct. 7 Hamas attacks",
    "content": "WASHINGTON — In the months following Hamas’ Oct. 7 attacks on Israel, the preeminent pro-Israel lobbying group in the United States increased its political spending nearly threefold, according to an analysis of the organization’s 2023 year-end filing with the Federal Election Commission.\n“Our focus in (the) 2024 election is to broaden and strengthen the bipartisan pro-Israel majority in Congress – and to defeat anti-Israel detractors,” Marshall Wittmann, spokesman for the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), told Capital News Service in an email.\n“In the aftermath of the Hamas barbaric attack and the mounting threats of Iranian terrorist proxies, the importance of a pro-Israel Congress standing with our ally is clearer than ever,” Wittmann said.\nAIPAC has been a political force lobbying on behalf of the state of Israel since 1961. The group established its political action committee (PAC) ahead of the 2022 primaries, enabling it to contribute directly to candidates’ campaigns — which it did to the tune of over $17 million throughout the subsequent election cycle.\nDuring the current election cycle, AIPAC’s PAC has already spent nearly $23.4 million, including $18.9 million in contributions to political campaigns, records show. The committee spent nearly half of its yearly total in the three months following Hamas’ attacks, primarily giving to lawmakers supporting aid to Israel.\n\n\n\nThe AIPAC PAC spent an average of over $275,000 every week in 2023 before October, according to its FEC filing. This average nearly tripled to over $740,000 during the fourth quarter of last year.\nGeorge Latimer, who is the main Democratic challenger to Rep. Jamaal Bowman, D-New York, received the most campaign contributions from AIPAC during that quarter. Latimer’s campaign received about a quarter of its total funding from the PAC from October to the end of 2023.\nAIPAC-affiliated super PAC United Democracy Project also spent money in Bowmans district, running ads online that suggest the lawmaker “refused to stand with Israel” for voting against a House resolution supporting that nation and condemning Hamas.\nHowever, a majority of the super PAC’s funds went towards AIPAC’s committee in 2023.\nOther top Democrats on AIPAC’s radar included Sen. Jacky Rosen of Nevada, and House Minority Leader Rep. Hakeem Jeffries of New York, whose campaigns each received more than $300,000 from the committee in the final quarter of last year. Both lawmakers championed a slew of legislation securing U.S. aid to Israel after the Oct. 7 attacks.\n“Israel has a right to exist as a Jewish and democratic state,” Jeffries said in October. “The special relationship between the United States and Israel is unbreakable. Our commitment to Israel’s security is ironclad.”\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, R-Louisiana, was the top Republican recipient of AIPAC contributions at the tail end of 2023, receiving over $246,000 during that period, despite the committee only donating $5,000 to his campaign in the previous nine months. The dramatic increase reflected Johnsons rise to the House speakership on Oct. 25.\nMost of AIPAC’s contributions to Johnson’s campaign came in November and December, after he facilitated the passage of an Israel-only defense package of over $14 billion.\nThe campaigns of Maryland Democratic Reps. Steny Hoyer and Glenn Ivey’s received $32,300 and over $17,000, respectively, in contributions from AIPAC during the same period, while Maryland Republican Rep. Andy Harris’ campaign received over $6,000.\n\n\n\nIn tandem with the group’s increased spending after Oct. 7, AIPAC’s fundraising also increased significantly during the last quarter of 2023. \nCompared to the first nine months of the year, the committee raised more than twice as much per week on average — nearly $750,000  after the Hamas attacks.\nAIPAC also increased its spending on lobbying the federal government, as evidenced in its fourth quarter lobbying disclosure form for last year. \nThe group spent over $800,000 during the final quarter of last year on lobbying for various bills and resolutions regarding U.S. cooperation with Israel and condemning Hamas and Ansarallah, commonly referred to as the Houthis.\nSince the end of January, the committee has spent nearly $600,000 on Meta ad campaigns urging members of Congress to speak out against Hamas’ continued holding of Israeli hostages.\n“Congress must continue its strong bipartisan support for Israel in its battle against Iranian terrorist proxies on its borders and to force Hamas to release all of the hostages,” Wittmann said. “The purpose of our ad campaign is to give greater visibility to the plight of the hostages and the urgency to gain their freedom.”"

    "title": "Maryland&#8217;s Moore blasts Alabama IVF ruling as &#8220;out of step&#8221; with the country",
    "content": "WASHINGTON –  Maryland Gov. Wes Moore on Friday denounced an Alabama Supreme Court ruling last week that frozen embryos have the same rights as children.\nMoore, a Democrat, said that the judges’ decision was completely “out of step” with where citizens in the country are.\n“And I think its another indication of why elections matter in this,” Moore said in an interview with Capital News Service outside the White House following a National Governors Association meeting with President Joe Biden. “Because lets not forget, the people who we elect are the ones who are also helping to appoint these judges.”\nThe unprecedented Alabama ruling stated that those who damage embryos created through in vitro fertilization (IVF) can be criminally prosecuted.\nThe decision came from a lawsuit filed by three couples against the Center for Reproductive Medicine after embryos conceived using IVF were destroyed on their watch.\nAccording to the CDC, IVF is the most popular assisted reproductive technology (ART) treatment. Approximately 2.3% of children born in the United States each year are conceived using ART.\nMoore was among nearly three dozen governors at the NGA’s winter meeting session at the White House with Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris, Cabinet members and other administration officials.\nThe governors discussed bipartisan solutions to artificial intelligence risks, disaster response and housing affordability among other issues.\n“It was a great meeting because you get a chance to see with all the other governors, both Democrat and Republican, that a lot of the opportunities and challenges we’re seeing are pretty universal,” Moore said.\nMoore said that he and Biden spoke specifically about providing support for military families and military spouses, as well as solutions to the border crisis and methods to further improve the nation’s economy.\nHe also praised Biden for his support in helping him address the housing crisis in Maryland.\nMoore noted that he recently introduced and testified on bills that would set up a state renters’ rights office, increase liquidity for first-time homebuyers, and ensure that the state works with local jurisdictions to address zoning restrictions.\n“And so were grateful that in Maryland, were gonna get a lot of big things done on housing this year,” Moore said. “But thats because its being done in partnership with the White House.”\nIn remarks to the governors gathered in the White House’s East Room, Biden thanked the states’ chief executives for being “incredible partners.”\n“Governors know the measure of success isn’t how many partisan points we score,” the president said. “It’s: Did we fix the problem?  Did we fix the problem?”\n“We disagree on how to fix the problem many times,” Biden continued. “We’re all here for one reason: to fix the problems  to get things done for families, for communities, for the country.”"

    "title": "States, industry urge Supreme Court to dump air pollution rule",
    "content": "WASHINGTON – Supreme Court justices on Wednesday appeared divided over whether the court should suspend federal air pollution regulations in upwind states until a lower court rules on a pending case against the Environmental Protection Agency.\nAt issue is the federal good neighbor rule, part of the Clean Air Act, that imposes strict pollution limits on upwind states, as their smog and fine particles travel to the East Coast downwind states, including Maryland.\nOhio, Indiana and West Virginia have sued the Environmental Protection Agency over the rule, arguing that their state plans cost less and do enough to eliminate significant pollution in downwind states. The case is pending at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit.\nThe upwind states were joined by emission-heavy industries in their emergency plea to the Supreme Court to put the EPA regulations on hold until the lower court reaches a verdict.\nJustice Ketanji Brown Jackson repeatedly questioned why the Supreme Court should intervene when no lower court has decided on the matter yet.\nIm trying to understand what the emergency is, she said.\nMathura Sridharan, who represented the upwind states, said that they were spending immense sums to comply with the federal rule at breakneck speed. The states were facing the threat of power and heating shortages, as at least some grid operators have pointed out, Sridharan said.\nJackson countered that the argument boiled down to the states not wanting to follow the law while challenging it.\nJustice Brett Kavanaugh was more open to the arguments of the upwind states.\nBoth sides have a strong public interest, in my view, he said, referring to the economic costs of stricter environmental protections.\nJudith Vale, who represented downwind states that champion the good neighbor rule, said that the costs for upwind states were less expensive than the harm their pollution caused.\nVale argued that downwind states like New York and Connecticut have issues meeting the EPAs air quality requirement and their industries, which already comply with much stricter rules, suffer.\nThe lawyer for the upwind industry groups retorted: This is not a very, very significant downwind problem. This is a minuscule problem.\nReporters and analysts at multiple news outlets anticipate that the Supreme Courts conservative majority will side with upwind states and block EPAs rule while litigation continues in lower courts.\nUp to 70% of Marylands smog and fine particle air pollution originates in upwind states, according to a report by the states Department of Environment.\nPaul Billings, senior vice president at the American Lung Association, told Capital News Service that people in downwind states like Maryland breathe dirty air because power plants in Ohio are not turning on pollution controls.\nNationwide, one in three people is exposed to unhealthy levels of air pollution, according to the associations latest report.\nThere are real consequences for everyone who breathes, Billings said about the Supreme Court case.\nThe number of days with unhealthy levels of ozone, commonly referred to as smog, are declining dramatically in Maryland. The state saw a decrease of 94% since 2000, according to data from the Maryland Department of the Environment.\nNationally, the air is getting cleaner, too. Billings ascribes the decrease in pollution to laws like the Clean Air Act. If the Supreme Court blocks EPAs good neighbor plan, Billings said, the consequences will be increased air pollution."

    "title": "Despite efforts to remove them, Confederates and segregationists live on in Capitol statues",
    "content": "WASHINGTON – February is Black History Month, an observance meant to honor and celebrate the achievements made by African Americans throughout the history of the United States.\nBut reminders of the oppression that African Americans suffered are still on display in the United States Capitol, taking the form of 12 statues of figures affiliated with the Confederate States of America and post-Civil War segregation.\nIndeed, visitors to the Capitol might be startled to see civil rights icon Rosa Parks just across the room from Confederate President Jefferson Davis. And the continued presence of Confederates and segregationists in statuary in a symbol of democracy amazes scholars as well. \n“While the effects of having Confederate statues in Washington — much less in the nations capital — should be quite clear, what still surprises me years after statues started being removed is that something like this is still a possibility,” Lester Spence, professor of political science and Africana studies at Johns Hopkins University, told Capital News Service.\nMany of the offending figures stand in the National Statuary Hall, located just steps from the Capitol’s iconic Rotunda. Once the meeting place of the U.S. House of Representatives, the massive semicircular room was transformed into a statue gallery in 1864. Under federal law, each state is allowed to provide no more than two statues to the collection.\nBy 1933, the hall became overcrowded with 65 statues making up three circular rows along the circumference. Not only did the room start to look visually unappealing but concerns also were raised about the chamber’s structural integrity. \nAs a result, Congress passed a law saying that one statue from each state could remain in Statuary Hall while the others would be relocated to other areas of the Capitol.\nToday, five statues with Confederate ties remain in Statuary Hall, including Davis and his vice president, Alexander Stephens. Four others are located in the Capitol Visitor Center, two are in the Crypt under the Rotunda, and one more is in the Hall of Columns underneath the House chamber.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n            \n                                                \n\n                                        \n                        Thumbnail 1Confederate sympathizer Uriah M. Rose, of Arkansas, placed next to former Confederate President Jefferson Davis, of Mississippi, in the National Statuary Hall. (Brennan Stewart/ Capital News Service)\nThumbnail 2Alexander H.

(Brennan Stewart/ Capital News Service)\n                    \n\n                                    \n            \n        \n        \n\nArkansas, Georgia, Mississippi and North Carolina currently have both of their two permitted statues linked to the Confederacy or segregation, while Alabama, Louisiana, South Carolina and West Virginia each have one. \nHowever, three of the 12 statues are facing replacement.\nThen-Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson signed legislation in 2019 to replace his state’s statues of Uriah Rose, a Confederate sympathizer, and James Paul Clarke, a former U.S. senator and white supremacist. They are set to be replaced with statues of civil rights activist Daisy Bates and musician Johnny Cash. \nNorth Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper signed a formal request in 2018 for the removal of the statue depicting former Gov. Charles Aycock, who served in office from 1901 to 1905 and was a supporter of segregation. Aycock is going to be replaced by evangelist Rev. Billy Graham, but there have been several delays in getting the statue to Washington.\n“When we first started the process in 2018, we were shooting for 2021 but the global pandemic and a couple of other things threw us off,” said Garrett Dimond, attorney for the North Carolina General Assembly. “We would like to do (the unveiling) in the spring, but that’s up to Congress to schedule the ceremony.”\nFor a new statue to be displayed in the Capitol, it must first go through several stages of approval at both the state and federal levels, Dimond explained. The process starts with the governor, who submits the bill for a new statue to the Joint Committee on the Library of Congress.\n“The next step is actually going through the artist selection process, putting together a full-sized clay model and then doing the complete stack— so there’s a lot of approvals that happen with that,” Dimond said. \nThe Confederate Monument Removal Act was introduced to Congress in 2017 by Rep. Barbara Lee, D-California, in the wake of the “Unite the Right” rally in Charlottesville. Under her bill, all statues depicting individuals who willingly served in the Confederate States Army would be removed from the Statuary Hall collection within 120 days.\nIn February of last year, Lee reintroduced the bill with Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Mississippi, and Sen. Cory Booker, D-New Jersey. \nThere has been no action so far on that legislation. \nRep. Steny Hoyer, D-Maryland, is another member of Congress who has pressed for the removal of the offending statues. Hoyer successfully passed bills twice in the House in 2020 and 2021 that would replace a bust of Supreme Court Chief Justice Roger Brooke Taney, who ruled in the 1857 Dred Scott decision that a Black man was not a citizen, with a bust of Supreme Court Associate Justice Thurgood Marshall, the first Black justice appointed to the high court. \nThe bill would also have removed the statues of Aycock, Clarke and Vice President John C. Calhoun, a supporter of slavery. But neither measures passed the Senate.\n“We cant change history, but we can certainly make it clear who we honor,” Hoyer said in a statement last week. “I’m proud to have led efforts to remove statues and symbols honoring Confederate and white supremacist leaders, and I lament that this is not a priority for today’s Republican House Majority.”\n“I remain committed to working with Members from either party who are committed to ensuring these symbols of hate have no place in Congress,” Hoyer added."

    "title": "Biden administration readies new sanctions against Russia, urges House to pass Ukraine aid",
    "content": "WASHINGTON — The Biden administration is preparing a new package of sanctions against Russia to be unveiled on Friday, a move to hold Vladimir Putin responsible for the recent death of Alexei Navalny and the two-year war against Ukraine.\n“We’ll have a major package announced on Friday,” Biden told reporters Tuesday at the White House before leaving for California.\nState Department spokesman Matthew Miller told reporters that the sanctions are intended “to hold Russia accountable for Navalny’s death in prison and for its actions over the course of the vicious and brutal war they have waged in Ukraine for the past two years.”\nHe declined to comment on the nature of the sanctions but confirmed that they would be unveiled Friday — one day before the two-year anniversary of Russia’s attack on Ukraine.\nThese will be the latest in the administration’s long string of sanctions against Russia since its attack on Ukraine. The most recent action taken was a December executive order to expand sanction authorities.\nMiller also stressed the need for Congress to pass the national security supplemental spending bill, containing over $60 billion in Ukrainian aid. It passed the Senate last week but faces opposition from key House leaders, including Speaker Mike Johnson, R-Louisiana.\nJohnson favors a national security bill focusing more on the southern border, even though Republicans already rejected a bipartisan immigration measure. However, House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Michael McCaul, R-Texas, said over the weekend that he sees a path forward for the bill.\nMcCaul wasn’t specific, but many Capitol Hill observers have speculated that Democrats may try to use a procedural step, known as a discharge petition, to bring the bill to the House floor.\nHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-New York, said last week “all legislative options are on the table, and that certainly includes a discharge petition.”\n“Without more support from Congress,” Miller said at the briefing, “Ukraine will not be able to replenish its air defenses, and the ammunition supplies to help protect itself from Russias aggression.”"

    "title": "As Assange faces extradition to US, experts see threats to press freedom",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  As Wikileaks founder Julian Assange’s legal team makes its last appeal to prevent an extradition to the United States over Espionage Act charges, press freedom experts said they are concerned about how the case could harm journalists First Amendment rights. \n“Its penalizing the press after the presses have run,” James Goodale, a former general counsel for the New York Times, said in a Tuesday phone interview with Capital News Service. \nThe appeal hearing began Tuesday and continues Wednesday in London’s High Court. If the court rules against Assange, he would be sent to the United States for trial within 28 days unless the extradition proceedings are stopped by the European Court of Human Rights.\nAssange is charged in relation to his 2010 release of U.S. government documents, leaked by then-Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning, which revealed details of civilian death tolls in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Wikileaks founder is charged for conspiring with Manning to hack into a Pentagon computer to release confidential military documents.\nThe Espionage Act of 1917 was enacted during World War I to prevent people from sharing government secrets that could harm national security. The act has since been used against spies and sources who send secret information to journalists, typically whistleblowers inside government agencies. \nThe act has never been successfully used against journalists or publishers of documents leaked to them by sources.\nThis shift in how the Espionage Act could be used is concerning for Seth Stern, the director of advocacy at the Freedom of the Press Foundation.\nIf the U.S. government wins this case, Stern said, it would set a precedent to prosecute “routine” investigative journalism. Even if no journalists are convicted under the espionage law, such a ruling could cause publications to self-censor over fears of government retribution, he said. \n“Well never know how much valuable news and valuable reporting we’re missing out on because newsrooms werent willing to take that risk,” Stern said.\nThis fear led Stern to write a letter to Attorney General Merrick Garland calling for charges to be dropped against Assange. The letter, later signed by over 35 law professors, pointed to a 2001 Supreme Court ruling in which justices argued that journalists have the right to publish true information even if their source obtained that information illegally. \n“Obtaining and publishing government secrets is essentially the job description for an investigative journalist,” Stern said. \nGoodale, who signed Stern’s letter, was general counsel for the New York Times in the Pentagon Papers case, known as New York Times Co. v. United States.\nThe Supreme Court ruled in favor of the newspaper in 1971 after the Nixon administration temporarily stopped newspapers from printing leaked documents about the Vietnam War, citing security concerns and the Espionage Act. The case is known for barring prior restraint by the government, thus allowing journalists to publish leaked information and protecting reporters from government interference.\nNow, Goodale believes that the case against Assange could undo the work he did on the Pentagon Papers case. Instead of stopping reporters before they publish – as Nixon’s Justice Department tried to do – this case, if Assange is convicted, would punish reporters after they publish.\n“This is the other side of the Pentagon Papers case,” Goodale said. “I do not want that victory to go to waste if, in fact, the courts turn around and say, ‘Well go ahead and publish it  but if you do, were gonna put you in jail.’”\nHe noted that journalism technology has advanced since the newspaper-centric days of the 1970s. Now reporters publish faster than ever before, meaning that it has become nearly impossible for the government to block publishing a story, he said.\n“If all criminal action is in favor of the government … the victory of the Pentagon Papers case becomes relevant only to an earlier technological time,” Goodale said. \nAs with the Pentagon Papers case, Goodale said the government has failed to prove damages to national security caused by the leaks.\n“No real damage to national security has taken place as a consequence of the publication by Julian Assange,” Goodale said. “The government has, for over 15 years now, had the ability to prove damage, or tell us, the American public, what the damage is, and they cant tell us.”\nThe case against Assange has gone through multiple administrations. The Obama Justice Department originally considered charging Assange under the Espionage Act, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, but decided not to after considering the potential pushback from journalists.\nThe Trump administration indicted Assange in 2019 and the Biden administration has continued to pursue Assange’s extradition despite calls from prominent media publishers to end the prosecution.\nJodie Ginsberg, the CEO of the Committee to Protect Journalists, said in a statement Tuesday that the prosecution of Assange “would have disastrous implications for press freedom both in the U.S. and globally.”\nThis reiterates the committee’s 2022 position, in which it called the Assange prosecution hostile to the media and democracy itself.”\nState Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said during a Tuesday briefing that while the government supports an independent free press, hacking into a government computer is a crime. \n“It is true that at times the publication of classified government documents will inform the public and sometimes it will uncover wrongdoing, it’s also true that sometimes the publication of classified government documents serves no underlying purpose and can jeopardize sources and methods that the government uses to keep the American public safe,” Miller said. \nAssange is a controversial figure to many around the world due to his political stances, methods of gathering information and previous interactions with the law – including a rape allegation. Others question if Assange qualifies as a journalist.\nBut Stern said “its a distraction to focus on Assange the person.”\n“Legal precedents arent limited to one individual and can be applied against whatever journalists might get on the bad side of this administration or a future one,” he said."

    "title": "Maryland&#8217;s House Democrats press Republicans to pass Ukraine aid",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  Maryland’s House Democrats are criticizing Speaker Mike Johnson, R-Louisiana, for refusing to hear the Senate-approved foreign aid package that includes Ukraine and Israel.\n“Give the victims of Putin’s war crimes a vote, Mr. Speaker,” Rep. Steny Hoyer, D-Maryland, said on the House floor Thursday. “Give Ukraine hope, Mr. Speaker. Tell Putin: ‘Nyet.’ Every minute we don’t signals retreat instead of resolve.”\nThe Senate passed the $95 billion national security supplemental spending bill Tuesday. The measure would allot funding, including military support and humanitarian aid, for Ukraine, Israel, Gaza and Taiwan.\nJohnson has firmly rejected calls to put the bill to a vote in the House due to the lack of border security legislation. But the speaker also has rejected a bipartisan compromise on border security crafted in the Senate.\nIn a Monday statement, Johnson said House Republicans were “crystal clear” that national security supplemental legislation “must recognize that national security begins at our own border.”\nThe foreign aid bill was attached to border security legislation until Senate Republicans voted against the bill Wednesday because they said the border policies didn’t go far enough. Majority Leader Sen. Chuck Shumer, D-New York, then introduced the new bill without border legislation.\nThe national security package passed 70-29, with support from 22 Republican senators.\nHoyer said that if Johnson were to put the bill on the House floor, they it would have at least 300 votes to pass.\n“The question is not whether this legislation would receive enough votes to pass this house,” Hoyer said. “The question is whether Speaker Johnson will give us the opportunity to vote on it at all. Refusal to do so is causing Ukrainians to die.”\nThe congressman further said that Russian leader Vladimir Putin “salivates” at the inaction of the “isolationist or authoritarian loving factions” of House Republicans.\nRep. David Trone, who is running in the Maryland Democratic primary for the Senate, called Johnson’s reluctance to bring the foreign aid bill a “dereliction of duty and a shameless abandonment of America’s allies” in an X post Tuesday.\nTrone added that “it’s time for House Republicans to step up and govern.”\nRep. Jamie Raskin, D–Maryland, accused House Republicans of taking orders from former President Donald Trump in a Wednesday interview with MSNBC. Raskin said the Senate was the best hope for bipartisan compromises, adding that the House Republicans fall in line with those on the MAGA right.\n“I think our best hope for trying to torture out some bipartisan compromises that will allow America to stand on the side of freedom and democracy and human rights around the world is on the Senate side,” Raskin said.\nIn an email statement to Capital News Service, Rep. John Sarbanes, D–Maryland, said the aid bill is the “right framework” for moving forward on critical priorities and encouraged Johnson to consider the measure.\n“The Senate took a crucial step in supporting our allies Israel and Ukraine and addressing the humanitarian crisis in Gaza,” Sarbanes said. “I urge Speaker Johnson to give it the consideration it deserves.”\nSome House Democrats, including Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D–New York, seem to support using a discharge petition to circumvent the unwavering speaker.\nJeffries said Tuesday he would use “every available legislative tool” to move the aid bill forward.\nA discharge petition would require a majority of House members to pass. With the Republicans holding a narrow 219-213 advantage, Democrats would have to find some Republicans willing to go against their party leadership.\nThe Senate-approved bill would allocate $60 billion to support Ukraine’s defense against Russia, including funding to allow Ukraine to re-arm itself and to receive U.S. military intelligence and training support.\nThe Senate slated $14 billion security assistance to Israel. This would fund Israel missile defense capabilities and the Iron Beam missile defense system  a laser system that can detect and strike incoming missiles.\nNine billion dollars would go towards humanitarian assistance to populations in war zones and potential regions of conflict, including Ukraine, Gaza and the West Bank, East Africa and South Asia.\nMaryland’s two senators, who voted for the package, have expressed concerns about both the treacherous political road the bill went down and policies left in and out of the final measure.\nSen. Chris Van Hollen, D–Maryland, said earlier this week it was critical to pass humanitarian aid and to deploy resources to protect democracy around the world, including to Ukraine, which the senator said is running “dangerously low on ammunition and other vital supplies.”\n“We know all too well that this is not only a fight to save Ukraine – our adversaries and allies alike are watching closely, and the outcome will have implications on American security and security across the globe,” Van Hollen said in a statement.\nVan Hollen said that while he supports funding for defensive weapons and Israel’s right to defend itself, the “humanitarian catastrophe” in Gaza is too great to ignore.\n“While a war may be just, it must be fought justly. I cannot support a blank check for the Netanyahu government’s current campaign in Gaza,” Van Hollen said.    Sen. Ben Cardin, D-Maryland, said earlier this week that while the passage of the foreign aid bill was a “cause for celebration,” partisanship is blocking final passage.\nThe senator also said the lack of a border policy in the bill “represents a failure of governance and a disservice to our national security.”"

    "title": "Anti-war protesters confront House hearing on Houthi threat",
    "content": "WASHINGTON — As lawmakers reviewed increasing Houthi attacks on ships in the Red Sea, anti-war protesters confronted a House hearing Wednesday over U.S. military involvement in the Middle East.\nRepresentatives of the antiwar group Code Pink sat in the audience at the House Foreign Affairs Committee’s Middle East, North Africa and Central Asia subcommittee, with their raised hands covered in red paint, chanting “Long Live Palestine!” \nSeveral demonstrators were escorted from the hearing by the U.S. Capitol Police. \n“I fear that not only are we going to see a continuation of the slaughtering in Gaza, but were going to see a regional war,” Medea Benjamin, a co-founder of Code Pink, told Capital News Service after the demonstration.\nThe Houthis, a militant Yemeni group backed by Iran, began attacking vessels in the Red Sea, which accounts for about 12 percent of world commerce, after the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel, purportedly out of solidarity with the Palestinian people.\nIn a statement from the Houthi military, the group said that it will “continue carrying out (attacks) until the aggression on the Gaza Strip and the crimes against our Palestinian brothers come to a halt.”\nMost recently, Houthi militants fired two missiles at a cargo ship on Monday after a series of attacks from the U.S. Central Command over the weekend on unmanned Houthi targets. A Houthi-backed news agency reported that these attacks killed 17 of the group’s members.\n“You dont hear one of these Congress people say that the way to stop the disruption of commercial shipping in the Red Sea is to have a ceasefire in Gaza,” Benjamin said.\nThe Biden administration last month announced its decision to designate the Houthis as a global terrorist group, changing a 2021 decision to remove the Houthis’ terrorist status in “recognition of the dire humanitarian situation in Yemen.” This redesignation takes effect on Saturday.\nRepublicans continue to voice their dissatisfaction with Biden’s decision, maintaining that the Houthis should be recognized as a more severe threat to American interests. GOP lawmakers also called for further trade sanctions against Yemen and individuals supporting the Houthis.\n“When President Biden took office, he made a lot of ill thought-out and frankly foolish foreign policy decisions, but at the top of the list was delisting the Houthis,” Rep. Mike Lawler, R-New York, charged during the hearing.\nSimone Ledeen, former deputy assistant defense secretary for the Middle East under President Donald Trump, told the panel that the Biden administration did “the bare minimum” in its response to the Houthi attacks.\nLedeen, who is now a senior fellow at the Strauss Center for International Security and Law at the University of Texas-Austin, said that U.S. partners and allies will see that the country is not taking real action until a more forceful response is initiated.\nRep. Brad Sherman, D-California, heatedly addressed the Code Pink protesters, saying that those who try to prevent the United States from taking action against the Houthis have blood on their hands.\n“A durable ceasefire cannot exist if Hamas is (in Gaza) because they’ve already declared they want to repeat October 7th again and again until the blood of Israelis flows again and again,” Sherman shouted over the protesters’ chants."

    "title": "Van Hollen, Democrats plan push for stronger policy protecting civilians from American weapons used by allies",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  Even though the White House has taken steps aimed at protecting civilians from American weapons in war zones, Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Maryland, said Tuesday that he would press for a stronger response, especially in light of Israel’s continued bombardment of Gaza.\n“I fully support Israel’s right, indeed its duty, to defend itself,” the senator said in a statement. “But while a war may be just, it must be fought justly. I cannot support a blank check for the Netanyahu government’s current campaign in Gaza. The disregard for innocent civilian life and the mounting humanitarian catastrophe are too great to turn a blind eye.”\nVan Hollen praised a national security memorandum issued last Friday by President Joe Biden in which he outlined U.S. policy on safeguarding civilians in places where American weapons and military equipment are used. Israel is not specifically mentioned in the memorandum.\n“As a matter of policy, the United States always seeks to promote adherence to international law and encourages other states and partners to do the same,” the memorandum states. “United States policy…is for executive departments and agencies to engage with foreign partners to share and learn best practices for reducing the likelihood of and responding to civilian casualties…”\nThe memorandum was similar to an amendment Van Hollen announced with his colleagues on Feb. 7. It was not included in the national security supplemental spending bill passed yesterday.\nAccording to the memorandum, before receiving United States military aid, countries must confirm in writing that they will comply with international humanitarian law.\n“This is a very big deal, and it will give President Biden and the United States more tools and more leverage to ensure… that U.S. military assistance, complies with American values and American interests,” Van Hollen said during a press conference last Friday.\nCountries must also promise not to hinder the United States’ ability to provide humanitarian assistance to conflict areas where American weapons are being used.\nAccording to the Associated Press, the number of Palestinians killed in the Israel-Hamas war, which began after the militant group Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7, surpassed 25,000 on Jan. 21.\nThe Van Hollen amendment had 18 sponsors, including Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Virginia, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Massachusetts, Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Illinois, and Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Oregon.\n“This extreme level of civilian harm in Gaza is a moral failure, and now it is fueling an even wider conflict in the region,” Warren said.\nVan Hollen said that he and his colleagues will work to turn the Biden policy into law, preventing future administrations from easily reversing it.\n“Its been rolling a rock uphill,” Warren said regarding making changes to United States military aid policy in the past. “When it feels like the conflict is far away and nobody knows who the parties are and whats actually happening on the ground, its hard to get Congress to move.”\nMerkley and Van Hollen traveled to the Rafah border crossing from Gaza into the Sinai in early January and saw first-hand how the conflict and deplorable conditions created difficulty getting aid to the hospitals and warehouses in the region.\n“These factors together have caused the seasoned humanitarian workers who have worked in the worst conflicts in the world to tell Chris and I, when we were at the Rafah gate, that they have never seen anything as bad as Gaza,” Merkley said.\nThe Van Hollen amendment only applied to countries receiving military aid from the United States under the national security supplemental spending bill. The Biden memorandum now applies to all countries receiving United States military assistance, including Ukraine and Israel.\nKaine said that he and his colleagues got on a call with the White House about their amendment in December expecting more resistance. While there was some pushback, Kaine said that no one ever came up with any substantive reason to oppose the principles of the amendment.\n“Human rights should not be separate from the American defense mission,” Kaine said. “And when we determined that its in our interest to assist an ally, that ally should conduct itself in the way we would.”\nDurbin made it clear that he and his colleagues support Israel’s defense. However, he acknowledged that members of Hamas hiding among civilians in the area has helped create a “humanitarian nightmare.”\n“We still need to demand and require realistic effective standards to reduce civilian harm,” Durbin said.\nCountries currently engaged in war using United States weapons have 45 days to ensure that Biden receives the written assurances that they are adhering to international law. If those countries don’t meet the deadline, then the United States will suspend their assistance.\nTo ensure that countries are complying with the best practices for reducing civilian harm, the State Department and the Defense Department must submit reports to Congress discussing weapons usage in areas of armed conflict.\nReports must be submitted within 90 days and include information on weapons usage dating back to Jan. 2023."

    "title": "Supreme Court will decide if cities can punish homelessness while a record number of people sleep on the street",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  More homeless people than ever sleep on the streets.\nThe U.S. Supreme Court will decide if local governments can punish homeless people who sleep or camp outside when no shelter beds are available, or if such laws violate the Eight Amendments protection against cruel and unusual punishment.\nThe issue came to the court from the small Oregon city of Grants Pass, which has more homeless people than shelter beds. City ordinances prohibit those people from sleeping on the street or in parks if they use a blanket or cardboard box as protection from the weather. Three homeless people filed a complaint against the city, and a district court ruled that the city cant enforce that law.\nThe Supreme Court is expected to hear oral arguments in late April.\nElected officials including California Gov. Gavin Newsom urged the Supreme Court to take the case and side with Grants Pass.\nIn a statement, Newsom said that the courts have tied the hands of state and local governments that seek to use common sense approaches to clean our streets and provide help for unhoused Californians living in inhumane conditions.\nIn an amicus brief to the Supreme Court, Newsom argued that local governments need the flexibility toaddress immediate threats to health and safety in public places  both to individuals living in unsafe encampment and other members of the public impacted by them.\nEd Johnson, lead counsel for the homeless respondents in the Supreme Court case, said in a written statement: This case is not about a city’s ability to regulate or prohibit encampments. That has always been permissible. Instead, the issue is whether cities can punish homeless residents for simply existing without access to shelter, he said.\nThe Supreme Court decided to take on the case amid what Jesse Rabinowitz at the advocacy organization National Homelessness Law Center (NHLC) calls a nationwide movementto criminalize people experiencing homelessness.\nIn an analysis of 187 city laws from 2006 to 2019, NHLC found a vast increase in laws targeting visible homelessness, such as panhandling and sleeping in public.\nIts sad that cities are throwing up their hands and saying the only way we can end homelessness is by arresting people, Rabinowitz said.\nIn recent years, the NHLC recorded an increase in state-level efforts to criminalize homelessness. As of Jan. 24, 11 states had seen bills criminalizing homelessness introduced or passed, according to the organization.\nWhile criminalization efforts increase, the number of homeless people sleeping on the streets reached an all-time high in 2023. In a single night, 256,104 people were counted as unhoused across the United States, according to the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development.\nThe data is collected nationwide every year on a specific night and goes back to 2007, the year with the second-highest number of homeless people sleeping outside.\n\nAn analysis of the nationwide data shows that there was a nationwide downward trend in unsheltered homelessness until 2015, after which the number steadily increased for five years.\nThe 2020 count took place before the coronavirus pandemic swept the country. The effects of the virus and measures against its spread impacted the 2021 survey that shows a sharp drop in unsheltered homelessness, often attributed to federal moratoriums on evictions, among other causes.\nSince then, the number of unsheltered homeless people has increased again, peaking in 2023.\nIn contrast to the national trend, Maryland has significantly reduced homelessness over the last 14 years, according to HUD data.\n\nThe numbers for 2021 and 2022 were suppressed by the pandemic, Danielle Meister, assistant secretary for homeless solutions at the Maryland Department of Housing and Community Development, said in a statement.\nCompared to 2020, 7.8% fewer people were homeless in 2023. The number of homeless people sleeping outside plummeted by 23%.\nAccording to Jake Day, Maryland’s secretary of housing and community development, the state is within striking distance of ending homelessness for veterans, unaccompanied youth and domestic violence survivors.\nTo reach that goal, the department needs to focus on solutions that work: reducing housing instability, lowering barriers to services, and investing in permanent supportive housing, Day said in a statement.\nRabinowitz said that he hopes the Supreme Court will uphold the lower courts precedent and side with homeless people. Criminalizing people experiencing homelessness keeps them homeless longer, he said. When folks get the housing they need, they thrive."

    "title": "House committee passes bill streamlining US arms sales",
    "content": "WASHINGTON — After U.S. arms exports hit a record high in 2023, the House Foreign Affairs Committee voted to advance legislation aimed at speeding up U.S. arms exports.\nCritics are concerned that transparency will be the victim of the legislation, which amends the Arms Export Control Act to increase the thresholds for reporting to Congress arms exports to other countries.\nRep. Michael Waltz, R-Florida, introduced the legislation in December. The measure is  cosponsored by two Democrats, Reps. Seth Moulton of Massachusetts and Jared Moskowitz of Florida. Moskowitz was the only Democrat in the foreign affairs panel to vote in favor of the bill.\n“We should learn from Ukraine and simplify this bureaucracy so that they can do the fighting for their interest with less involvement from the United States,” Waltz said during the hearing.\nBut Kathy Manning, D-North Carolina, objected to the measure during a foreign affairs committee hearing last week.\n“The real impact of the bill is to diminish our constitutional oversight duty and our responsibility as legislators with the prospect of less oversight,” Manning said. “This is not simply an inflation fix.”  \nCurrent regulations require that Congress be informed of exports of at least $200 million in military design and construction services, $50 million in defense technology, $14 million in major defense equipment, or $1 million in certain other categories of weapons.\nThresholds are higher for members of NATO as well as for Australia, Israel, Japan, South Korea and New Zealand. For these transactions, the president must notify Congress 15 days in advance of the transfer, whereas most other contracts require a 30-day review period.\nSales in these categories are subject to congressional review.\nWaltz’s legislation increases the dollar thresholds by at least 60%. The bill also allows the secretary of state to complete arms sales or transfers that have been delayed by Congress for three years.\nRep. Warren Davidson, R-Ohio, introduced the bill’s only amendment, calling for the secretary of state to report annually to Congress which countries’ major defense purchases exceeded the thresholds in the current arms export law. The amendment was rejected by a vote of 25-21.\n“(This bill) comes in the context of a lot of concern over how weak the safeguards are for U.S. security cooperation and for U.S. arms transfers,” said Elias Yousif, a research analyst with the Henry L. Stimson Center’s Conventional Defense Program. The Stimson Center is a nonpartisan think tank in Washington. \n“In the context of those concerns, these reforms seem especially untimely,” Yousif said.\n\n\n\nAccording to the State Department, the United States government last year transferred $80.9 billion in arms to other nations — the highest annual total in history. Commercial arms sales between U.S. manufacturers and other countries authorized by the department during the same period totalled $157.5 billion.\nPoland received nearly $42 billion in arms transfers from the U.S. government last year, after the Biden administration signed a $2 billion loan to modernize that country’s military, citing its “central support role in facilitating international assistance to neighboring Ukraine.”\n\n\n\nLast December, the State Department waived congressional review twice to fulfill requests from Israel for tank and artillery ammunition worth a combined $254 million.\nA group of 19 Democratic lawmakers penned a letter last month to Secretary of State Antony Blinken, asking why the administration waived congressional review for those arms sales to Israel.\n“It is essential for Congress to be able to conduct oversight of these arms transfers and determine whether they are consistent with humanitarian principles and U.S. law, and whether they advance or harm U.S. national security,” the lawmakers wrote. \n“We appreciate that your administration has repeatedly urged the Israeli government to take additional steps to reduce civilian casualties,” the Democrats added. “However, we are concerned that these transfers and the administration’s evasion of congressional oversight may be inconsistent with broader U.S. foreign policy goals.” \nSen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vermont, one of the lawmakers who signed the Blinken letter, also introduced a resolution demanding a summary of U.S. weapons sold to Israel since the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks, and how those weapons are being used by the Israeli Defense Force (IDF). The Senate voted 72-11 table this resolution.\nIn a December report, Amnesty International said that the IDF used U.S.-made missiles, known as JDAMs, in two separate bombings on the Gaza Strip last October, claiming the lives of at least 62 civilians. Bloomberg reported a few weeks later that after Oct. 7, Boeing expedited deliveries of about 1,800 JDAM kits under a 2021 sale.\nHuman Rights Watch in 2018 raised similar concerns regarding the use of U.S. weapons in the Saudi-led coalition’s air campaign against the Houthis in Yemen that killed many civilians.\nA subsequent review by the State Department Inspector General’s Office of arms transfers to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates determined that the agency failed to fully assess the measures required to avoid civilian casualties when authorizing the transfers.\n“At a time when lawmakers were raising very serious humanitarian concerns about the U.S. defense partnership with Saudi Arabia and the Emirates, many thousands of pieces of equipment worth many billions of dollars were still flowing really without their oversight, without their say,” Yousif said. “And so you can imagine that raising notification thresholds just puts so many more of those transfers below the radar.”"

    "title": "Maryland&#8217;s Hogan makes surprise entry into GOP race for US Senate",
    "content": "WASHINGTON – Former Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan will run for a seat in the U.S. Senate.\nHogan, a Republican, announced his campaign on Friday via social media, releasing a video just nine hours before Maryland’s candidacy deadline and surprising a lot of political observers.\n“Fifty years ago, my father, Maryland congressman Larry Hogan Sr., made a very tough decision. He became the first Republican to come out for the impeachment of President Nixon,” Hogan said. “He put aside party politics and his own personal considerations, and he stepped up to do the right thing for Maryland and the nation.”\n“Today, Washington is completely broken, because that kind of leadership, that kind of willingness to put country over party, has become far too rare,” Hogan added.\nHogan joins the list of 20 candidates fighting for outgoing Sen. Ben Cardin’s seat. Cardin, a Democrat, announced in May his plan to retire at the end of his current term.\nNotable Senate candidates include Democrats Angela Alsobrooks, Prince George’s County executive, and Rep. David Trone, as well as Republicans Robin Ficker, a former member of the Maryland House of Delegates and a perennial candidate for various offices, and John Teichert, a retired Air Force brigadier general.\n“The beauty of living in this great republic that I fought to defend for over three decades is that we give Americans a choice about who represents us in elected public office,” Teichert said in a statement released Friday. “Marylanders deserve to have a choice and I welcome anyone to the race who wants to offer them one.”\nIf elected, Hogan would become Maryland’s first Republican senator since Charles Mathias, who served in the Senate from 1969 to 1987.\n“He’s the only Republican in the state who stands a chance,” Todd Eberly, associate professor of political science and public policy at St. Marys College of Maryland, told Capital News Service.\n“His chances depend on a couple of factors,” said John Dedie, political science professor at the Community College of Baltimore County. “First, if the Trone, Alsobrooks primary gets contested with nastiness and they cant make peace after the primary… that could help Hogan because maybe one side stays home and doesnt vote.”\nAccording to Dedie, Hogan will have to focus on his accomplishments during his two terms as governor and his work with the Democrats. He may have to criticize Republicans, but then some of those voters may stay home, Dedie said.\nTrone said in a statement that Hogan’s bid is an attempt to boost the agenda of Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, and former President Donald Trump.\n“Larry Hogan’s candidacy is nothing but a desperate attempt to return Mitch McConnell and Donald Trump to power and give them the deciding vote to ban abortion nationwide, suppress votes across the country, and give massive tax cuts to the wealthiest Americans,” Trone said in a statement.\nHogan has always said that he is pro-life, according to Dedie. On this year’s ballot, Maryland voters will see a “measure of basically codified abortion rights into the state constitution,” which will affect Hogan’s campaign, Dedie said.\nCardin believes that the Republican nominee for Senate will be in a tough battle against Democratic candidates Alsobrooks and Trone for the seat.\n“Regardless of who is the Republican nominee, I am confident that Marylanders will keep our state in the blue column this November, holding the Senate as a bulwark against a dysfunctional and chaotic House of Representatives, Cardin said in a statement.\nAccording to Bloomberg, McConnell recruited Hogan.\n“This is the best one in the sense that we are now competitive in a state nobody thought we could win. He’s a proven winner,” McConnell told Bloomberg.\nMaryland’s primary election is May 14, giving Hogan just three months to campaign.\nSabato’s Crystal Ball at the University of Virginia’s Center for Politics slightly changed its rating for the Maryland Senate race after Hogan’s announcement from “Safe Democratic” to “Likely Democratic,” a reflection of the former governor’s immediate impact on the contest.\nIn Annapolis, one Republican lawmaker said he wouldn’t count Hogan out.\n“I certainly believe that Governor Hogan feels that he has a path to victory, or else he would not get into the race,” said State Senate Minority Leader Stephen Hershey, R-Caroline, Cecil, Kent and Queen Annes counties. “He certainly has a chance. Hes proven that he can win in Maryland, on a statewide basis … He has found a way to map that out and believes that he can be successful.”\nBut another fellow Republican asserted that running on the ticket with Trump would be no easy task for Hogan.\nHouse Minority Leader Jason Buckel, R-Allegany, told CNS that Hogan’s announcement took him by surprise.\n“It’s going to be an uphill climb,” Buckel said. “He’ll have to navigate being on the ticket with Donald Trump … and it will be a challenge for him.”"

    "title": "Annual Smithsonian orchid exhibit highlights plant conservation and protection",
    "content": "WASHINGTON – Nothing like a stroll through wild orchids to chase the February blues away.\nSmithsonian Gardens and the United States Botanic Garden have opened their annual orchid exhibit. This year’s theme is “The Future of Orchids: Conservation and Collaboration.”\nThe exhibit, which opened Jan. 27 and is displayed in the Kogod Courtyard at the Smithsonian National Portrait Gallery, includes around 350 live orchids and original artwork by Baltimore-based artist Phaan Howng.\nThe installation addresses the importance of plant conservation and the issues affecting orchids around the world. Each flower bed is categorized by a collaboration with a specific group working toward the conservation of orchids, such as researchers, schools, public gardens and others.\nWASHINGTON  The Smithsonian exhibit includes 350 live orchids, such as this species, the Cymbidium Clarisse Austin. (Yesenia Montenegro/Capital News Service)\n“Everybody has an idea of what an orchid looks like and it’s from a corsage probably, or from the plants you can get at the grocery store,” said Sarah Christianson, a Smithsonian Gardens volunteer interpreter for the exhibit. “But those are just the hybrids that are easy to grow. Whereas here we have species of orchids which are wild, not hybridized. And some of them are just incredibly different from what your image is.”\n“The diversity is mind-boggling. The colors are fantastic. The difference is amazing,” said Deborah Zavos, a museum visitor from DC.\nHowng’s art is in the form of tree wraps, brightly colored planters, model mountains and other objects distributed throughout the exhibit.\nHighlights of the exhibit are Howng’s 3D-printed orchids, which allow viewers to see intricate details of the flowers that otherwise might not be as clear. Howng worked with 3D printing for the first time for this exhibit.\n\nWASHINGTON  Artist Phaan Howng used scans of live orchids to create her own 3D-printed models. (Yesenia Montenegro/Capital News Service)\nHowng said she drew inspiration from Robert Brendel’s botanical models from the late 1800s while creating her 3D prints. Brendel’s models could be taken apart, similar to Howng’s work, and were designed to aid in the study of botany.\n“I based them off the Brendel models because I liked the idea that we’re teaching everyone about orchids, and the Brendel models are a nod to that old-school type of teaching,” Howng said.\nHowng received 3D scans of various orchid species from the Smithsonian, which inspired the designs of her printed flowers. She spent around three months working on pieces for the exhibit.\nCompared to her other projects, which also often focus on nature, this exhibit is geared toward a much broader audience, Howng said. She wanted her work to have educational concepts and wanted people to learn from it.\n“I love how theyre naturally so inventive to serve their purpose,” Howng said. “Different orchids have different engineering to them in order to be pollinated… They develop these certain patterns as a way to attract the specific pollinators. The mechanics of each orchid is so particular and specific that its just so wild.”\n\nWASHINGTON  The exhibit was designed to fluidly combine art pieces with living plants. (Yesenia Montenegro/Capital News Service)\nSmithsonian Gardens has a greenhouse facility in Suitland, Maryland, where the orchid collection, made up of almost 5000 plants, is stored. A portion of the plants in the exhibit also comes from the United States Botanic Garden’s collection. The plants will be refreshed and swapped out as needed, ensuring that the exhibit always presents blooming flowers.\nThe Smithsonian Gardens collection started in the 1970s and has grown immensely over the years. It consists mainly of orchids from Central America, the Caribbean and South America, according to Justin Kondrat, the lead horticulturist within the Smithsonian Gardens orchid collection.\nThe collection is managed with a focus on conservation, outreach, display, innovation and education. The facility ensures that the plants are safeguarded and that they can be propagated and shared with other institutions that can protect them.\n“As a living collection nothing is stagnant. Its constantly changing and evolving with the times,” Kondrat said.\nAccording to Kondrat, orchids are an indicator species, meaning they can show the health of an environment. Most orchids have coevolved with their pollinators over millions of years, so the two parts are interconnected and rely on each other.\n“When it comes to orchids, climate change will definitely impact when it comes to those plants because they are so sensitive in certain areas,” Kondrat said. “Some orchids are resilient, but when your whole environment or ecosystem is destroyed… that really impacts… the willingness for them to survive.”\nThe exhibit provides visitors with the opportunity to see orchid species that are uncommon and look different than many expect. (Yesenia Montenegro/Capital News Service)\nKondrat hopes that the exhibit showcases the importance of collaboration and coming together to preserve something. The orchids shouldn’t just be safeguarded, but they should thrive, he said.\n“My favorite part is the way that the signage is really crediting collaboration with the whole trying to maintain a future for orchids,” said Chuck Dulaney, a museum visitor and member of Master Gardener, a nationwide program that trains volunteers in sustainable urban gardening. “They’re such delicate things and when the environment gets messed up… one of the first things that’s going to suffer are the orchids.”\nThe 28th annual exhibit runs until April 28."

    "title": "Senators grill pharmaceutical CEOs on the high cost of prescription drugs in the U.S.",
    "content": "WASHINGTON — Senators have rebuked CEOs of three major U.S.-based pharmaceutical companies for the high cost of prescription drugs in America.\n“There is a lot of discussion in our nation about how divided our people are on many issues. That is absolutely true,” said the panel’s chairman, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vermont, “but on one of the most important issues facing our country, the American people… could not be more united, and that is the need to substantially lower the outrageous price of prescription drugs in this country.”\nMerck and Johnson  Johnson initially declined to testify at Thursday’s hearing of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, prompting Sanders to announce a committee vote to subpoena the companies’ CEOs. Both companies responded with letters accusing Sanders of targeting them for their lawsuits against the federal government over the price negotiation provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act.\nBefore the subpoena vote, the companies announced that they would agree to voluntarily testify. The witnesses included Joaquin Duato of Johnson  Johnson, Robert Davis of Merck, and Chris Boerner, of Bristol Myers Squibb (BMS).\nIn his introduction, Sanders cited a recent poll published by the Kaiser Family Foundation showing that 82 percent of American adults say the cost of prescription drugs is unreasonable, while 73 percent believe that there is not enough government regulation limiting that cost.\n\nAccording to a report published by the committee’s majority staff before the hearing, several key treatments offered by Johnson  Johnson, Merck, and BMS require U.S. patients to pay much more for drugs on an annual basis than those in other countries pay for the same drugs.\n“Are the prices that you receive from countries like Canada or France — which look to me to be about one quarter of the price you get from the United States — … covering your costs?” Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Connecticut, asked.\nDuato said that Johnson  Johnson is making a profit on selling treatments in those countries, and that the real difference between U.S. patients and those in other countries is that American patients get access to pharmaceutical therapies years before international patients. \nHe added that price caps on drugs are “not the way innovation is going to be fostered,” echoing the stated reasoning in Janssen Pharmaceuticals’ lawsuit against the Department of Health and Human Services and Centers for Medicare  Medicaid Services.\nThe lawsuit filed by Janssen, a Johnson  Johnson company, argues that “the U.S. innovation ecosystem to which Janssen contributes has two vital components” that are threatened by the Inflation Reduction Act’s drug price negotiation program.\nJanssen’s lawyers said these components are the agreement between the federal government and drugmakers when the FDA approves new treatments, and “the operation of free-market forces to establish prices for medicines during and after their patent terms.”\nBut senators questioned the companies’ commitment to innovation, citing the findings of a recent study revealing that manufacturers of drugs chosen for Medicare negotiation spent more overall on stock buybacks and dividends than on research and development in 2022.\nSens. Rand Paul, R-Kentucky, and Mitt Romney, R-Utah, reinforced the points made in the suit, suggesting that senators asking the CEOs what their companies are doing to lower the gap between costs and profits are out of step with the free-enterprise system.\n“The last time I checked, when a buyer and seller negotiate for a price, thats capitalism,” retorted Sen. Maggie Hassan, D-New Hampshire."

    "title": "Cardin and Van Hollen back new foreign aid bill after bipartisan immigration deal dies",
    "content": "THIS STORY HAS BEEN UPDATED\nWASHINGTON  Maryland Democratic Sens. Ben Cardin and Chris Van Hollen have criticized Republican colleagues for blocking the bipartisan package that included border security and military aid to Ukraine.\nNow aid to Ukraine and Israel has new life as senators on Thursday voted 67-32 to advance consideration of the foreign aid package without an immigration component. Cardin and Van Hollen were among the “yes” votes.\n“There is no more important foreign policy priority than getting this bill passed and signed by the President. It is our number one priority for our national security, Cardin said in Senate floor remarks Thursday.\nThe Senate failed on a procedural vote earlier Wednesday to take up the $118 billion supplemental spending bill after Republicans effectively killed the immigration reform measures aimed at addressing the massive influx of people along the U.S.-Mexico border.\nRepublicans had initially refused to consider a Ukraine aid spending bill unless it was tied to immigration reform. That included House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-Louisiana, who had suggested the pairing as far back as a November Fox News interview. This insistence fell away Tuesday when Republican senators declared that the package was “dead” after a negative review by former President Donald Trump.\n“Today, I see some light here. But lets take advantage of this. We have momentum. Lets make sure we get this bill passed,” Cardin told his colleagues Thursday.\nThe supplemental spending measure being considered by the Senate includes $60 billion to support Ukraine, $14 billion for Israel security assistance and $9 billion for humanitarian assistance in Palestinian territory and Ukraine. The package also includes sanctions against individuals involved in dealing fentanyl.\nCardin, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, earlier expressed frustration with Senate Republicans as GOP support for the earlier bill with immigration reforms evaporated.\n“The failure to move this bipartisan funding package forward represents both a dereliction of American leadership on the world stage and a refusal to uphold our responsibilities to secure the integrity of our borders at home,” Cardin said in a statement Wednesday.\nCardin added: “I fear the consequences of deserting our allies abroad and turning our backs on critical immigration reform merely for political exploitation will have real and far-reaching implications.”\nThe European Union announced a $54 billion aid relief package for Ukraine last week, but Cardin said that Europes action wasn’t enough.\nWe need to be on the right side of history and the right side of history to make sure the supplemental is passed with dispatch, Cardin said Thursday.\nVan Hollen said in a post on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, that every time Republicans make new requirements to pass Ukraine funding, “autocrats of the world celebrate”  naming Russia’s Vladimir Putin and China’s Xi Jinping.\n“Theyre eager to see the US back down from the fight for democracy — and most Republicans are apparently happy to oblige,” Van Hollen said in the post.\nThe now-failed Immigration would have given $20 billion to increase the operational needs of the U.S. Border Patrol. The bill’s reform policies included barring illegal border crossings – detaining and deporting those who attempt to cross instead of processing and screening migrants – if they hit an average of 5,000 average crossings a day in a given week.\nThe bill also would have allowed officers to decide asylum cases at the border and increase requirements for asylum. The package was endorsed by the National Border Patrol Council, the union for Border Patrol agents.\nCardin called this border reform “critical” in a Wednesday statement.\nSen. Rick Scott, R-Florida, said in a news conference with other Republican senators Tuesday that he wouldn’t vote on any bill that codified what he called President Joe Biden’s “open border policy” or that would give humanitarian aid money to Gaza.\nScott added that while many in his party want Ukraine to win and Russia to lose, they have different views on if and how funding should be sent.\nHe also pushed for the Republican conference to get together to make a bill that would get passed, claiming that this bipartisan deal was made behind closed doors by leadership.\n“Why dont we start coming together as a conference to get something done?” Scott said.\nThe package was negotiated by Sens. James Lankford, R-Oklahoma, Chris Murphy, D-Connecticut, and Kyrsten Sinema, I-Arizona. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, initially endorsed the bipartisan immigration bill but reversed himself as fellow GOP senators raised objections.\nMany Democrats in both houses said GOP lawmakers who rejected the immigration-foreign aid package were doing the bidding of Trump. Republicans, including Johnson, denied that.\nTrump called the border legislation a “death wish” for Republicans and called for a separate border and immigration bill Monday on Truth Social.\nBut Cardin said Wednesday that the immigration bill collapse “makes clear that there are those in this legislative body who will prioritize fidelity to Donald Trump and his personal interests over the safety and security of our country and the global community.\nThe revived Senate package still faces potential procedural delays and Republican amendments. And it is unclear if the narrow Republican majority in the House will agree to the new legislation stripped of immigration reforms."

If you remove the office of presidency from that violation, then whats left?” Fithian said.\nNan LeClaire-Hirst, a 71-year-old Cape Cod resident with the same activist group  said she has been politically active throughout her life in an effort to protect this democracy as best she can.\n“I am here because I am frightened that Donald Trump will be allowed on the ballot and might possibly again become president of the United States,” LeClaire-Hirst said. “I’m fearful, because I believe that he is a person who wants to be a dictator, and will be.”\nRichard Zipper, a Crofton, Maryland resident, said he doesn’t protest very often, but said that this case was too pivotal to miss.\nZipper held a sign outlining the main points of a paper by constitutional scholar and former U.S. Court of Appeals Judge Michael Luttig, which said that Trump clearly violated the 14th Amendment and that the disqualifications must be carried out.\nZipper said if the Supreme Court were to rule against Trump by upholding Colorado’s action, then he would believe that democracy in the United States is safe.\nZipper said his family members, like other veterans, sacrificed their youth and lives in World War II to protect the Constitution  something he believes could be in danger.\n“I’m hoping the Supreme Court will have one-tenth of that courage to do what is right,” Zipper said.\nWASHINGTON  Demonstrator holds a sign Thursday morning ahead of arguments in Trump v.

(Hailey Closson/Capital News Service)\nBaltimore resident Jacob Blum was among dozens of other people who slept overnight outside the court for the chance to watch the argument in person.\nWhile waiting to hear whether he had a seat  some people had been in line since Tuesday afternoon  Blum spoke about his long history of activism and the complexities of such a case.\nHe said that while he would prefer that the court would rule against Trump, he did worry about the repercussions of such a decision on future elections, that is, where certain some states could try to use similar logic to block President Joe Biden or other candidates from being on their ballots.\n“The court really has to walk a fine line,” Blum said.\nThere were only a couple visible Trump supporters outside of the court before arguments began. Kelli Walk, and her daughter, Rylee Walk, from southern Virginia, spent most of the morning chanting “Innocent until proven guilty,” as they walked through the crowd of reporters and anti-Trump protesters.\n“We showed up to support President Trump, of course,” Kelli Walk said. “We believe them taking him off the ballot is unconstitutional. Their basis is unfounded.”\nWalk said she supports Trump because of his positions on the size of the government, the southern border and the economy.\nWe would like [the justices] to read the Constitution as we do. If it doesn’t go our way, we will have more work to do.” Walk said."

    "title": "Supreme Court justices appear skeptical of Colorado’s effort to ban Trump from the ballot",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  Supreme Court justices were skeptical of Colorados decision to remove former President Donald Trump from the Republican primary ballot during Thursdays oral arguments.\nThe Colorado Supreme Court on Dec. 19 ruled that Trump is disqualified from holding office due to his involvement in the Jan. 6 insurrection, citing Section 3 of the 14th Amendment of the Constitution barring from office those who participate in an insurrection. If the Supreme Court upholds that decision, more states could ban Trumps name from their ballots.\nBut justices nominated by both Republican and Democratic presidents questioned whether a state should have the power to so significantly affect the presidential race.\nThe question that you have to confront is why a single state should decide who gets to be president of the United States, Justice Elena Kagan said. Why should a single state have the ability to make this determination not only for their own citizens but for the rest of the nation?\nJustice Samuel Alito expressed concern that other states could retaliate and exclude other candidates from the ballot.\nI would expect that, you know, a goodly number of states will say, whoever the Democratic candidate is, youre off the ballot, Chief Justice John Roberts said.\nJustice Amy Coney Barrett said striking a national candidate from a ballot “doesn’t seem like a state call.”\nLegal experts and public commentators seemed to agree that the Supreme Court will very likely reverse Colorados ruling.\nThe justices appear poised to kick the can down the road by prohibiting states from disqualifying Donald Trump, said Mark Graber, law professor at the University of Maryland, but leaving open the possibility that Congress could disqualify or pass legislation authorizing states to disqualify. Graber supported Trump’s disqualification in an amicus curiae brief to the Supreme Court.\nJason Murray, the attorney representing the Colorado voters who challenged Trumps name on the ballot, warned the justices said that if the court sides with the former president, that case would be done, but could come back with a vengeance. Congress would have to determine whether Trump is disqualified from office if he wins the November election, he added.\nWhether Trump did participate in an insurrection on Jan. 6 was barely discussed in the hearing. Instead, Trumps lawyer, Jonathan Mitchell, argued that states cant bar insurrectionists from running for president anyway.\nWhen Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson asked Mitchell about it, he said that we never accepted or concededthat this was an insurrection, arguing that there needs to be an organized, concerted effort to overthrow the government through violence.\nSo your point is that a chaotic effort to overthrow the government is not an insurrection? Jackson replied, causing a wave of laughter in the courtroom.\nNone of the criteria were met. This was a riot. It was not an insurrection, Mitchell insisted.\nThe Constitution says that a person cannot hold office after engaging in an insurrection if that person previously has taken an oath to support the Constitution of the United States. Congress, however, can vote to remove the restriction by a vote of two-thirds of each house.\nIn the oral arguments, hearing, the attorneys parties argued whether presidents are covered by this section, and, more specifically, if Trump is. Since he never held any other office, his lawyer Mitchell argued, that he might fall through the cracks, however odd it seems.\nMichael Spivey, a senior lecturer who teaches constitutional law at the University of Maryland, said that the court might decide on legal technicalities without addressing the core issue of Trumps involvement in Jan. 6.\nYou probably wont have people marching in the streets, if you have that decision, Spivey said.\nIm a believer in our country and Im a believer in the Supreme Court, Trump said in a video published shortly after the hearing.\nPresident Trump disqualified himself from holding office, Murray told reporters outside the court after the arguments had concluded, referring to Jan. 6. Thats not something were doing to him. Thats not something any court is doing to him. That is something he did to himself under our Constitution.\nThe Supreme Court is expected to issue a decision before Super Tuesday — March 5 — when Colorado and 14 other states vote. Trump is the clear front-runner for the Republican nomination after winning the Iowa and New Hampshire primaries. In the latest polls, he is more than 55 percentage points ahead of his challenger, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley."

    "title": "Dems and Reps clash over private election administration funding at &#8216;Zuckerbucks&#8217; hearing",
    "content": "WASHINGTON — House Republicans want to pass a federal law banning private aid to the administration of state and local elections, contending that practice they allege unfairly helped Democrats in 2020.\nAhead of the last presidential election, Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg donated $350 million to the Center for Tech and Civic Life for grants to local election departments. \nIn Wisconsin, the Center directed a disproportionate amount of its funding to large cities and “areas of the state that received grants saw statistically significant increases in turnout for Democrats,” Dr. Will Flanders, research director of the Wisconsin Institute for Law  Liberty, a Milwaukee-based conservative law firm, told a hearing Wednesday of the House Administration Committee.\n“Elections are partisan,” said the panel’s chairman, Rep. Bryan Steil, R-Wisconsin, “but elections administrations should never be partisan. The millions of private dollars being funneled to local offices raises serious questions about the conditions placed on their use.”\nThe Center’s grants were largely used by election departments to purchase personal protective equipment like masks, disinfectant, and hand sanitizer as well as to supplement funding for additional employees on election day and purchase educational mailers.\nBut Flanders charged that mobile voting sites funded by Zuckerberg’s group violated Wisconsin a state law prohibiting absentee voting locations that present an advantage to one political party over the other. This claim was upheld in a recent decision issued by a Racine County, Wisconsin, judge.\nFellow witness Mollie Hemmingway, editor-in-chief of conservative online publication The Federalist, mentioned allegations against consultant Michael Spitzer-Rubenstein, who was hired by the city of Green Bay to aid with the 2020 election process after the city’s election department received funding from the Center, abused his access to the city’s election database.\nThese allegations were disputed in a report released by the city in 2021.\nA similar complaint about the organization was filed with the Federal Election Commission in 2021. The FEC subsequently unanimously decided in July 2022 that there was no reason to believe the Zuckerberg group committed any wrongdoing.\nThe Zuckerberg center announced in 2022 that it would no longer be contributing directly to election departments, and unveiled the U.S. Alliance for Election Excellence — “a five-year, $80 million strategy to envision, support, and celebrate excellence in U.S. election administration.”\nSteil vowed to ban what the Republicans dubbed “Zuckerbucks,” and applauded the 27 states that have already passed restrictions or outright bans elections from receiving private donations. The lawmaker backs the “End Zuckerbucks Act,” sponsored by Rep. Claudia Tenny, R-New York, which was reintroduced in March 2023.\nDemocrats on the committee agreed that elections should not be privately funded, but insisted that the answer to cash-strapped election departments lies in more adequate public funding rather than more restrictions. \n“This majority is attacking transparent nonprofit funding for election administration, while doing nothing to stop the flow of billions of dollars of dark money that flood our politics and drown out the voices of everyday American voters,” said Rep. Joe Morelle, D-New York.\nMorelle suggested that philanthropic organizations would have no reason to help fund election commissions if those commissions had “adequate funding” in the first place.\n“(If) states are going to ban private support from local election jurisdictions, then the federal government will likely need to step in to provide additional support,” Dr. Zachary Mohr, associate professor at the University of Kansas School of Public Affairs and Administration, wrote to the committee.\nZuckerberg’s center said in a statement to Capital News Service that the underfunding of election administrations persists.\n“What no one said today is that Congress was asked to allocate $4 billion in funding to support safe and secure elections in 2020, but only gave 10 cents on the dollar for the actual need,” the center said. \n“While the times have changed, the problem has not. Congress has still not stepped forward with predictable federal funding that would support safe, secure and accessible elections for every American voter.”"

    "title": "Senators question loyalty of US consultants withholding subpoenaed information on Saudi work",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  Two Democratic senators on an investigations panel have questioned the loyalty of four major American consulting firms, accusing them of withholding information subpoenaed by Congress regarding those firms’ work for Saudi Arabia.\nSens. Richard Blumenthal, D-Connecticut, and Maggie Hassan, D-New Hampshire, criticized executives of the firms for siding with Saudi Arabia in a hearing held Tuesday by the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee’s permanent subcommittee on investigations.\nThe subcommittee subpoenaed records last August related to services the consultancies provided to Saudi Arabias Public Investment Fund (PIF), which is chaired by Saudi Arabias Crown Prince and Prime Minister Mohammed bin Salman. The subpoena is part of the panel’s inquiry into Saudi Arabias use of soft power and other influence strategies in the United States, Blumenthal, who chairs the subcommittee, wrote in a memo.\nWASHINGTON  Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Connecticut, holds up redacted records the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee’s permanent investigations subcommittee received from U.S. consultancies on their work with Saudi Arabia. (Lisa Woelfl/Capital News Service)\nMcKinsey  Company, Boston Consulting Group, M. Klein  Company and Teneo have not fully complied with the subpoena yet.\nTheir executives, who appeared as witnesses at the hearing, cited Saudi court orders and threats of civil and criminal charges should they produce the documents the subcommittee is asking for.\nMichael Klein, managing partner at M. Klein, said that violating the court order and facing criminal penalties was not a risk I can take for myself or for my employees.\nFrankly, we are between a rock and a hard place, said Bob Sternfels, global managing partner at McKinsey. While the company was contesting the ruling in Saudi Arabia, it did what it could to comply with the subpoena, he added.\nBlumenthal rejected these remarks, saying: You have chosen sides. You have chosen the Saudi side, not the American side.\nHassan said that the firms appear to place (their) loyalties to Saudi Arabia above (their) loyalty to the United States.\nAccording to a written statement the Saudi Public Investment Fund provided to Capital News Service, the committee is requesting information that is confidential and classified. However, the fund said it hopes to work with the subcommittee to resolve these issues.\nBoth PIF the Saudi fund representatives and the consultancies executives argued that they had already provided hundreds of records to the Senate.\nBlumenthal detailed some of the documents the subcommittee received: 40 pages of calendar entries with the meeting attendees names redacted, pages upon pages of press releases, and completely blacked-out contracts.\nCurrently, (the PIF consulting firms are) doing what the Saudi government wants, not what the U.S. government wants, said Ben Freeman, who is the director for Democratizing Foreign Policy at the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft and a research expert on foreign influence.\nThat might certainly change, but based on the information thats currently been provided to the Senate, the firms have chosen to fully cooperate with Saudi Arabia, Freeman said in an e-mail to CNS.\nAs of now, all four consulting companies are still working for the Saudi fund. Blumenthal and Sen. Laphonza Butler, D-California, questioned why the companies would stay in business with a client that threatened their employees.\nThe ranking subcommittee member, Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wisconsin, expressed his sympathy with the consultants.\nHe said that conducting oversight over the Saudi fund was not his priority, but that he still chose to join Blumenthal in calling for full compliance, because any foreign entity wishing to do business in the U.S. must comply with U.S. law and be responsive to congressional subpoenas.\nTeneo Chief Executive Officer Paul Keary and Rich Lesser, global chair at Boston Consulting Group, both called the situation unprecedented.\nNone of the consulting firms leadership indicated that they had any plans to end their business relationship with the Saudis.\nJust one of the firms, Teneo, is currently registered under the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA), which includes a copy of its $4 million contract with the Saudi fund.\nThose who lobby in the United States on behalf of foreign governments or businesses have to register under FARA and regularly provide information to the Department of Justice about the nature of their work and their compensation.\nSternfels said that according to expert counsel, McKinsey does not qualify as a foreign agent under the law, to which Blumenthal responded that FARA needs to be strengthened."

    "title": "Experts urge senators to act in the fight against financial fraud",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  Americans are reporting fewer frauds since a peak in 2021. However, experts at a Thursday Senate hearing said scammers are only getting better at extracting more money from their victims.\n\n\nWitnesses and senators agreed that action is needed to fight this issue  but they differed on what are the best strategies to protect the millions of Americans suffering from the effects of financial fraud.\n\n\nTotal fraud losses reported to the Federal Trade Commission increased from $3.3 billion in 2020 to $8.8 billion in 2022, according to testimony from John Breyault, vice president of public policy, telecommunications, and fraud for the National Consumers League.\n\n\nThis increase is partially due to advancing scam technology, artificial intelligence and a lack of federal regulation on fraud cases.\n\n\n“We are not winning the fight against fraud, and we need Congress to act,” Breyault said during a hearing of the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee.\n\n\nMaryland was fifth in the nation for most fraud reports per capita, according to 2023 Federal Trade Commission data.\n\n\n“This has been an ongoing issue in Maryland as around the country and it takes all forms,” Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Maryland, told the hearing.\n\n\nThe banking panel solicited advice about how to tackle scams and fraud in the banking system.\n\n\nThere are two major types of payment frauds: unauthorized and fraudulently induced transactions, according to Carla Sanchez-Adams, senior attorney for the National Consumer Law Center.\n\n\nUnauthorized transactions happen without the knowledge of the fraud victim. Fraudulently induced transactions occur when the victim of a scam initiates a transaction after being manipulated or deceived by the frauder.\n\n\nUnauthorized electronic funds transfers are protected under the Electronic Funds Transfer Act. However, victims of other payment frauds have little hope of getting their money back. Victims of fraudulently induced frauds  such as a scammer pretending to be a bank  have no clear protections under state or federal law, Sanchez-Adams said.\n\n\nOlder Americans lose the most money from payment frauds, but younger Americans are more often victimized, she said. Some payment systems also target low-income customers and minorities who are often pushed out of the banking system, the senior attorney added.\n\n\nMultiple senators pushed the idea of educating consumers about financial fraud. Sanchez-Adams said there is more to do beyond that.\n\n\n“I think that financial education is extremely important, but it doesnt solve the problem, especially because the scams change overnight,” Sanchez-Adams told the senators.\n\n\nInstead, Sanchez-Adams and the other witnesses urged the adoption of new policies to increase responsibilities for financial institutions and to make federal oversight of common scam tactics possible.\n\n\nPayment platforms should have a larger financial incentive to stop scams before they happen, Breyault said. Sanchez-Adams touted the United Kingdom’s policy under which the victim’s and the wrongdoer’s financial institutions each have to pay half of the reimbursement.\n\n\n“If we did that here and the receiving institution were obligated to pay 50%, you could believe that they would be doing more to prevent their own customers from committing fraud and they should bear the cost because theyre allowing this to happen,” Sanchez-Adams said.\n\n\nSen. Thom Tillis, R-North Carolina, expressed concerns with holding banks accountable. Tillis said he is worried that banks will stop accepting customers who are at a higher risk for falling victim to fraud.\n\n\n“There are a number of times were proposing legislation, like here, that upon the surface looks good, but ultimately underbanks or unbanked people, so weve just got to strike the right balance,” Tillis said.\n\n\nHe urged Congress to give special priority to passing legislation, including the Protecting Consumers from Payments Scams Act, which would protect victims of fraudulently induced payments.\n\n\nCryptocurrency is already or soon will be the “method of choice” for scammers, Breyault said. This is because the currency allows transfers that are anonymous and difficult to trace.\n\n\nThe Digital Asset Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2023, a bill sponsored by Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Massachusetts, would make it easier for financial regulators to track suspicious crypto activity, Warren said at the hearing. Her bill has been cosponsored by 20 senators including Van Hollen and is supported by the National Consumers League.\n\nThese bills are only a few policies being considered by Congress to improve consumer protections."

    "title": "House Republicans advance bill targeting Biden Administration’s student loan forgiveness plan",
    "content": "WASHINGTON   The House Committee on Education and the Workforce has advanced a Republican-sponsored bill that includes measures repealing key aspects of the Biden administration’s plans to make college more affordable.\nThe College Cost Reduction Act, introduced by the panel’s chairwoman, Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-North Carolina, passed on a party-line 22-19 vote.\nThe measure presents numerous programs intended to strengthen the integrity of higher education institutions across the country, but also would gut much of President Joe Biden’s efforts to help students afford college. Democrats on the committee offered a series of amendments to the bill aimed at blocking the GOP repeals, but all were defeated.\n“Unfortunately, President Biden has decided time and time again that the executive branch should also hold the legislative pen,” said Foxx, “Congress has the task of creating laws that reflect the interests of the people. It is not the role of the executive pen.”\nLast August, the Biden administration launched the Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE) program, aiming to cancel debt to borrowers who originally owed $12,000 or less in loans and had repaid at least ten years of those loans.\nThe program is slated to begin in February, with 6.9 million Americans already enrolled, according to the White House.\nBiden’s original plan, as laid out in his 2022 executive order to cancel up to $430 billion in student loans, was blocked by the Supreme Court in a 6-3 decision last June. The court determined that the secretary of education lacked the power to issue debt relief on the scale described in the administration’s plan.\nLast September, Foxx introduced a resolution with Rep. Lisa McClain, R-Michigan, to nullify the SAVE plan, but the full House never voted on it.\nFoxx’s College Cost Reduction Act, introduced in January, would establish a streamlined data system to convey information about colleges, create a performance-based grant program, and hold academic institutions responsible for unpaid student loans.\nIn the committee meeting to consider the bill, Democrats introduced 30 amendments to alter some fundamental aspects of the legislation. \nRep. Bobby Scott, D-Virginia, praised parts of Foxx’s bill, “such as codifying Postsecondary Student Success Grants and eliminating interest capitalization and origination fees on student loans,” but the panel’s ranking Democrat objected to some provisions that he said would make it harder for people to go to college.\nRep. Kathy Manning, D-Michigan, offered an amendment to strike language from the bill repealing Biden administration regulations to protect student borrowers during changes in ownership of academic institutions. \nAnother Biden administration regulation the Foxx bill aims to repeal is the 90-10 rule, which requires for-profit universities to secure at least 10 percent of their funding from non-federal sources. Rep. Mark Takano, D-California, introduced an amendment to strike this section from the final bill but was rebuffed by the GOP majority.\nRep. Ilhan Omar, D-Michigan, offered a motion to remove the bill’s rescission of Biden’s SAVE plan, but that motion was defeated.\n“The new (SAVE) program created by the Biden administration… creates a generous IDR (income-driven repayment) plan that Republicans now want to strip away,” Omar said.\nRep. Suzanne Bonamici, D-Michigan, unsuccessfully tried to amend the bill with language streamlining the process of finding on-campus accommodations for students with disabilities.\nBonamici’s proposal is part of a group of bills unveiled Monday by Democratic members of the education panel referred to collectively as the Roadmap to College Student Success."

    "title": "A government shutdown could halt flood insurance, delaying thousands of home closings",
    "content": "WASHINGTON–– Congress keeps hitting dead ends in attempts to extend a long-term plan for the federal program that provides flooding coverage for homeowners in the country. Unless the National Flood Insurance Program’s renewal happens by its new deadline of Feb. 2, it could lapse.\nThat could mean that about 1,300 closings on home sales per day would be delayed or canceled, according to the National Association of Realtors.\nThe flood insurance program’s Feb. 2 deadline is in the latest stopgap spending measure passed by the Congress and signed by President Joe Biden on Nov. 16. Unless the deeply divided Congress passes another spending bill for the government early next year, portions of the federal government  including the flood insurance program  would shut down.\n“Reauthorizing NFIP ensures that home sales will continue to move forward with the full protection of flood insurance,” Austin Perez, a senior policy representative for the National Association of Realtors, told Capital News Service. “Its about protecting people, property and communities from flooding, the number one natural disaster in the United States.”\nEven though the federal program is not funded by the government, Congress has to reauthorize the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to keep writing flood insurance policies.\nThe NFIP is funded by premiums and fees that policyholders pay. FEMA in April completed a two-year, phased-in change in rates for flood insurance policy holders.  Lawmakers have been clashing over whether the new pricing of premiums across states should reflect the level of risk of every area or if premiums should help subsidize the communities that increasingly are more vulnerable to flooding.\n“Its one of the most important programs for the entire real estate industry,” said Lake Coulson,  the chief lobbyist of the National Association of Home Builders. “Arguably (it’s) the most important insurance program thats out there.”\n \nFEMA’s previously announced pricing makeover for the flood insurance program, known as Risk Rating 2.0, was designed to establish the rates based on the “actuarial” risk of a particular area. In other words, the prices are intended to more accurately reflect how prone a house is to flooding based on its location.\nFEMA’s move addressed sweeping annual losses and debt in the flood insurance program.\nThe NFIP historically has been allowed to borrow money from the Treasury Department to pay claims and later repay the government with interest, according to a report by the Congressional Research Service.\n“However, this changed when Congress increased the level of NFIP borrowing to $20.775 billion to pay claims in the aftermath of the 2005 hurricane season (particularly Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Wilma),” CRS said. “Congress increased the borrowing limit again following Hurricane Sandy to its current limit of $30.425 billion.”\nUnder the new model, policyholders in lower-risk areas would stop subsidizing the people in higher-risk regions.\n“I think flood insurance provided by the taxpayer, subsidized by the taxpayer, shouldnt be for rich people and shouldnt be for their vacation home and beach homes,” Sen. Rand Paul, R-Kentucky, said during a September debate on the Senate floor over the flood insurance program.\n“Were being asked, though, to extend the flood program without any reforms, without any reforms to protect the taxpayers,” he said after describing the NFIP as well-intentioned.\n“The homes in Louisiana that need flood insurance are not mansions,” Sen. John Kennedy, R-Louisiana, responded. “These are homes of working people. These are modest homes being paid for by people who get up every day, go to work, obey the law, pay their taxes, and try to do the right thing by their kids.”\nThe government’s pricing changes mean some homeowners will see a drastic rise in their flood insurance premiums, while others will see smaller increases; some homeowners actually could see premiums drop.\nGregory Baecher, a civil and environmental engineering professor at the University of Maryland who worked on reconstruction plans in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina, used his house in Cape Cod, Massachusetts, as an example of how much higher the new rates are.\n“My current flood insurance is like $1,000 a year so, so doubling means $2,000 a year. I mean a lot of people (in) the country cant afford that,” he said.\nThe program has a rate increase limit of 18% a year. Therefore, it won’t be until 2037 when 95% of current policies will be charged the full rate, according to projections by the Government Accountability Office.\n“Today, we always think of, you know, the billionaires who live on the coast of the barrier islands but in fact, the people most at risk are poor people both white and Black,” Baecher said. “(People) who live in Appalachia and then in the coastal Piedmont. (People) who are subjected to riverine and coastal flooding  principally riverine flooding. And so the idea of NFIP was to protect those people.”\nA dozen states have projected rates that will more than double, according to a study by First Street Foundation. High-risk coastal states like Florida, Louisiana and Mississippi are among them–– and inland states like Kentucky, South Dakota and West Virginia make the list, too.\n“The consequences of the increases in premiums can be seen directly in the decrease in policies in force, which have fallen from a high of 5.7 million policies in 2009 to 4.7 million as of July 2023,”  the report stated.\nFEMA spokesperson Jeremy Edwards said “there are many factors that could influence this drop in policyholders, including the economic impact of the pandemic, inflation, the housing market, affordability or purchasing flood insurance from the private market.”\nTen states –– among them Louisiana, Florida and Virginia–– have sued FEMA to block the overhaul.\n“While the agency (FEMA) paints a picture of nuanced calculations using massive data repositories that reveal a property’s individualized risks, the reality is much simpler: Flood insurance is going to be much more expensive for pretty much everybody,” the lawsuit said.\nIn a motion to deny the request for a preliminary injunction, Justice Department attorneys wrote that the new pricing model “updates the NFIP (National Flood Insurance Program) with up-to-date actuarial methods at a time when the program sorely needs reform.”\n“For the past several decades, the NFIP has been losing billions of dollars because premiums have not accurately reflected flood risk,” the government argued. “Under the legacy (previous) rating approach, taxpayers and policyholders in landlocked states were covering the cost of flood risk in a few coastal states. Risk Rating 2.0 charges every policyholder their fair share based on their property’s true flood risk.”\nAnd before the Congress reauthorizes FEMA to write flood insurance through NFIP, lawmakers need to agree on whether to go along with FEMA’s long-term pricing of premiums or to change the plan in some way.\n“I think you know, sort of one extreme says, we should just make this all actuarially based, make the people who are at risk pay the full risk exposure. And I certainly I think thats a perfectly rational argument,” Baecher said.\n“The other argument,” he continued, “is forget how we got here. Were in this situation now. And we got people who cant afford to pay for the insurance…What are we going to do about it? Are we just going to force them to go without (it)? And then get totally crushed when (a)I  flood comes? Or are we going to try to be compassionate and help them?”\n“To call (the NFIP) imperfect is an understatement,” Kennedy said. “But the only thing worse than having what we have right now is to not have a National Flood Insurance Program at all.”\nIf the government shuts down, NFIP would only have $2.4 billion left for insurance claims.\n“After that no claims will be paid out,” Burchman Insurance Capital, an insurance brokerage firm, stated via LinkedIn.\nA government shutdown that lasts long enough to drain the reserves left in the flood insurance program would put many new homebuyers required to hold flood insurance in difficult situations.\n“You live in Louisiana. You live in Florida. You live in Mississippi, (you need flood insurance),” the home builders’ Coulson said. “But not exclusively, because you could be in Oklahoma, and be on a riverbed that floods after a storm and you need flood insurance.”\n“The expenses that are associated with flood are such that (private insurance companies) would not be able to survive,” he added. “And they cant provide it to the homeowner in an affordable way. So the government steps in.”\nProperty owners can purchase flood insurance through a private company as long as the coverage is as broad as the national flood insurance program’s, according to CRS.\n“NFIP continues to be the largest provider of flood insurance covering about 5 million policyholders across the country,” Perez said. “But there is also a large and growing private market for flood insurance which is often more affordable than NFIP in many parts of the country.”\nWithin Maryland, places like the Eastern Shore are at risk. And the whole perimeter of the Chesapeake is vulnerable as it’s experiencing both geological subsiding––or land sinking–– and rising sea levels, Baecher said.\nAbout 244,992 properties in Maryland have over a 26% chance of being severely impacted by flooding in the next 30 years, according to the online tool Risk Factor.\n.\n“Natural hazards risks are just going to get bigger and bigger and bigger over the coming decades,” Baecher said.  “And we as a federal government, have really got to figure out some compassionate way of dealing with the natural hazard risks.”"

    "title": "One year into Metro’s Silver Line extension, ridership is modest",
    "content": "CHANTILLY, Va.  The Washington Metro Area Transit Authority (WMATA) recently celebrated the one-year anniversary of the opening of the last Silver Line stations in northern Virginia, despite modest ridership numbers.\n“We are thrilled the six new Silver Line stations have had more than 3.4 million trips since we opened last year,” WMATA Media Relations Manager Jason Pascale told Capital News Service.\nThe six new stations expanded the Silver Line from the Wiehle–Reston East Station to Washington Dulles International Airport and on to Ashburn in Loudoun County.\nMany people have been moving into suburban communities on the new line and have direct access to nearby office complexes, Dulles Airport and downtown Washington.\n“We kind of just narrowed it down to one city when we knew where I was going to work,” said 27-year-old Dillon Bull. The systems engineer moved to Reston in March from Washington State with his girlfriend, Johanna Rosenboom, 27, after he accepted a job offer in Chantilly and she took a job as a medical assistant in Fairfax.\n“We kind of just saw Reston as kind of an easy, middle point,” Bull said.\nBull and Rosenboom live in Reston. Bull drives to work, but Rosenboom uses the Metro.\nAccording to WMATA’s ridership data portal, the average number of riders passing through the six new stations over the past year was only 794 people per day. That represents a 68% decrease in ridership compared to when the original five Silver Line stations opened in 2014, with a daily ridership of 2,504 passengers per day.\nAt the Washington Dulles International Airport Station, that number is 1,624 people per day, the busiest of the six new stations.\n“Its actually much less crowded than I would expect, especially since I have colleagues who commute from a similar area and very much dont use the Metro,  Rosenboom said. “My daily commute is relatively uneventful. There is always space for me to sit, its relatively empty.”\nRosenboom thinks the low numbers have to do with lack of accessibility to the stations.\n“Getting from the Metro to my office is not very pedestrian friendly…Theres no signage, theres no clear path, theres an area where theres only one sidewalk on one part of the road,” she said.\nMany of the new stations are located in suburban areas where the only way to access them is by driving and parking in a parking garage, an additional daily cost on top of Metro fares.\n“I dont know that the presence of a Metro is really going to have a huge impact on the communities around it when the existing stations are not well integrated to places,” Rosenboom said.\nExisting stations on the Silver Line with easy access for pedestrians have the highest ridership.\nOf the 11 new stations on the Silver Line opened since 2014, Tysons Station is the busiest, recording 1,728 people per day on average over the past year. The Tysons Corner Center Mall is located at the station and easily accessible to riders.\nWMATA, along with other transit systems in the country, is facing low but rebounding riderships this year as people return to offices as the COVID-19 pandemic subsides. Before the pandemic, average daily ridership on the Metro system was 505,903 trips per day. This year, there were only 289,122 trips per day on average, but that was an improvement from a low of 121,000 in 2021.\nDespite the low overall ridership on Metro, Dulles Airport has seen positive impacts from the opening of the Silver Line.\n“Dulles International Airport has seen more than 1 million trips and airlines have told airport officials they are bringing more flights to IAD because of the direct rail connection,” Pascale said.\nAccording to data from the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority, air travel at Dulles Airport has completely rebounded since the pandemic, averaging 2,016,316 passengers per month for the past year, from a low of 978,353 passengers per month from 2020 to 2021.\nIn its first year since opening, the Dulles Metro station has recorded 582,798 total trips, the highest of the six new stations by far.\n“Its super, super convenient for airport access,” Bull said. “Thats my, like, main perkFrom my apartment to the airport is like 20 minutes total.” His company sends him on trips about 10 times a year, so having easy airport access to the Metro is an asset.\nReaching Dulles from downtown Washington on the Silver Line takes a little over an hour and costs $6.00 during weekday peak fare prices. By car, the trip takes 50 minutes, not including traffic, tolls, taxis, or rideshare rates and parking.\n“Apparently the driving experience to the airport is not super friendly. So having the Metro is incredibly convenient,” Bull said.\nWhile Metro ridership rates are still down, WMATA officials are hopeful for the future.\n“As with any new rail line, we expect ridership will increase as economic growth and new travel patterns develop in the area,” Pascale said. “The Silver Line is a generational investment, and we look forward to serving millions of customers in the years to come.”"

    "title": "In wake of shootings, HBCU advocates urge more security resources",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  After the back-to-back shootings in October at Morgan State University and Bowie State University, advocates for Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) say that underfunding is leading to lack of proper safety and security resources on their campuses.\nTheir concerns have drawn support from Capitol Hill.\nRep. Alma Adams, D-North Carolina, and the founder of the Congressional HBCU Caucus, sent letters to President Joe Biden, Education Secretary Dr. Miguel Cardona and Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, saying there needs to be a “concerted effort to provide funding to HBCUs for them to protect their student body and faculty from violence.”\nShe added that safety and security on HBCU campuses must be a “top priority” and requested that her office meet regularly with the Biden administration to discuss funding and safety concerns.\nOn Oct. 3, five people were injured after a shooting on Morgan State’s campus during homecoming festivities. Just four days later, two people were injured after a shooting on Bowie State’s campus, also during homecoming.\nRyan Coleman, president of the Randallstown NAACP, was on Bowie State’s campus visiting family when the shooting happened. The police presence on campus that night was not sufficient, he said.\n“You saw some police…but it became really obvious that they weren’t walking around the campus…they weren’t patrolling like that,” he said. “There were multiple events on the campus with multiple people. And there just wasn’t any police presence at those individual events.”\nColeman described the scene during the shooting as “chaos.” While sheltering in a dorm with his family, he said he saw people running and trying to get off campus, and that the police didn’t start evacuating campus until about an hour later.\n“The Bowie State University Police were over their heads, it was obvious they did not have the police resources to handle this,” Coleman said. “If there was an active shooter who actually wanted to do harm to students, I have no faith that that person would’ve been stopped at all.”\nAfter the shooting, Bowie State President Aminta Breaux said the school would revisit the idea of adding metal detectors to campus, but emphasized that “no one person has the solution to all the challenges the university faces.”\nBowie State University did not respond to a request for comment about the police presence during the shooting there.\nAt Morgan State, President David K. Wilson announced his plan to extend a fence barrier around campus, saying it will help limit “unfettered pedestrian access.”\nThe school also said it plans to hire more police officers, implement more security cameras around campus and add metal detectors at entrances. The measures will cost millions of dollars and the school said it hopes to receive additional state and federal funding.\nAfter watching the shooting unfold at Morgan State, Coleman wrote a letter to the president of Howard University, where his daughter is enrolled, urging the school to take action during its homecoming celebration in October, including increasing police presence and adding metal detectors at entrances to events, among other precautions.\nAt its homecoming celebration, Howard officials said that safety was their “main priority” ahead of the events, and the school had its campus police and Metro police patrolling campus.\nOn Monday, college officials across Maryland gathered behind closed doors to discuss campus safety in the wake of the Morgan State shooting. They discussed prevention technology on campus, and the importance of doing checks on existing security measures, like security cameras, according to WBAL in Baltimore.\nCampus officials also emphasized the importance of community policing, and that schools should partner with surrounding police departments.\nColeman said that when he has visited the University of Maryland or other non-HBCUs in Maryland, those institutions seem to have the resources they need, whether it’s funding, programming or security on campus.\nMaryland HBCU Advocates spokeswoman Sharon Blake echoed Coleman, saying that underfunding at the institutions is widespread, whether it is in programming, scholarships or security.\n“When you don’t have enough money, you cut corners wherever you can. And that, of course, does include public safety, and that’s unfortunate,” Blake said.\nIn Congress, Adams has passed many bills that supporting HBCUs. Last year, in the wake of bomb threats against HBCU campuses across the country, Adams passed a resolution that condemned violence at HBCUs and reaffirmed Congress’s support for these schools.\nIn 2019, Adams also passed legislation that established two fiscal years’ worth of mandatory funding for minority-serving institutions.\nEarlier this year, the United Negro College Fund (UNCF) proposed legislation that would direct $100 million each year from FEMA’s non-profit grants security program to go towards safety initiatives on HBCU campuses. Adams’ office said she is “strongly in favor” of this proposal.\nIn terms of federal funding, the Biden-Harris administration has invested over $7 million in the nation’s HBCUs, and has directed money in the 2022 and 2023 spending packages, specifically supporting scholarships and grants, as well as institutional development.\nWhile the administration has not specifically increased funding for campus safety in reference to shootings, the Department of Education did secure over $2 million in grants to help schools recover after violent events, such as bomb threats.\nAdditionally, in September, the Biden administration sent letters to the governors of 16 states, including Maryland, asking them to direct more money for their land-grant HBCUs.\nIn the letters, Cardona and Agriculture Secretary Thomas Vilsack said they found that the states’ land-grant HBCUs received a collective $13 billion less than they should have in the last few decades, according to an analysis by the National Center for Education Statistics.\nMaryland’s land-grant HBCU is the University of Maryland Eastern Shore, which the analysis found to have a $321 million funding gap in state appropriations in the last 30 years, compared to the predominantly white land-grant universities in the state, including the University of Maryland College Park.\n“The longstanding and ongoing underinvestment in University of Maryland Eastern Shore disadvantages the students, faculty, and community that the institution serves,” the two secretaries wrote. “It is our hope that we can work together to make this institution whole after decades of being underfunded.”\nThe letter also acknowledges that the state government has been making steps toward addressing the funding gap in recent years.\nIn 2021, then-Gov. Larry Hogan approved legislation giving $577 million to Maryland HBCUs over a decade, which Moore has said he will uphold, according to his office.\nMoore allocated $422 million for all four schools in his first budget, and in February approved $3 million in grants to three schools, including Morgan State and Bowie State. Since Moore took office, funding for Maryland HBCUs has increased over 20%, according to his office.\nMoore’s office said that he “firmly believes that every student deserves to feel safe on campus and that everyone involved needs to work hard to ensure that these tragedies no longer take place in Maryland.”\nBut even the increased funding and support still does not rectify decades of underfunding, Coleman said.\n“Even if (HBCUs) are given some money…they’ve been underfunded for 30 or 40 years, and they’re not really being brought to a whole,” he said."

    "title": "Eagle Harbor activists hope federal aid will help boost environmental restoration",
    "content": "James Crudup has vivid memories of traveling to Seagull Beach in Charles County, Maryland, during his teenage years.\n“I remember that water being just as clear as if we were in Florida…thats the way it was back then,” Crudup said. “Now you cannot see. Now the water is so dark and dirty and is really filthy.”\nFor Crudup, this type of degradation hasn’t just been visible at Seagull Beach.\nAir, water and soil contamination have also made their way across the Patuxent River, touching not only Charles County but also Eagle Harbor, the 70-person town where he served as mayor from 2011 to 2021.\nThe town has seen air pollution and subsequent disproportionate health impacts, increased stormwater runoff and other environmental impacts over many years.\nMost of those impacts, according to Eagle Harbor’s residents, have come from the Chalk Point Generating Station. The plant, formerly owned by NRG Energy, has been owned by GenOn Holdings since 2017. The facility sits on the banks of the Patuxent River in Aquasco, which surrounds Eagle Harbor, and until June 2021, it burned coal.\n“It was a really, really a nasty situation in the air,” Crudup told Capital News Service. “Eagle Harbor has been neglected for so long when it comes to environmental issues. We never had any interaction with the county or the state with regards to trying to improve environmental conditions.”\nProgress on the issues was further complicated by the town’s small size and lack of economic clout compared with other Prince George’s County localities, many of which are wealthy and packed with businesses.\nBut now, with a new federal grant from the Environmental Protection Agency, Eagle Harbor’s activists are hopeful that they can forge ahead with community-led environmental monitoring and restoration.\nThe $370,775 grant will aid Ridge to Reefs, an ecosystem restoration organization, in collecting data on water quality, heavy metals in soil and contaminants in local species like blue crabs. Despite impacts from the Chalk Point plant, not much formal monitoring has been done in Eagle Harbor thus far, according to Paul Sturm, the founder of Ridge to Reefs.\nRidge to Reefs will collect the data through a partnership with Green Mechanics Benefit, an ecological engineering startup based in Prince George’s County. The grant comes from the EPA’s Environmental Justice Collaborative Problem-Solving Cooperative Agreement Program.\n“I think were really anxious to understand the challenges that the community has and then to really try to work together with the community to come up with a blueprint for improving conditions,” Sturm said. “This is an opportunity for a kind of rebirth of this community.”\nThat rebirth has been a long time coming, several Eagle Harbor community members said.\nSilt and sand deposits line the edges of Coleman Creek near Walnut Drive in Eagle Harbor, Maryland. (Photo courtesy of the Town of Eagle Harbor)\nPotomac Electric Power Company opened the Chalk Point power plant in 1964, 35 years after Eagle Harbor became an incorporated town. The plant was the first coal-fired power plant built on a tidal waterway, according to Fred Tutman, the riverkeeper for the Patuxent River.\nTo many of the residents, the plant’s operation represents a fate they’ve been subjected to for too long. Eagle Harbor is a historically Black town, and polluters have capitalized on that, Noah Waters, Eagle Harbor’s current mayor, said.\n“This is quite significant, what’s been going on in this area,” Waters said. “This plant was built in 1964. African Americans in Prince George’s County didnt have political clout to stop anything.”\nIn 2021, GenOn Holdings shut down the plant’s coal-fired units, citing unfavorable economic conditions.\nBut the plant still burns natural gas and oil. According to Waters, there’s a misconception that the coal fired units’ closure remedied environmental issues that the town faced.\n“Its out of sight, out of mind. People think its okay because you obviously dont smell it and you dont see the particulate matter,” Waters said. “But the burning of gas is many times more insidious, because you cant see it and its more detrimental, probably, to the ozone.”\nBurning natural gas yields fewer greenhouse gas emissions than burning coal, according to the Natural Resources Defense Council, but gas has its own hazards, including high emissions of methane, a potent climate pollutant.\nDespite the end of the town’s involvement in coal combustion, pollution has still persisted.\nEagle Harbor is in the 79th percentile for wastewater discharge, according to the EPA’s environmental justice index, which combines environmental and socioeconomic factors.\nColeman Creek, an important natural resource, sits in a forested area in the southern section of the town. But the creek’s role helping to manage stormwater is in limbo after wastewater discharge and runoff from the Chalk Point plant caused the creek to overflow in recent years, Crudup said.\nA representative from NRG Energy did not respond to a request from CNS for comment about the Chalk Point plant.\nEagle Harbor’s 2025 sustainability plan, created when Crudup was in office, outlines several proposals to improve environmental conditions in the town, including stabilizing Coleman Creek’s banks and getting rid of failing septic systems across the town.\nPollution from the plant and from climate change has also impacted the Patuxent River, which the town has also aimed to address in its sustainability plan, with projects for riverbank cleanup and increasing river access for residents.\nAbout 20 years ago, Crudup said, the river saw a buildup of sludge caused by pollution from the coal-fired plant, which made it difficult for boats to pass through and dangerous for people to swim.\nPollution impacts could also be affecting seafood — a central facet of Eagle Harbor’s culture and economic aspirations. Sturm said Ridge to Reefs’ data collection through the grant will aim to pinpoint how contamination in species could affect residents.\n“We want to also understand the concerns for residents in terms of the fish and oysters and crabs and things like that,” he said. “We want to understand what people are eating from that local environment, and then also understand what should be tested.”\nNRG Energy has faced legal action for previous pollution violations at the Chalk Point plant.\nAfter the Patuxent Riverkeeper organization and Maryland Department of the Environment brought a lawsuit in 2016, the energy corporation was ordered to pay $1 million in penalties for exceeding air and water pollution limits between 2010 and 2013. NRG also committed to performing an additional $1 million worth of environmental restoration projects, including improving its wastewater treatment technology.\n“Power plants have a responsibility to keep Maryland’s rivers, skies and lands clean as they strive to provide affordable and reliable energy,” Ben Grumbles, who was Maryland’s environment secretary from 2015 until 2022, said at the time of the settlement.\nBut such legal action hasn’t been enough, according to Eagle Harbor residents.\nAnd often, high-profile environmental successes in the community have led those who have lived in the town for years to feel overlooked and unheard, Tutman said.\n“If theres an environmental success that Sierra Club or (Chesapeake Climate Action Network) or someone takes credit for, that they dont necessarily share credit with the people who actually live there, which I think denigrates and minimizes the voice, the ability and the capacity of people in those areas to speak on their own behalf,” Tutman said.\nTutman said he has often run into people wanting to participate in Eagle Harbor’s environmental restoration without taking time to learn about the town or its residents. It’s important that restoration works stays community-centered, he added.\nRidge to Reefs and Green Mechanics Benefit hope their grant-funded data collection will do just that, Larry Davis, a lead consultant for Green Mechanics, said.\n“We want to make sure that we are engaging with the community in such a way that the community provides a list of items that theyre interested in,” Davis said.\nTo Waters, the upcoming monitoring won’t solve all the palpable issues that Eagle Harbor faces from Chalk Point’s pollution. But he’s excited that it’s a step forward, he said.\nTutman echoed the same sentiment. He’s hopeful that environmental work going forward can preserve the community’s strong ties, he said — both to each other and to the natural resources that have defined their identities.\n“Its very much a community. They pray together, they break bread together,” Tutman said. “I just hope these people retain that organic sense of being connected both to the river and to each other.”"

    "title": "Trone leads fundraising in U.S. Senate race in Maryland, but trails in individual donations",
    "content": "WASHINGTON – U.S. Senate hopeful Angela Alsobrooks has gathered almost 15 times more individual contributions from supporters than her Democratic opponent Rep. David Trone, D-Maryland.\nTrone, who has represented Maryland’s 6th District since 2019, is the top fundraiser in the race to represent Maryland in the Senate, having raised almost $10 million, according to data reported to the Federal Election Commission. But $9.8 million, the bulk of his campaign’s money, comes from his personal funds, the FEC data shows.\nAlsobrooks, who was elected Prince George’s County Executive in 2018, is second to Trone in overall fundraising, having garnered about $3.3 million in funding, according to FEC data.\nBut she has far outpaced Trone in gathering support from individual donors. Approximately $3.1 million of Alsobrooks’ funding comes from individual donors.\n!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r=0;r\nAccording to Gina Ford, communications director for Alsobrooks’ campaign, the candidate broke statewide fundraising records by taking in $1.7 million in the first seven weeks of the race and an additional $1.5 million from July to the end of September.\n“She… continues to spread her people-first message throughout the state, meeting voters where they are,” Ford said in an e-mail to Capital News Service. “Angela remains focused on the everyday kitchen table issues that Marylanders are concerned about.”\nOf the itemized individual contributions that Alsobrooks’ campaign reported, about 34 percent are from Maryland donors, 9.6 percent are from Washington, D.C.-based donors, and about 44 percent of the contributions were donated through ActBlue, a Democratic fundraising platform based in Massachusetts.\nAlsobrooks has not relied on any loans or personal funds, according to FEC data.\nTrone, on the other hand, has only received about $205,220 from individual donors.\nThe trend is not unusual for the businessman-turned-congressman, who holds the record for the largest self-funded campaign for a House seat in history.\nIn 2016, during an unsuccessful campaign to represent Maryland’s 8th District in the U.S. House, Trone spent almost $13 million of his own funds. And in 2018, Trone spent about $12 million of his personal funds on his campaign to win the Democratic nomination for Maryland’s 6th District.\nNathaniel Philp, the press secretary for Trone’s campaign, said the three-term congressman’s inclination to self-fund his campaigns comes from a desire to refuse money from political action committees, lobbyists or corporations.\n“He’s the leading candidate in this race because he only answers the calls of the people of Maryland, and he consistently puts his money where his values are,” Philp told CNS. “We have the resources to share David’s message with every voter statewide, and we’ve built a winning campaign team to make that happen. \"\nTrone is about on par with Alsobrooks in terms of where donations to his campaign are coming from.\nOf itemized individual contributions to Trone’s campaign reported to the FEC, 31 percent are from Maryland and 10.9 percent are from Washington, D.C. Another 37 percent of donations were made through ActBlue.\nSeveral other contributions to Trone’s campaign were also made through political action committee platforms, including those of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee and Swing Left.\nCandidates will report any additional fundraising between the start of September and the end of the year on Jan. 31, when fourth-quarter reports are due to the FEC.\nBoth Democratic contenders have received high-profile support across the state.\nSince the race for the Senate seat launched in May, when Sen. Ben Cardin, D-Maryland, announced plans to retire, Trone has received an endorsement from the state teacher’s union, the Maryland State Education Association. Rep. Dutch Ruppersberger, D-Maryland, also endorsed Trone.\nAlsobrooks earned endorsements from Maryland Gov. Wes Moore, Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Maryland, and other state and national leaders.\nTrone has outspent Alsobrooks by more than eight times, disbursing $9.7 million so far in the race, according to the FEC reports. Alsobrooks has spent $1.2 million.\nThe candidates’ spending habits differ, per FEC data. Payroll and consulting-related expenses have been common for both Trone and Alsobrooks so far — but for Alsobrooks, they’re her top categories. Trone has spent the most on cable television expenses and on digital and media purchases.\nAlsobrooks has spent about $351,300 on payroll, the biggest item in her campaign’s spending.\n!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r=0;r\nTrone has spent about $2.9 million on digital and media purchases combined.

Robin Ficker — who has not officially filed for candidacy, according to the state elections board — has raised $209,601, and registered nurse Lorie R.

Friend has spent $3,220 — more than she has raised.\nArmy veteran Ray Bly of Jessup and retired Air Force Brig. Gen. John Teichert of Crofton have joined Friend in filing for candidacy, but have not reported fundraising or spending records to the FEC.\nMaryland is considered solidly Democratic and has not had a Republican senator since the 1980s."

    "title": "Maryland military facilities probing groundwater for &#8216;forever chemicals&#8217;",
    "content": "WASHINGTON — Maryland military facilities are in the early stages of remedial investigations into “forever chemicals” that jeopardize drinking water supplies in groundwater after a September report by the Department of Defense identified hundreds of military sites across the country as at risk for such chemicals.\nThe facilities include high-profile Joint Base Andrews, home to Air Force One, as well as Aberdeen Proving Ground, Fort Meade, Fort Detrick, Patuxent River Naval Air Station, and the Naval Research Laboratory — Chesapeake Bay Detachment in Calvert County.\nThe potential contamination involves chemicals known as per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS, which are a family of thousands of chemicals used in firefighting foams, heat-resistant products, and many other items.\nThe Pentagon has been under fire for years from communities, environmental organizations, and Congress for failing to recognize the dangers of hazardous chemicals used in military operations and for being slow to clean up facilities.\nThe DOD has initiated remedial investigations at 275 Defense Department and National Guard sites for potential PFAS contamination, 245 of which, including 11 locations at 10 Maryland sites, are close to groundwater aquifers.\nSome of these sites are part of aquifers that serve as primary or secondary drinking water sources.\nRobin Broder, deputy director of Waterkeepers Chesapeake, said PFAS is a known issue around military bases and is more likely to become a human health issue by contaminating water and crops.\nMilitary bases often use firefighting foam in emergencies and training exercises. Foam that still contains PFAS can seep into soil, evaporate into the air or run off into waterways.\nPFAS run-off can also contaminate fish and harm people who eat the contaminated seafood.\nIn 2021, the Maryland Department of the Environment found elevated concentrations of perfluorooctane sulfonic acid, or PFOS, a chemical in the PFAS family, in redbreast sunfish, yellow bullhead catfish, and largemouth bass in Piscataway Creek, a tributary of the Potomac River.\n“Cleanup efforts are challenging and costly,” said Dr. Arthur Daniel Jones III, a professor in Michigan State University’s Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology and associate director of the MSU Center for PFAS Research.\nSuch chemicals are difficult to remove from the environment after contamination and have very few natural processes to break them down, he said.\nPart of the challenge is that…we certainly don’t know very much about how the mixtures of PFAS…are toxic, Jones said. There are PFAS in foods, household productsAlmost every person on the planet is already contaminated by PFAS.\nExposure or consumption of PFAS has other potential health risks, including fertility and immune system issues, developmental delays in children, increased cancer risks, and hormone interference.\nThe Aberdeen Proving Ground, an Army facility, states on its website that tests of its drinking water showed PFAS contaminants below the Environmental Protection Agency’s advisory level of 70 parts per trillion.\n“The Army is committed to ensuring quality drinking water is provided to its soldiers, family members, and civilians,” the website says. “We continue to work with our state and federal partners and will ensure the community is kept updated on the status of our investigation.”\nThe Army site is in the planning stages of the remedial investigation, said Quentin Johnson, Aberdeens director of public affairs.\nSimilarly, Joint Base Andrews emphasized that its drinking water, which comes from the Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission, is unaffected by PFAS.\nAccording to a statement by the Air Force Civil Engineer Center at the Joint Base Andrews Field Office, the extent of PFAS impacts on groundwater at the site is unknown, but groundwater samples have indicated the presence of these chemicals. Further samples are being collected to determine the degree of contamination.\n“This is a slow process complicated by the fact that we are sampling at an active airfield on an active military installation with active missions critical to national security,” the statement said. “At JBA, it takes months to collect samples and get back results.”\nThe Air Force, however, has removed all fire suppression systems that contained PFAS chemicals from the base, according to the statement.\nJoint Base Andrews said it has informed local communities, health departments, and government bodies about the PFAS issue.\nTwo sites at the Naval Research Laboratory — Chesapeake Bay Detachment will be investigated by the Navy’s Environmental Restoration Program for PFAS: a fire testing area and a former firehouse, according to a statement from the Naval Facilities Engineering Systems Command Atlantic.\nThe fire testing area is already under investigation, and the firehouse will be studied in 2024 to “investigate the nature and extent of the PFAS and assess potential human health and ecological risks,” the statement said.\nIn 2018, the Navys off-base water sampling in communities near the Chesapeake lab revealed no perfluorooctanoic acid, also called PFOA (another chemical in the PFAS family), or PFOS levels above the EPA limit of 70 parts per trillion.\n“The Maryland Department of the Environment and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency provide regulatory oversight on the remediation of contamination, whether from PFAS or other contaminants, at military sites within the state,” said Jay Apperson, a representative from the Maryland Department of the Environment.\nThe state, EPA, Navy personnel and community members are actively involved in Restoration Advisory Boards, ensuring that families living near these facilities are informed about environmental issues and the steps being taken to address them.\nRep. Jamie Raskin, D-Maryland, a member of the Congressional PFAS Task Force, emphasized the urgency of addressing PFAS contamination in a recent statement to Capital News Service.\n“I recently joined my colleague Rep. Chrissy Houlahan (D) of Pennsylvania and many others in urging the Department of Defense to swiftly address its growing backlog of military sites contaminated with PFAS,” Raskin said. “We also urged the DoD to adequately fund cleanup efforts at contaminated sites across the country, including the White Oak Naval Surface Warfare Center in my district and several other sites in our state.”\nJones said there aren’t many “good” ways to get rid of PFAS.\nEven if youre drinking water that has very low levels of PFAS in the water, most of what you drink today is going to be with you for years,” he said. “… And there are very few natural processes that break down PFAS, so in essence, that’s why they’re called forever chemicals.”\nOther Maryland sites where PFAS investigations are underway or planned are the Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWC) Carderock Division — Annapolis Detachment, the Naval Surface Warfare Center Indian Head Division, U.S. Naval Electronic Systems in St. Inigoes in St. Mary’s County and the Martin State Air National Guard Base in Middle River."

    "title": "Congress again attempting to address Afghan refugee status",
    "content": "WASHINGTON — More than two years after the final U.S. military withdrawal from Afghanistan, over 70,000 refugees from that nation are living in a legal limbo that Congress has yet to change.\nBut bipartisan legislation, known as the Afghan Adjustment Act (AAA), was introduced in July in the Senate and the House. It would provide Afghans who sought refuge in the United States with a pathway to apply for permanent legal residency.\nAfghan refugees living in the United States currently are under humanitarian parole, a temporary status not equated with permanent residency.\n“Giving our Afghan allies a chance to apply for legal status is the right and necessary thing to do,” stated Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minnesota, and chief sponsor of the Senate bill. “This bipartisan legislation will help provide Afghans who have sacrificed so much for our country with the legal certainty they deserve as they rebuild their lives.”  \nSimilar legislation was introduced in the last session of Congress but stalled over objections from some Republicans.\nThe AAA is not simply an immigration bill,” Eskinder Negash, president and CEO of the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants, said in a statement. “The AAA is essential to fulfilling the United States’ commitments to its national security partners and allies from America’s longest war, which will affect U.S. foreign policy and security in all future conflicts and engagements.”\nUnder the legislation, Afghans on humanitarian status who undergo additional vetting, including an in-person interview, would be allowed to apply for permanent legal status. This is a significant shift from the current law, which primarily offers permanent status through the asylum system or the burdensome Special Immigrant Visa program for those who worked directly with U.S. forces in Afghanistan. The legislation broadens the eligibility for the program to include groups such as the Afghan National Army Special Operations Command and the Female Tactical Teams of Afghanistan.\nThe Senate measure has 13 co-sponsors from both parties, while the House companion bill has 45 Democratic and Republican co-sponsors. Klobuchar last summer tried to get the legislation included in a defense policy bill but was blocked by Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Arkansas. \nEven so, Klobuchar is optimistic about the legislation’s prospects.\n“We’re working on it,” the senator told Capital News Service on Thursday. “We hope to attach it to one of the end-of-the-year bills.”\nSen. Jerry Moran, R-Kansas, and one of the bill’s co-sponsors, told an audience in his home state in October that objections were being addressed in talks about the measure.\n“It’s like every immigration bill in the United States, in Congress,” Moran said, according to Kansas Reflector. “It is picked to death, and nothing seems to happen. The goal is to have this bill completed by the end of the year.” \n“The United States is deeply grateful to the Afghan nationals who risked their lives to advance the U.S. mission in Afghanistan over two decades, said Sen. Van Hollen, D-Maryland, who supports the legislation. Passing the bipartisan Afghan Adjustment Act would demonstrate this gratitude by providing our Afghan allies who have sought refuge in our country with a reliable path to living legally and safely in America.” \nHowever, some GOP lawmakers have raised objections over the Afghan refugee bill because of broader concerns over the state of the U.S. immigration system. \nSen. James Lankford, R-Oklahoma, pointed out the stark increase in overall asylum requests, framing it as a testament to the systems dysfunction. \n“In 2010, we had 21,000 asylum requests for the year across our Southwest border; now we often have that in three days. Its an enormous shift,” Lankford said during an Oct. 1 hearing of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, which was exploring threats to United States. “Our entire immigration system is broken. Theres unanimity about that.”\nSen. Rick Scott, R-Florida, said at the hearing thorough vetting was critical, citing the potential dangers posed by individuals from countries with histories of anti-Semitism and hostility toward the American way of life. \nReferencing data from U.S. Customs and Border Protection, Scott highlighted the significant number of Afghan nationals admitted to the United States. \n“Thats almost 77,000 people from Afghanistan, largely unvetted, as well as 659 from Iran and 538 from Syria,” the senator said. “Remember it took 19 terrorists to do 9/11.”\nVetting also was Cotton’s concern in his move to block Klobuchar from including her bill in a defense policy measure.\n“We should provide (the Afghans) with legal stability and a path to successfully integrate into the U.S., but we can’t cut corners or risk giving green cards to terrorists embedded in the evacuated masses,” Cotton’s office said in a statement.  \nBut Mahdi Rasikh, a former member of the Afghan Parliament and now a parolee, said Afghans have been a positive presence in the United States, emphasizing that many Afghans stood against terrorism for two decades and now deserve the American government’s support.\n“Many Afghan parolees awaiting asylum decisions are facing uncertainty and, as a result, mental health challenges due to the loss of their homes and separation from loved ones who remain in Afghanistan or in unsafe third countries,” Rasikh said. “If the act fails to pass, it risks breeding mistrust among those who assisted foreign troops, including the U.S. government.”\nDaniel Salazar, policy analyst at USCRI, said American officials showed due diligence in vetting Afghans despite the chaotic nature of the evacuation.\n“Afghan parolees overwhelmingly were processed and vetted when they were at the airport in Kabul, vetted and processed further at overseas military bases called lily pads in the initial kind of stages after the evacuation, and then they were processed domestically,” Salazar explained. \nHe added that if there are any worries regarding the thoroughness of the vetting process, the Afghan Adjustment Act offers a solution, which is the requirement for the Afghan parolees to complete a further vetting procedure to transition their status to that of a lawful permanent resident.\nFatema Hosseini, who reports for the Washington Bureau of Capital News Service, formerly was a full-time journalist for more than two-and-a-half years for Kabul Now, a leading Afghan news organization. She was evacuated from Afghanistan during the U.S. military withdrawal from that country, first going to Ukraine and later arriving in the United States on Sept. 11, 2021."

    "title": "Lawmakers propose reforms to Peace Corps amid budget uncertainty",
    "content": "WASHINGTON — For decades, the Peace Corps has been championed as a hallmark of cultural exchange and international service. In recent years, the agency has also faced problems with mental health discrimination, sexual assault and racial bias.\nIn an organization committed to peace and global collaboration, one in three Peace Corps volunteers were sexually assaulted in 2019, according to a USA Today analysis of agency data. And applicants can be turned away due to past mental health care. \nSome critics have called for reforms while also emphasizing the good the Peace Corps continues to provide to people in dozens of nations around the globe. \nSome reforms are included in bipartisan legislation passed by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee last summer. The measure, the first reauthorization of the Peace Corps in more than two decades, includes whistleblower protections to volunteers who report abuse, waste and fraud. The bill also extends the agency’s Sexual Assault Advisory Council until 2028 and requires it to provide annual reports to Congress. \n“The Peace Corps Reauthorization Act is an important step in enacting long-overdue reforms that will improve the safety and security of our Peace Corps volunteers,” Idaho Sen. Jim Risch, the top Republican on the foreign relations panel, said in a statement.\nThe legislation has not yet been passed by the full Senate. \nA companion bill was introduced in the House by Rep. John Garamendi, D-California, and a former Peace Corps volunteer in Ethiopia. The co-chairman of the Congressional Peace Corps Caucus, Garamendi said in a statement: Now more than ever, Congress must support the Peace Corps mission and realize President Kennedys vision of generations of young Americans ready to serve their nation and make the world a better place.”\nOur reauthorization bill does exactly that, and provides much-needed resources to Peace Corps Volunteers, Garamendi said.\nMeanwhile, President Joe Biden’s proposed fiscal 2024 budget included $495 million for the Peace Corps. The GOP-controlled House has passed an appropriations bill cutting the agency’s budget to a pre-pandemic spending level of $410.5 million. The Democratic majority on the Senate Appropriations Committee in July supported boosting the budget by $18 million, from the current level of $430.5 million to $448 million but the full Senate has not yet taken up its appropriations bill. Lawmakers remain at odds over federal spending levels and have had to pass stopgap appropriations bills to keep government operations running while differences are ironed out.\n“I personally love the Peace Corps, and I think it could use a whole makeover in various ways, as many very large bureaucratic agencies could,” Laura DeGrush of Austin, Texas, a former Peace Corps volunteer and former president of the Heart of Texas Peace Corps Association, told Capital News Service. “But its that tricky space between knowing that an agency needs more funding and knowing that they really could use some innovation.”\nDeGrush served in Paraguay from 2007 to 2009. Ten years after her service ended, she created a petition calling for the removal of “discrimination against mental health therapy.” The petition now has over 1,100 signatures.\nDeGrush said she did not personally experience mental health discrimination, but as someone who used to help screen potential Peace Corps volunteers, she experienced frustration in having to turn away volunteers who were fit to serve except for prior therapy or a mental health diagnosis. \nHowever, she said she does believe that if someone was actively a danger to themselves or others, such as if they currently had suicidal thoughts, they would likely not be a good fit for the position. \nKellie Del Signore of Alexandria, VA, a former Peace Corps volunteer who served in Ethiopia from 2018 to 2020, helped create a beekeeping association in a small town during her service which still exists today. \nDel Signore said she experienced catcalling while in larger cities in Ethiopia, although never in the town she was based in, and heard from other volunteers who were sexually assaulted during their service.\nShe said that during her three months of mandatory training before beginning service, the risk of sexual harassment in country was presented to them through scenarios they acted and talked out.\nDel Signore said her cohort of volunteers began as 60 people, and by the end, there were 30; she said most had left due to sexual assault or harassment. After an assault, volunteers often chose not to complete their service or were prevented from doing so by the Peace Corps, according to Del Signore.\nAccording to the Peace Corp’s Management Implication Report published in August, 21% of sampled volunteer sites with a history of serious crimes, including rape, did not comply with required guidance to evaluate crime incidents to assess the safety of sites for volunteers.\n“Ethiopian women also endured this,” Del Signore said. “And technically we get to leave, so thats kind of sad to, like, see our privilege within that.”\nVolunteers of color can experience racial biases both during training and in country. \nIn February, the Peace Corps published an article by four Black volunteers about their experiences volunteering. One volunteer, Kiana Campbell, said she felt pressure to learn the local language quicker than her white counterparts due to being Black and felt ignored in Ugandan spaces where white volunteers were present due to the international perception of what an American looks like.\n“On many occasions, I have been denied the same privileges and leniency that my fellow white Volunteers are afforded from simply being white,” Campbell wrote in the article. \nThe Peace Corps has said it is aware of these concerns raised by volunteers and has made a variety of statements on the issues.\nIn a letter to DeGrush in 2019, Karen Becker, then-acting associate director of the Office of Health Service of the Peace Corps, wrote  that “applicants must have the ability, with or without medical accommodation, to perform the essential functions of a Volunteer for a full tour of duty without unreasonable disruption due to health problems,” which is why the Peace Corps reviews mental health history.\nAdditionally, the Peace Corps has had a Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Program since 2013, which outlines resources and steps to take in the case of a sexual assault. \nThe agency also includes concepts such as diversity, equity, accessibility and differences among cultures in its training for volunteers and offers eight employee resource groups, including for female, Black, Hispanic and Asian volunteers.  \nBiden earlier this year nominated David E. White, Jr., former national security advisor and special assistant to the president, to be deputy director of the Peace Corps. \nOn Oct. 19, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee asked White during his nomination hearing about diversity, sexual assault, mental health and American values in the Peace Corps. \nWhite said that as an Army veteran, he understood the importance of mental health care. He said he believes that effective volunteers must be culturally competent and that volunteers should be diverse in a variety of aspects, such as race and geographic origin. He added that he wants to prioritize volunteer safety and security, including preventing sexual assault.\n“Unfortunately, we know we live in a dangerous world,” White said. “That’s true here at home and it’s true abroad as well. So when the worst does happen, we need to ensure that the response is victim-centered (and) treats victims with dignity and respect.”"

    "title": "Senate panel gives thumbs up to Maryland&#8217;s O&#8217;Malley as next Social Security commissioner",
    "content": "WASHINGTON — The Senate Finance Committee voted 17–10 Tuesday to advance to the full Senate the nomination of former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley to be the next commissioner of the Social Security Administration.\nAll 14 Democrats and three Republicans — Sens. Chuck Grassley of Iowa, Bill Cassidy of Louisiana and Thom Tillis of North Carolina — supported advancing O’Malley’s nomination. Ten other Republicans voted against O’Malley.\n“Gov. O’Malley will demand that there be better customer service at the Social Security Administration,” Sen. Ben Cardin, D-Maryland, told his colleagues before the finance panel’s vote. “We need someone responsible to report to us as to why it takes so long for our constituents to get the services they need from the Social Security Administration. Gov. O’Malley will take that responsibility as the accountable person.”\n\n\nDownload the CNS app from the App Store or Google Play\n\nO’Malley was nominated by President Joe Biden in July to head Social Security after removing Andrew Saul, a holdover from the Trump administration. Saul’s term as commissioner proved controversial for his connection to a conservative think tank, the Manhattan Institute, that calls for cuts to Social Security. Biden’s action drew the ire of Republicans.\n“When the Biden administration removed the last Senate-confirmed commissioner prior to the completion of his six-year term, I expressed strong concerns that this decision politicized the SSA to the detriment of Social Security beneficiaries,” said Idaho Sen. Mike Crapo, the finance committee’s top Republican. “I will not be supporting his (O’Malley’s) nomination today.”\nCrapo noted that Saul did not have sufficient time to implement any reforms before he was removed and that the Biden administration now had set a precedent to shorten the Social Security commissioners term, and that future administrations could do the same.\nThe committee’s chairman, Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Oregon, rejected Crapo’s concerns, saying, “The Supreme Court ruled that single agency heads serve at the pleasure of the president…There is the authority of the president to replace an individual.”\nO’Malley’s nomination now awaits a confirmation vote by the full Senate. If confirmed, O’Malley would head the federal agency for a term ending in January 2025.\nThe Social Security Administration had a budget of $1,3 trillion in fiscal 2022 and had about 60,000 employees. The agency handled benefits for some 70 million people in 2021."

    "title": "Endangered Species Act at 50: wins, losses and controversy",
    "content": "WASHINGTON — Marking its 50th anniversary this year, the federal Endangered Species Act is credited as one of U.S. historys most effective environmental conservation laws. \nCreated to preserve declining species populations and their native ecosystems, the law has reversed the path to extinction for 99% of species under its protection, according to the World Wide Fund for Nature. \nSeventy-three species actually have come off the endangered list because of the law. The dramatic recoveries of the iconic bald eagle and the grizzly bear are perhaps two of the law’s best-known victories.  \nBut the challenge is underscored by 21 species of plants and wildlife newly classified as extinct, which includes 10 birds, eight mussels, two fish and a bat.\n\n\nDownload the CNS app from the App Store or Google Play\n\nIn addition, the Biden administration and Republicans in Congress have been wrangling over whether the law should be strengthened.\nIn June, the administration proposed reinstating so-called blanket protections for threatened species that had been jettisoned in 2019 under President Donald Trump with the backing of industry groups.\n“These proposed revisions reaffirm our commitment to conserving America’s wildlife and ensuring the Endangered Species Act works for both species and people,” U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Director Martha Williams said in a statement.\nHowever, this session, over three dozen bills have been introduced in Congress in what Defenders of Wildlife called “an all-out assault” on the Endangered Species Act.\n“The American public, regardless of party affiliation, overwhelmingly supports the Endangered Species Act and believes it should be fully funded to protect species from extinction,” Jamie Rappaport Clark, president and CEO of Defenders of Wildlife, said in a statement in September. “Congress needs to wake up to this fact and cease their continual attacks.”\nRep. Bruce Westerman, R-Arkansas, has accused the Biden administration of using the Endangered Species Act as “a political battering ram.”\nWesterman, chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee, said: America is home to a rich diversity of species, and we have a responsibility to care for and conserve them well. Unfortunately, the Endangered Species Act is not accomplishing this goal. Radical litigants have completely overtaken this law and weaponized it to line their own pockets, not protect our most sensitive habitats and wildlife.”\nThe Endangered Species Act was signed into law on Dec. 28, 1973, by President Richard Nixon.\n“Nothing is more priceless and more worthy of preservation than the rich array of animal life with which our country has been blessed,” Nixon said.\nThe goal of the law is “to take the necessary conservation measures and actions to recover…species so that at some point, they no longer need the protections of the Endangered Species Act and have recovered,” Angela Somma, chief of the Endangered Species Division at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), told Capital News Service.\nNOAA’s National Marine Fisheries Service and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service are responsible for implementing the Endangered Species Act. \nNOAA oversees most marine species such as corals, seals, whales, sharks and species that migrate between saltwater and freshwater.\nThe Fish and Wildlife Service oversees all freshwater and terrestrial species, including manatees, polar bears, sea otters and sea birds. \nBoth agencies are responsible for species that may overlap jurisdictions, such as Gulf sturgeon, sea turtles and Atlantic salmon.\nOver the past 50 years, many species have been added and removed from the endangered or threatened list. NOAA and the Fish and Wildlife Service currently list 1,344 animal species and 944 plant species as threatened or endangered.\nSuch designations for certain species have upset Republicans in Congress. \nThey passed bills that sought to keep the northern long-eared bat listed as threatened rather than endangered and to block a rule designating one population of the lesser prairie chicken as endangered and another as threatened.\nBiden vetoed both measures. Regarding the bat, the president said the GOP legislation “would undermine America’s proud wildlife conservation traditions and risk extinction of the species.”\nBiden had the same concern regarding the lesser prairie chicken, adding that blocking the rule would “risk the extinction of a once-abundant American bird, and create uncertainty for landowners and industries who have been working for years to forge the durable, locally led conservation strategies that this rule supports.”\nSenate and House Republicans also are sponsoring legislation to reinstate the Trump rules.\n“Abandoning clear and well-functioning Trump-era reforms in favor of a one-size-fits-all mandate from disconnected Washington bureaucrats underscores just how out of touch this administration is with western priorities,” said Sen. Cynthia Lummis, R-Wyoming, principal sponsor of the Senate bill.  \nSomma said that the decision to list a species as “endangered” or “threatened” is based on the “best available scientific and commercial data.” \nUnder the law, a plant or animal species must meet at least one of five criteria to be classified as endangered and threatened. \nThe first criterion is that a species must face a “present or threatened destruction, modification, or curtailment of its habitat or range.” A common example is deforestation, which can directly or indirectly kill species populations by degrading their habitats.\nOver-harvesting or overhunting, as in the case of tigers, for example, is another way species become threatened or endangered. \nDisease or predation is another route to the endangered species list. Millions of bats across North America have died due to “white-nose syndrome.” According to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, six species of bats have seen massive population declines due to the disease.\nA species can also be listed if laws and policies do not slow its decline.\n“Other natural or manmade factors” affecting the survival of a species, such as overpopulation or pollution, can qualify a species for the endangered or threatened list.\nAfter a species is on the list, the federal agencies designate the “critical habitat” for that animal or plant.\n“And those are really important areas that contain the features of habitat that a species needs that are essential to their conservation and recovery,” Somma said. “(The federal agencies are) required to make sure that any action they authorize, undertake or fund does not adversely modify or destroy that critical habitat for endangered species.” \nPlants and animals can get off the list by recovering enough and becoming so numerous they aren’t endangered. Some species are delisted because they ended up on the list in error.\nAnd, sadly and obviously, extinction removes a species from the list.\nSince its inception, the endangered and threatened species list has had 117 species delisted. In the past 50 years, 32 species were delisted due to extinction.\nBut proving extinction is harder than it seems. \nTypically, scientists look for species that are extirpated.\nDr. Dave Secor, a professor at the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science’s Chesapeake Biological Laboratory, explained: “The populations live in different areas and so a species has a broad range. But there may be many different reproducing populations within that range of species. If it goes extinct that means that all the populations are extirpated.”\nHe added that true extinction, meaning no individuals were left within that species, is rare unless a global threat occurs. So more often than not, it is easier for scientists to claim species are extirpated in certain areas rather than absolutely extinct.\n“Extinction is forever,” said Matt Ashton, the Freshwater Mussel Assessment Project leader at the Maryland Department of Natural Resources. “And a lot of times you might need several decades of evidence to be built before you can really declare something truly extirpated or extinct. Just because you cant search everywhere.”\nHe researches Maryland mussel populations, their size and structure and how viable they are. There are 16 species of mussels found in Maryland and 14 of them are considered rare, threatened or endangered, according to the Maryland Department of Natural Resources.\nFor small species like the dwarf wedgemussel, one of the greatest challenges in crafting a conservation strategy is getting an accurate read of how many individuals are left in a population, Ashton said.\nDwarf wedgemussels, which are listed as endangered, were one the first mussel species to have an official recovery plan, he said. They are so small that they can be washed away very easily and tend to spend most of their time buried at the bottom of rivers.\n“It makes them very difficult to find,” Ashton said. “So were literally, when we do work on them, were literally searching for kind of needles in haystacks in a river.”"

    "title": "Vogel leads in fundraising, spending in Maryland’s US House 6th District race",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  Maryland Del. Joe Vogel, D-Montgomery, has raised and spent the most money out of all candidates vying to represent the state’s 6th District in the House.\nVogel has raised $252,813, putting him above his fellow Democrats — and also above all Republicans running for the seat. Currently representing District 17 in the Maryland House of Delegates, Vogel has not officially filed for candidacy, according to the Maryland State Board of Elections website, but announced his congressional campaign in May.\nNavy veteran and political newcomer Tom Royals leads Republicans in funds raised, with $160,383.\n\n\nDownload the CNS app from the App Store or Google Play\n\nThe district is rated as a “likely Democratic” seat by Sabato’s Crystal Ball at the University of Virginia’s nonpartisan Center for Politics.\nSince announcing his campaign in July, Royals has adopted hard-right talking points, campaigning for parental rights and against children being “indoctrinated.” Royals officially filed for candidacy with the state election board last month.\nSlightly under a year from the 2024 general election, the candidates are part of a field where four Democrats, four Republicans and one independent have officially filed to run for the 6th District seat. Democratic incumbent Rep. David Trone is running for the Senate in a crowded race to succeed retiring Sen. Ben Cardin, D-Maryland.\nOf 582 itemized donations to Vogel’s campaign, only 6.8% are from donors in Maryland, according to records on file with the Federal Election Commission. Almost half of Vogel’s donations are from small-dollar donors who donate via ActBlue, a Massachusetts-based online fundraising platform used by almost every Democratic candidate.\nIf elected, 26-year-old Vogel would become one of the first Generation Z individuals in Congress.\n“He’s doing sort of the nitty gritty but necessary work of going everywhere, talking to everybody and doing what it takes to fundraise,” Vogel’s campaign manager, Oren Adam, told Capital News Service.\nAdam added that Vogel’s campaign has prioritized meeting voters where they are to build a “robust fundraising operation” with a “broad, multi-generational approach.”\nRepublican Royals has garnered more support from in-state donors than Vogel, with about 46% of money raised coming from Maryland contributors, according to FEC records.\nRoyals also has seen some financial support from PACs — namely WinRed, ActBlue’s Republican counterpart. But only 8% of Royals’s contributions come from WinRed.\nAmericans and Maryland families are “increasingly rallying behind Tom’s campaign,” Royals’s campaign manager Brendan Duffy said in an e-mail to CNS.\n“After raising nearly double the rest of the GOP field combined last quarter… Royals is clearly the only Republican candidate who can raise the resources and inspire the base of grassroots support required to win this critical race that may determine which party controls the U.S. House next fall,” Duffy said.\n!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r=0;r\n!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r=0;r\nBesides Vogel, Democratic candidates include Army veteran Geoffrey Grammer, environmentalist and political newcomer George Gluck, former gubernatorial candidate Ashwani Jain and businessman Stephen R. McDow.\nLike Vogel, several other Democrats have announced campaigns and begun raising money but have not formally filed with the state elections board: Hagerstown Mayor Tekesha Martinez, state Del. Lesley Lopez, State Department employee Joel Rubin, Montgomery County Council Member Laurie-Anne Sayles, former federal government employee Destiny Drake West and former Commerce Department Deputy Assistant Secretary April McLain Delaney, wife of former Rep. John Delaney, who held the 6th District seat from 2013 to 2019.\nIn addition to Royals, Republicans who have filed include Army veteran Chris Hyser, former Senate candidate Todd A. Puglisi and Air Force veteran Mariela Roca.\nRepeat 6th District candidate and former Del. Neil Parrott, former Del. Brenda Thiam, Woodsboro Mayor Heath Barnes and former gubernatorial candidate Dan Cox have announced campaigns for the GOP nomination but have not formally filed.\nIndependent Jason Johnson will be on the ballot for the 6th District seat only for the November 2024 general election because independents cannot run in Maryland's closed primaries.\nThe deadline to file for candidacy for Democrats and Republicans is Feb. 9, 2024. Independents must file by July 1, 2024.\nAmong the field of Democratic candidates for the 6th District, Grammer is closest to Vogel in fundraising, with $238,982. But less than $20,000 of Grammer’s contributions are from individuals. Almost $220,000 of his total funding comes from loans.\nGrammer is the only Democrat whose fundraising includes loans.\nBut two Republicans — Hyser and Thiam — have both raised over $10,000 through loans.\nOf those vying for the seat so far, three candidates have previously sought to represent 6th District.\nRoca ran in and lost the 2022 Republican primary. Gluck ran independently in 2020 and earned less than 2% of the vote, and then ran in and lost the Democratic primary in 2022.\nParrott was the Republican nominee for the seat in 2020 and 2022, but lost to Trone in solidly-blue Maryland during both elections.\nThe Hagerstown Herald-Mail reported in 2022 that Parrott received more individual contributions from donors, but Trone — whose campaign was self-funded — outspent him.\nThis year, Parrott represents a spending anomaly as the only candidate who has spent more money than he has raised. Contributions to Parrott’s campaign totaled $33,242, putting him in fourth place among Republicans for fundraising, but the candidate has spent $57,084.\nParrott did not respond to a CNS request for comment.\nBut Parrott’s spending is only slightly more than half of Vogel’s, who also leads the field of candidates in spending, with $93,374 in disbursements so far.\nGrammer has spent the second-most among Democratic candidates at $83,988.\nRoca leads Republicans in spending — despite not having raised the most money — and Royals ranks second. Roca has spent $85,889 and Royals has spent $57,846."

    "title": "Lawmakers try again to set a vote on Puerto Rico’s status",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  A coalition of senators, House members and prominent Puerto Rican politicians is pressing Congress to pass legislation that would set a vote on the future of the island territory. \n“It’s been more than 100 years since Puerto Rican residents became U.S. citizens … well over 300,000 Puerto Ricans have served in our nations military,” Sen. Martin Heinrich, D-New Mexico, sponsor of the Senate bill, said last week. “I think we should all agree that Americans living in Puerto Rico deserve an overdue permanent and democratic answer on their political status.”\nThe Puerto Rico Status Act authorizes the island territory of over 3 million residents to hold a federally-binding referendum to choose among three options: statehood, independence, or sovereignty in free association with the United States. \n\n\nDownload the CNS app from the App Store or Google Play\n\nHeinrich’s bill is companion legislation to a House bill introduced in April by Rep. Raúl Grijalva, D-Arizona, Rep. Steny Hoyer, D-Maryland, and Resident Commissioner Jenniffer González-Colón, R-Puerto Rico.\nWASHINGTON  Sen. Martin Heinrich, D-New Mexico, speaks at a Nov. 8 press conference about his bill that would set a vote on the future of Puerto Rico. Sen. Brian Schatz, D-Hawaii, is on the right, and Puerto Rico Gov. Pedro Pierluisi is on the left. (Ryan Mercado/Capital News Service)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“For far too long, the people of Puerto Rico have been deprived of the self-determination that they and all people deserve,” Hoyer told Capital News Service. “We owe it to Puerto Ricans to bring an end to their islands 124-year-old status as a U.S. territory and to grant them control over their islands political future.” \nAs House majority leader, Hoyer brought a bill to the House floor in December 2022 to set a status vote for Puerto Rico, it passed the House but was not considered by the Senate.\n“I remain committed to working with Puerto Rico’s elected officials and community leaders to ensure that the people of Puerto Rico have full autonomy and democratic control over their status,” Hoyer said.\nSen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Maryland, is among 21 other senators co-sponsoring the Senate measure. \n“The United States is grounded in the principle that every citizen has the right to self-determination and representation in government,” Van Hollen told CNS. “While we are always working to reach this ideal, one way we continue to fall short is in denying the people of Puerto Rico these core American rights.”\nPuerto Rico has been an American territory since 1898 when the United States acquired the island during the Spanish-American War. \nThe island’s residents are U.S. citizens but do not enjoy some of the same rights as residents of the 50 states, such as voting for president. Puerto Ricos resident commissioner serves in the House but does not have voting powers.\nCritics say the territorial status has often resulted in Puerto Rico not receiving ample attention or much needed aid when natural disasters strike, most notably when Hurricane Maria struck the island in 2017.\n“When I go to some parts of Puerto Rico that are without power in the wake of natural disasters, I say if this happened in Connecticut, thered be riots in the streets,” said Sen. Richard Blumenthal D-Connecticut. “It is unfair and unjust for the people of Puerto Rico to be treated as second-class citizens. Colonial status must end.”\nThe latest congressional effort to get a vote on Puerto Rico’s status faces strong headwinds: nine previous bills and resolutions dating back to 1998 previously failed.\nPuerto Ricans have voted in six referendums since 1967 on the issue of their political status. The past three referendums in 2012, 2017, and 2020 showed a majority support statehood, but the issue faces partisan roadblocks in Congress, which ultimately decides if the island can become a state. \nWhen the issue was voted on in the House in December of last year, the vote was 233-191. All Democrats but only 16 Republicans voted in favor of allowing Puerto Rico to vote on its future. The bill died as a new Congress was sworn in a month later. \nIn the first 70 years of American independence, debates on admitting new states to the Union revolved around whether they would be slave states or free states. Today, that debate is focused on whether a new state would be a Democratic or Republican state and send delegations representing those parties which could flip the balance of power in the House or Senate or both.\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, said in 2020 that statehood for Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia was part of the Democrats’ “radical” agenda. McConnell and other Republicans believe admission of the two would send four Democratic senators to Washington, giving the Democratic Party a powerful advantage in the closely divided Senate.  \nSenators at last week’s press conference rejected that argument.\n“Oftentimes when states come in and everyone assumes they are always going to be Republican or they are always going to be Democrat and then the voters prove themselves to be independent,” Heinrich said. “We’ve seen that with Hawaii, we’ve seen that with Alaska and I think this is about being true to the will of the people.” \nThe senator acknowledged that the path from territory to state can be arduous.\n“It took us 50 New Mexico statehood bills to get there  many, many decades before we finally became the 47th state of the United States,” Heinrich said. \nSome senators said they had constituents deeply interested in the future of Puerto Rico.\n“We are home to more than 288,000 Connecticut residents of Puerto Rican descent, the highest density of Puerto Rican heritage anywhere in the country,” said Sen. Chris Murphy D-Connecticut.\nThe sponsors see the legislation as the best attempt yet to bring the issue of Puerto Rico’s future to a resolution. \n“This bill is a compromise between members of the House that sit on different sides of the question of final status, but who agree that now is the time to make that decision,” Murphy said. \nPuerto Rico Gov. Pedro Pierluisi said the 22 senators on the bill was “the highest number of original co-sponsors in history.”\n“That bodes well for our fight for equality,” said the governor, who faces a challenge from González-Colón in next year’s Progressive New Party gubernatorial primary. The PNP is pro-statehood.  \nBesides Hoyer, cosponsors on the House Puerto Rico bill include Maryland Democratic Reps. David Trone, Jamie Raskin and John Sarbanes."

    "title": "Election takeaway: abortion remains a potent issue for voters",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  Tuesday’s elections brought multiple victories for reproductive rights advocates, a strong sign that abortion access will be a durable issue and a motivating factor for many voters in 2024.\n“In case it wasn’t already blindingly obvious before, the abortion issue in a post-Dobbs political environment continues to be a significant advantage for Democrats,” Kyle Kondik and J. Miles Coleman wrote Wednesday in Sabato’s Crystal Ball, a nonpartisan website at the University of Virginia’s Center for Politics.\nOhio passed a ballot measure enshrining reproductive rights in the state constitution, and Democrats in Virginia retained control in the state Senate and flipped party control of the House of Delegates.\n\n\nDownload the CNS app from the App Store or Google Play\n\nIn Kentucky, Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear won re-election after making support of abortion rights a key message of his campaign. And in Pennsylvania, Dan McCaffery, a Democrat who campaigned on abortion rights won a seat on the Pennsylvania Supreme Court.\nAt the center of all these races was the Supreme Court’s decision last year in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, in which a majority of justices ruled that the Constitution does not guarantee a right to an abortion. The ruling effectively overturned the landmark 1973 decision in Roe v. Wade in which the right to an abortion was protected.\n“Abortion access is still a salient message a year and a half after the Dobbs decision, and demonstrating that while voters may be dissatisfied with the direction of the country and its Democratic leader, they’re still hesitant to put Republicans in charge instead,” said Jacob Rubashkin, an analyst with Inside Elections.\nPolling shows Americans largely support access to abortion.\nA Gallup poll in July found only 13% of Americans thought abortion should be illegal in all circumstances; 69% said abortion should be legal in the first trimester, although support dropped to 37% for the second trimester and 22% for the third. The poll found that 61% of Americans disagreed with the Supreme Courts decision to overturn Roe v. Wade.\n“Abortion access isn’t just a winning issue with voters; it’s a fundamental right that impacts every aspect of their lives,” Mini Timmaraju, president and CEO of Reproductive Freedom For All, said in a statement. “Ohioans have now constitutionally guaranteed this right, and the nation is watching.”\nOhioans voted in favor of Issue 1, a ballot measure that would change the Ohio Constitution to include protection for abortion access. The amendment states that “every individual has a right to make and carry out one’s own reproductive decisions.” It also states that “the State shall not, directly or indirectly, burden, penalize, prohibit, interfere with, or discriminate” against those seeking abortions or those performing them. Abortions may be prohibited once a fetal is viable, generally considered between 22 and 24 weeks of pregnancy.\nOhio Sen. J.D. Vance, a Republican, said on X that his party needed to evaluate how its candidates will argue against reproductive rights in 2024.\n“We need to understand why we lost this battle so we can win the war,” Vance said in an X post. “We have to recognize how much voters mistrust us on this issue. Weve fallen behind on the moral argument. Im talking about sustained, years-long efforts to show the heart of the pro life movement.”\nIn an appearance Wednesday on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe,” Ohio’s other senator, Democrat Sherrod Brown, praised the grassroots efforts to pass Issue 1 in his state.\n“People understand that a national abortion ban takes their rights away, maybe forever, and thats why people worked so hard last night,” Brown said.\nBrown has held his seat since 2007 and is up for reelection next year. He said the vote on Tuesday proves that abortion will be a critical issue in the race.\n“The three Republicans running in the primary next year to be the nominee against me, all three of them have called for a national abortion ban. So they are so out of step with Ohio voters,” Brown said.\nVirginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, a Republican, said before balloting Tuesday that if the GOP won the majority in both houses of the state legislature, the state would “lead” by enacting a 15-week ban, with exceptions. The current law bans abortion after 26 weeks.\n“I think this is what Virginians expect. I think they know that in a state that is so purple, that we do debate. We do argue,” Youngkin told reporters Wednesday. “But they expect us to find common ground on these most important topics and to press forward.”\nIn Wednesday’s Republican presidential debate, the candidates  all opposed to abortion  disagreed on the path forward for the GOP in handling the issue.\nBusinessman Vivek Ramaswamy, who is from Ohio, said he was upset about the votes on Tuesday and said the Republican Party was a “party of losers.” Florida Gov. Ron Desantis said Tuesday’s results caught the party “flatfooted.”\nFormer New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie said abortion rights should be decided state by state and argued that the bigger issue is that “we’re not pro-life for the whole life,” advocating for funding drug addiction rehabilitation.\nSouth Carolina Sen. Tim Scott was not ready to concede any ground, criticizing states that have passed legislation affirming abortion rights and calling for a nation-wide 15-week limit to stop “reckless behavior” in states that have affirmed abortion rights, such as Kansas, California, New York, and now Ohio.\nFormer United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley said she would support any abortion ban that can get the votes to pass.\nDemocrats clearly are embracing reproductive rights one year out from the general election.\n“Ohioans and voters across the country rejected attempts by MAGA Republican elected officials to impose extreme abortion bans that put the health and lives of women in jeopardy, force women to travel hundreds of miles for care, and threaten to criminalize doctors and nurses for providing the health care that their patients need and that they are trained to provide,” President Joe Biden said in a statement. “This extreme and dangerous agenda is out-of-step with the vast majority of Americans.”\n“While President Biden and I are working to protect reproductive freedom, extremists are pushing for a national abortion ban that would criminalize reproductive health care in every single state in our Nation,” Vice President Kamala Harris said in a statement. “It is past time for Congress to listen to the American people and pass a bill that restores the protections of Roe v. Wade. And when they do, President Biden will sign it into law.”"

    "title": "FBI headquarters move to Maryland faces new headwinds from agency and Congress",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  The Biden administration’s announcement that the new FBI headquarters would be constructed in Greenbelt, Maryland, was met Thursday with criticism from the agency’s director and allegations of corruption in the selection process from Virginia lawmakers.\nOn Capitol Hill, a spending measure that would be a vehicle for helping to pay for the new FBI headquarters was pulled from the House floor, part of a broader battle among lawmakers ahead of a looming Nov. 17 government shutdown.\nThe latest developments suggest that the years-long debate over the location of the new FBI headquarters seems to be continuing, notwithstanding Wednesday’s announcement by the General Services Administration.\nFBI Director Christopher Wray said there was a “potential conflict of interest” in the agency headquarters decision, writing in an internal email Thursday to FBI employees, according to multiple media sources. Wray said he believed one senior GSA executive may have acted in favor of Greenbelt’s selection.\n\n\nDownload the CNS app from the App Store or Google Play\n\nWray said the FBI has concerns about fairness and transparency in the process and GSAs failure to adhere to its own site selection plan.\n“Despite our engagement with GSA over the last two months on these issues, our concerns about the process remain unresolved, Wray wrote.\n!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r=0;r\nSenator Mark Warner, D-Virginia, said on a call with reporters that Virginia lawmakers will be calling for a Department of Justice inspector general’s review due to alleged “corruption” in the selection process.\n“The fact that you've got three career professionals, two representing GSA and one representing the FBI, coming together even with the new criteria and still choosing Virginia only to have that overwritten by a political appointee is outrageous,” Warner said. “This is the kind of behavior I expected from the Trump administration, but I think we all expect better from the current administration.”\nRep. Gerry Connolly, D-Virginia, whose district includes the rejected Springfield site for the headquarters, said in a statement that the “GSA has shamelessly caved to political pressure,” and that the agency did not warn lawmakers in advance about the decision.\n\nREAD MORE:\n‘No more deliberation, there’s no more questioning:’ Maryland leaders defend FBI relocation\n\nAmidst these allegations, Maryland’s state and federal officials hailed the move.\n“This is a historic moment for the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and our nation,” said a joint statement from the officials, who dubbed themselves “Team Maryland.” “For decades, the dilapidated J. Edgar Hoover Building has failed to meet the FBI’s operational needs, which has undermined our national security. The once-fabled building has crumbled before our eyes, with nets surrounding the facility for years to protect pedestrians from falling debris.”\nThe 61 acres in Greenbelt emerged as the preferred location due to its proximity to multiple transportation networks, including Metro, and other federal facilities, the ease of developing the now-vacant site and the desirability of promoting equity, according to the GSA. Greenbelt had the highest score for all the mentioned criteria compared to the other two sites, the GSA said.\n\nREAD MORE:\nMaryland officials delight in announced FBI move to Greenbelt\n\nGreenbelt also represents the lowest cost to taxpayers, with an estimated cost of $26.2 million for site acquisition and preparation, GSA said. That compared to over $100 million for a site in Landover, Maryland, and $64 million for the Springfield site.\nPresident Joe Biden in March issued his fiscal 2024 budget plan under which $3.5 billion would come from a proposed Federal Capital Revolving Fund, and $645 million from earlier appropriations for the GSA.\nIn addition to moving about 7,500 people from the FBI’s headquarters to Greenbelt, the GSA is planning to keep up to 1,000 FBI employees in a federal facility in downtown Washington.\nBut prospects for funding the FBI headquarters move are hazy at the moment. That is because Congress is deadlocked over spending bills, even as a current stopgap funding bill expires on Nov. 17.\nOn Wednesday evening, after the FBI move was made public, Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Florida, proposed an amendment to an appropriations bill to block the move.\nWhile the amendment to the financial services and general government spending bill failed, the FBI headquarters decision was one of the reasons House Republican leaders pulled the overall bill from the floor, Roll Call reported.\nThe establishment of the FBI headquarters is poised to bring significant economic benefits to the region, including job creation and infrastructure improvements, local, state and federal officials said.\n“After a long push from Team Maryland, the FBI Headquarters is officially coming to Prince George's County!” Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Maryland, tweeted. “This is the right decision - it’s a win for the FBI’s mission, for taxpayers, and for our goal of ensuring federal investments advance equity in our communities.”"

    "title": "Lawmakers take aim at social media disinformation",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  Reps. Josh Gottheimer, D-New Jersey, and Don Bacon, R-Nebraska, on Wednesday unveiled legislation to combat disinformation on TikTok and other social media platforms that has surged during the war between Israel and Hamas.\n“This legislation will require social media companies to release detailed reports of violations to their terms and services and how they’re addressing these violations, which includes using their platforms for terrorist purposes,” Gottheimer told reporters during a press conference call. “It also requires the intelligence community to provide a threat assessment about what’s happening on social media.”\nThe proposal is called the Stopping Terrorists Online Presence and Holding Accountable Tech Entities Act, or the Stop Hate Act.\nGottheimer said the measure includes a $5 million fine for each day a social media company fails to comply with the requirements of the bill.\nAdditionally, the lawmakers wrote to Attorney General Merrick Garland, urging him to require TikTok to register as a foreign agent under the Foreign Agents Registration Act.\nRep. Mike Gallagher, R-Wisconsin, chairman of the Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party, said TikTok fosters hatred, particularly antisemitism.\n\n\nDownload the CNS app from the App Store or Google Play\n\n“We have a growing mountain of evidence that this type of censorship, this type of misinformation is being propagated on TikTok,” Gallagher said.\nGottheimer said this disinformation is also seen on Al Jazeera, Facebook and X, formerly known as Twitter, and is fueling the rise of antisemitism and Isamaphobia in recent weeks.\nTikTok is a particular concern among lawmakers because it is highly influential with younger viewers and because it is owned by the Chinese Communist Party.\nMany Americans support tech companies intervening to block disinformation, according to a 2023 survey.\n!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r=0;r\nSome U.S. jurisdictions have barred TikTok.\nChina has had an anti-Israel stance since the Oct. 7 attacks by Hamas, according to Gottheimer, and is using TikTok to boost anti-Israel and pro-Hamas videos in the United States.\nHowever, TikTok has said it has been blocking misinformation.\n“Since Oct. 7, we've removed over 775,000 videos and closed over 14,000 livestreams promoting violence, terrorism, hate speech, misinformation, and other violations of our Community Guidelines in the impacted region,” the platform said last month.\nBacon said he and his colleagues are also asking intelligence agencies to provide summaries of how terrorists are using social media. He said such information could help them “learn and keep improving our policy.”\nThe Stop Hate Act has the backing of the Anti-Defamation League.\nJonathan Greenblatt, the league’s chief executive officer, said ADL’s Center of Extremism reported 619 antisemitic acts between Oct. 7 and Nov. 6, most of which have been related to the war in Israel. He said in that same period in 2022, there were 166 antisemitic acts reported.\nWhile social media companies have posted about trying to limit extremist content, Greenblatt said their tools and policies are way behind what they should be doing.\n“We are not asking for anything special here,” he said. “We’re simply asking for these companies to play by the same rules that every other business in America abides by – to be transparent and have accurate reporting.”"

    "title": "Senate foreign relations panel indicates support for more Ukraine aid",
    "content": "WASHINGTON – The Senate Foreign Relations Committee Wednesday showed bipartisan support for a Biden administration request for supplemental funding to aid Ukraine’s war against Russia.\nThe committee’s chairman, Sen. Ben Cardin, D-Maryland, said passing the $64.1 billion funding request will “put the United States on the right side of history.”\nCardin called the U.S. support for Ukraine “vitally important,” adding that he was optimistic about the request getting passed, though not necessarily before a Nov. 17 deadline.\nCardin said not including aid for Ukraine in a continuing resolution that avoided a government shutdown “sent a terrible message to the international community.”\nWASHINGTON  Sen. Ben Cardin, D-Maryland, chairs Wednesdays Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing on additional aid to Ukraine. (Minnie Stephenson/Capital News Service)\nRight after the continuing resolution was passed on Sept. 30, Cardin said he and his colleagues made phone calls to Ukrainians to “let them know that they were not forgotten.”\nSen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Maryland, agreed that failure to pass supplemental funding would once again send a bad message, as well as lead to cracks in the NATO alliance. He said that there is an “urgent need to continue to support our Ukrainian friends.”\nJames O’Brien, assistant secretary of European and Eurasian affairs in the State Department, told the committee in a hearing that the new spending request would let Ukraine put all of its tax dollars toward the war.\n\n\nDownload the CNS app from the App Store or Google Play\n\nCurrently, Ukraine is paying for about 60% of the war, according to O’Brien.\nThe country also is spending a significant portion of its budget to support first responders, healthcare professionals and educators, said Erin McKee, assistant USAID administrator for Europe and Eurasia, adding that a delay in supplemental funding would severely weaken these essential services.\nSen. Rand Paul, R-Kentucky, said that while he supported funding going to Ukraine, the United States is going to have to borrow that funding from China, which “doesn’t make any sense.”\nSen. Pete Ricketts, R-Nebraska, said he was also concerned about China’s potential participation in the funding. He said Ukrainians may be tempted to take funding from China for reconstruction.\nMany Democrats and Republicans on the committee, including Cardin, emphasized the importance of aiding Ukraine at a time when Russian has strengthened ties to Hezbollah and Hamas, both designated as terrorist organizations, as well as to China and Iran.\nIdaho Sen. James Risch, the ranking Republican on the foreign relations panel, said that the attacks on Israel have highlighted the relationships among these powers. He charged that the Biden administration hasn’t enforced sanctions against Iran, leading to China giving funds to Iran, which then have been used to finance Hamas and Russia, Risch said.\n“We cannot help Israel without confronting these realities,” Risch said.\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, said in Senate floor remarks that the Biden administration’s request for helping Ukraine as well as Israel “falls short of adequately addressing” multiple national security threats.\n“Russian war in Europe, Chinese aggression in Asia, Iran-backed terror in the Middle East, and a southern border that’s dangerously lacking in credible enforcement. This is the reality we face. Right now,” McConnell said."

    "title": "Justices urged to keep gun ban to protect domestic violence survivors",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  The Supreme Court on Tuesday heard oral arguments over the constitutionality of a federal law barring people involved in domestic violence from owning guns.\nAt issue is a ruling earlier this year by the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals that the 29-year-old statute prohibiting firearms ownership for those under domestic violence restraining orders was an outlier…that our ancestors would never have accepted.\nZackey Rahimi, a Texas drug dealer, was arrested in 2021 for the ownership of several firearms after being subject to a domestic violence restraining order by his ex-girlfriend. Rahimi claimed that the law that deems it unlawful to sell a firearm to a person who “represents a credible threat to the physical safety of such intimate partner or child” or is under a domestic violence restraining order, violates his Second Amendment rights.\nThe law requires restraining orders in domestic violence cases to be filed with the national background check system. Such orders are one criteria for halting the purchase of a gun.\nSolicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar told the justices that if someone is considered irresponsible or dangerous, even if not a felon, including children or the mentally ill, that person should not possess a firearm. Prelogar said Rahimi was dangerous because he was under a domestic violence restraining order.\n\n\nDownload the CNS app from the App Store or Google Play\n\n“Guns and domestic abuse are a deadly combination,” she said. “As this court has said, all too often, the only difference between a battered woman and a dead woman is the presence of a gun.”\nRahimi’s attorney, J. Matthew Wright, argued for the adoption of Founding era legal principles. Rahimi should not be prevented from possessing a firearm because there is no historical basis for it, Wright said.\n“Theres no history of bans for people who were part of the national community. They dont exist,” Wright said.\nWright acknowledged there were bans of guns from so-called disfavored groups like enslaved people, but insisted that those bans should not be looked at as historical evidence.\nSome justices expressed skepticism about the parameters of Wright’s argument.\n“Im a little troubled by having a ‘history and traditions’ test that also requires some sort of culling of the history so that only certain peoples history counts.” Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson said.\nChief Justice John Roberts pressed Right to concede that his client was dangerous. When Wright started asking for a definition, Roberts described a dangerous person as “someone whos shooting, you know, at people.”\n“That’s fair,” Wright answered.\nThe Rahimi case came before the court a year after the justices ruled in a previous gun rights case, New York State Rifle  Pistol Association, Inc. v. Bruen. In that case, two men challenged a New York law that required people to demonstrate a special need for an unrestricted license to carry a gun in public.\nThe Supreme Court ruled that the law was unconstitutional because no other constitutional right requires proof of special need and restrictions on firearms must be upheld by an historic tradition of such regulations.\nPrelogar argued that the Bruen ruling was being misinterpreted in lower courts.\nOutside of the Supreme Court, protesters shared personal accounts of domestic violence and urged the justices to “disarm domestic violence,” as some posters read.\nMaryland Legal Aid joined a host of other legal services and counseling organizations in a “friend of the court” brief arguing that the federal ban on firearms sales to those under protective orders should be upheld.\nAmee Vora, the MLA’s director of advocacy for family law, said in a statement that the Fifth Circuit had prioritized “guns over the lives of domestic violence survivors.”\n“Having represented countless low-income clients – who are disproportionately at risk for both domestic violence and gun violence – in civil protection order cases, we know firsthand the vital role that mandatory firearm removal laws play in preventing further violence in our clients’ homes and communities,” Vora said.\nAnother amicus brief was filed by 171 senators and House members, including Maryland Democratic Sens. Ben Cardin and Chris Van Hollen and Maryland Democratic Reps. Kweisi Mfume, Jamie Raskin, Dutch Ruppersberger, John Sarbanes and David Trone.\nThe lawmakers said the Fifth Circuit’s decision “infringes on Congress’s considerable legislative authority to pass common-sense gun legislation.”\n“Where there is a potential conflict between a statute and the Constitution, this Court seeks to harmonize the two, not simply strike the statute down,” the brief states. “The Second Amendment context is no different  it is flexible enough to tolerate a number of gun regulations in keeping with Congress’s traditional legislative authority.”\nRahimi is currently being held on $53,000 bail in Tarrant County, Texas.\nThe high court is set to rule on the case by the summer of 2024."

    "content": "WASHINGTON  Former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley told senators Thursday that if he is confirmed as the new commissioner of the Social Security Administration, he would focus on improving service and boosting the morale of the sprawling agency.\n“We can and we must do better as a nation, and as an agency. I believe President (Joe) Biden nominated me for this position because I have the leadership skills, the management skills, and the experience — needed at this moment — to lead this organization forward,” O’Malley told the Senate Finance Committee.\nThe commissioner is the highest-ranking official of the Social Security Administration, which has been plagued in recent years by crashing phone services, short-staffed offices and low staff morale.\n“Governor OMalley knows how to work within budgetary lines, master technology using data metrics and so on to point the right resources to the right people to do the job,” former Maryland Sen. Barbara Mikulski said of her fellow Democrat in introducing him to the Senate panel.\nO’Malley, who briefly ran for president in 2016, served as governor from 2006 to 2015 and before that was the mayor of Baltimore, received a generally friendly reception from senators.\nTheres not a challenge hell back away from, Sen. Ben Cardin, D-Maryland, said of OMalley. Hes an incredible manager, which is exactly what the Social Security Administration needs.\n\n\n    \n  \n\n    Download the CNS app from the Apple Store or Google Play\n  \n\nSen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tennessee, asked him what he thought his most relevant experience was that would transfer into running the agency.\n“I believe the most relevant piece is my ability to apply principles of performance management in ways that improve customer service and also build up employee morale,” O’Malley said. “So its truly about my experience as a manager, and in particular performance management applied to large organizations.”\nO’Malley acknowledged the ongoing problems at the Social Security Administration.\n“What excites me about this challenge is that its all about operations,” he said. “Its all about improving customer service…After being a mayor and being a governor, the one piece of it that I really truly miss is pulling people together, around the data, the information, seeing if what were doing is actually working to improve customer service.”\nSen. Steve Daines, R-Montana, noted that Social Security is forecast to be insolvent in 10 years and suffers from a lack of public trust.\nO’Malley responded that he would focus on restoring trust by shortening holding times on the phone and reducing delays in sending out benefits. He also emphasized it was Congress’s duty to act to avoid insolvency and pledged to support bipartisan efforts to do so.\nThe Social Security Administration has had a long presence in Maryland over its 88-year history. First headquartered at the Candler Building in Baltimore’s Inner Harbor in 1936, the agency since 1960 has been based in Woodlawn, Maryland, in Baltimore County. Social Security employs nearly 12,000 people across Maryland, making it the third-largest non-state employer.\nDr. Kilolo Kijakazi, a former policy analyst, has been serving as acting Social Security commissioner since 2021, when Biden fired then-Commissioner Andrew Saul, a holdover from the Trump administration.\nNormally, the commissioner serves a six-year term and does not change with new presidential administrations. But Saul’s past involvement with the Manhattan Institute, a conservative think tank that calls for cuts to Social Security, alienated Democrats. Biden removed Saul after his refusal to resign and nominated O’Malley in July to fill the remainder of the term that ends in January 2025."

    "title": "Top FBI and Homeland Security officials warn of higher terrorism threat in US",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  The FBI’s director and the secretary of homeland security told Congress Tuesday that the United States faces increased threats from extremists amid the escalating conflict between Israel and Hamas.\nWe assess that the actions of Hamas and its allies will serve as an inspiration the likes of which we havent seen since ISIS launched its so-called caliphate several years ago, FBI Director Christopher Wray told the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. He further elaborated that the terror threat in the U.S. has increased because of Hamas recent attacks, which killed 1,400 people and led to the kidnapping of over 200 others in Israel.\nThe panel hearing explored the increasing calls for attacks against Americans both at home and abroad by multiple foreign terrorist organizations, including Hamas, Al Qaeda and Hezbollah.\nWray revealed that the FBI has multiple ongoing investigations into individuals affiliated with the foreign terrorist organization, referring to Hamas. The agency is scrutinizing its intelligence to assess how the threat from Hamas may be evolving.\nWere continuing to scrutinize our intelligence to assess how the threat may be evolving, Wray added.\nHomeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said that there has been an increase in reports of threats against Jewish, Muslim, and Arab American communities and institutions, exacerbating a pre-existing rise in antisemitism both globally and in the United States.\nAfter the Hamas attacks, other terrorist organizations have leveraged the conflict for propaganda.\n\n\n    \n  \n\n    Download the CNS app from the Apple Store or Google Play\n  \n\nWeve seen it from Al-Qaeda affiliates, almost every single one. Weve also seen it from ISIS, which ideologically isnt aligned with a group like Hamas, Christine Abizaid, Director of the National Counterterrorism Center, told senators.\nA heated moment in the hearing came when Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Missouri, questioned Mayorkas about a DHS employee who had made extreme comments against Israel and its supporters. The employee, Nejwa Ali, had posted inflammatory remarks and images online, including a fake graphic of a Hamas paraglider with a machine gun flying into Israel.\nHawley questioned why she had not been fired and whether she had adjudicated any cases involving Israelis seeking asylum. The secretary responded that the individual had been placed on administrative leave but could not speak to an ongoing personnel matter.\nHawley retorted that Mayorkas’s response was “despicable.”\nMayorkas, who is Jewish, was clearly angry.\n“Number one, what I found despicable is the implication that this language, tremendously odious, actually could be emblematic of the sentiments of the 260,000 men and women of the Department of Homeland Security,” Mayorkas said.\n“Number two, Senator Hawley takes an adversarial approach to me in this question, and perhaps he doesn’t know my own background,” the secretary continued. “Perhaps he does not know that I am the child of a Holocaust survivor. Perhaps he does not know that my mother lost almost all her family at the hands of the Nazis. And so I find his adversarial tone to be entirely misplaced. I find it to be disrespectful of me and my heritage.\nMayorkas said that the DHS is allocating funds through a non-profit security grant program to enhance the safety of religious sites.\nJewish leaders tell me that their congregants are scared to go to synagogue, said Sen. Maggie Hassan, D-New Hampshire.\nFrom the senseless murder of a six-year-old boy in Illinois to over 300 recorded anti-Semitic incidents between October 7 and October 23, hate and the threat of hate-based violence is exploding across the country, Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, D-Arizona, said.\nMayorkas said his department and the FBI were collaborating on various initiatives.\n“Were sharing intelligence and information with law enforcement agencies at the state, local, tribal, territorial, and campus levels,” the secretary said."

    "title": "With war in Gaza raging, Senate confirms Jack Lew as new US envoy to Israel",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  The Senate on Tuesday confirmed Jack Lew as the new U.S. ambassador to Israel. The move comes amid the humanitarian crisis in the Middle East as war rages between Israel and Hamas.\nThe vote for confirmation was 53-43, with all Democrats, three independents and just two Republicans  Sens. Rand Paul of Kentucky, and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina  supporting Lew.\n“Mr. Lew has a strong, long, proven record as a strong public servant and ferocious ally of Israel, and it will help send a powerful message of support to Israel to have this appointment filled ASAP,” Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-New York, said on the Senate floor.\nSen. Ben Cardin, D-Maryland, and the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, in Senate remarks called Lew “eminently qualified.”\n“He has the political acumen that we need for our ambassador at this time. He has the respect of the Israeli officials,” Cardin said.\n“After meeting personally with Jack Lew, I found him to be a thoughtful individual who will strive to do his best to represent the United States in Israel,” Paul said in a statement on X. “I also believe it to be important to have an ambassador during the current crisis in Israel.”\nLew has had a decades-long record of public service. He was the treasury secretary in the Obama administration, where he also earlier served as President Barack Obama’s chief of staff, as well as the director of the Office of Management and Budget under both the Clinton and Obama administrations.\nThe Senate hasn’t had a U.S. ambassador to Israel since July, when Tom Nides left the position.\nLew has also been a managing partner at Lindsay Goldberg LLC, co-president of the board at the National Library of Israel USA, and a member of the Council on Foreign Relations.\nBiden nominated Lew in early September. After the Oct. 7 massacre in Israel by Hamas, Cardin and other Democrats pressed to speed up Lew’s confirmation.\nMany Republicans objected to Lew’s nomination, pointing out his role in the 2015 Iran nuclear deal under the Obama administration.\n“Frankly, I don’t think that (the nomination) either sends a message to Israel or anyway in the Middle East that we are serious about taking on and dealing with the threat that Iran poses because obviously he was the architect of the Iranian nuclear deal,” Sen. John Thune, R- South Dakota, told reporters just before the vote.\n“We negotiated with Iran to have them rollback their nuclear program in exchange for which they would get access to money that was their money that we had frozen,” Lew said during his confirmation hearing. “All we did was facilitate that transaction.”\nLew, who is Jewish, said to the senators: “I want to be clear, Iran is a threat to regional stability and to Israel’s existence.”\nThe confirmation comes as Congress looks to address how to provide funding in support of Israel.\n“We need to provide the medical needs, safe passage for Palestinians trying to avoid the conflict,” Cardin said. “All this is made much more difficult because of Hamas. These challenges require a U.S. partnership. We need a confirmed ambassador.”"

    "title": "Maryland&#8217;s Sarbanes won&#8217;t seek reelection to the House next year",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  Nine-term Rep. John Sarbanes, D-Maryland, announced Thursday that he will not seek reelection in 2024.\nSarbanes, 61, said in a statement that he plans to serve out his current term.\nElected to the House in 2006, Sarbanes represents Marylands 3rd District, which includes Annapolis, Howard County and portions of Anne Arundel and Carroll Counties.\nHe currently serves on the House Energy and Commerce Committee.\nHere is his statement on his plans to retire:\n“I believe in public service. My siblings and I grew up with the teaching that there are many ways to serve. Being in Congress is one of them — a truly humbling opportunity to make a difference. But before coming to Congress, I also found great reward in working with nonprofits, volunteering and otherwise contributing to my community. That too is a powerful form of public service. For some time now, I have found myself drawn back to that kind of work — wanting to explore the many opportunities to serve that exist outside of elected office. With that in mind, I have decided not to seek re-election in 2024. While I am making this announcement today — specifically for the benefit of candidates interested in running for my seat in next year’s election — I’m not going anywhere for the next fourteen months. That’s what’s left in my term and I’m committed to finishing strong.\nStepping away from Congress voluntarily — whether it’s at the eighteen-year mark as in my case or at any point — is not an easy thing. Because the stakes of what we do are so high and because we trust in our value to the team, the case can always be made to press on to the next election. Our country faces many challenges right now, but the Democratic caucus that will carry forward into the next Congress and beyond has a strength and unity of purpose that bodes well for the future. Our new leadership is making all the right moves to bring Democrats back into the majority in January 2025. It makes me hopeful about America’s prospects at this moment when I am pivoting in a new direction.\nLooking back on my nine terms in Congress, I feel an enormous sense of gratitude and accomplishment. These have been among the most rewarding years of my professional life, working with dedicated staff and amazing colleagues — especially the outstanding Maryland delegation — on the most pressing issues of our time. Over the next fourteen months, I’ll continue to focus on those issues as well as the critical responsibility of providing timely and responsive constituent service.\nFor more than a decade, I have made strengthening our democracy my top legislative priority in Congress. That special commitment is one I will maintain through the remainder of my term in order to help position Democrats for the coming window of opportunity in 2025. I am thrilled that Representative Katherine Clark has agreed to shepherd the passage of the Freedom to Vote Act in the next Congress. Under the steady hand of Leader Jeffries, our caucus’ unanimous backing of this legislation along with the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act fortifies the ongoing effort to pass both bills into law. I will be a partner in that effort until it succeeds.\nOver the years, I have been blessed with wonderful supporters who kept me strong and motivated every single day. I am forever grateful to them. Of course, I owe special thanks to the residents of Maryland’s Third District. At every turn they inspired me to pursue the highest standard of constituent service. Addressing their priorities from my position on the Energy and Commerce Committee — health care, the environment and so many other issues — has made me a much more knowledgeable and effective advocate and I will carry that skill set into continued work on behalf of the community.\nSuccess in any endeavor depends on one’s teammates and it has been my greatest privilege to work with outstanding staff whose belief in public service has fortified me from the outset. They are another reason I am optimistic about the future.\nIt will come as a surprise to no one that the example of my late father, Senator Paul Sarbanes, greatly influenced my decision to enter politics. Within my own limitations, I’ve strived to meet the standard of thoughtfulness and integrity that he brought to public service.\nAs someone deeply proud of my Greek heritage, I am indebted to the Greek-American community for embracing my entry into politics and for the trust so many placed in me to be a champion of the strong relationship between the United States, Greece and Cyprus. In that capacity, I have had the opportunity to meet and collaborate with an exemplary group of community leaders whose philotimo is a model for all.\nAs for my family, appreciation runs too deep for words. I can’t do anything without them and they know that.\nFinally, I am keenly aware that what makes the world go round is the unsung work of spirited leaders on the ground in every community. To those true movers and shakers who took the time and patience to connect me with the things that matter, thank you for your wonderful partnership! Our work together will continue.\nI’m excited about starting a new chapter, but for now, there’s still much to do in the remaining fourteen months of the 118th Congress, and that’s where all my energy and attention will be.”"

    "title": "Most Maryland House Democrats see new House speaker as extremist, threat to democracy",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  Newly-elected House Speaker Mike Johnson is drawing sharp criticisms from most of Maryland’s House Democrats, who view the Louisiana lawmaker as a political extremist and opponent of democracy.\n“Speaker Mike Johnson? Anti-choice, anti-LGBTQ, anti-gun safety, anti-democracy. This is what theocracy looks like,” Rep. Jamie Raskin tweeted Wednesday. Raskin was a member of the House panel that investigated the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol and was the lead manager in the second impeachment trial of former President Donald Trump.\nJohnson was a key player in GOP challenges to the 2020 election results. A Trump ally, he has been an election denier.\nRaskin added in an interview on MSNBC that he is a decent guy, and he is a nice guy, but nobody should be fooled by it.” “Mike Johnson is the kind of guy who often flies under the radar because he touts his extremist views in a quieter fashion than the Matt Gaetzs of the world,” Rep. David Trone said on X, formerly known as Twitter. “But make no mistake, he is an anti-abortion, anti-LGBTQI+, election denier who has no business as Speaker of the House.”\nAfter three weeks of infighting among GOP members, Johnson was elected Wednesday the 56th House speaker.\nRep. Kweisi Mfume said the three-week impasse by “radical MAGA Republicans embarrassingly placed this Congress in a complete standstill and put the division they bring to themselves and this country on full display.”\n“Unfortunately, it’s likely the Republican majority will now be more focused on an ideology that includes defending attempts to overturn the 2020 presidential election, criminalizing a womans right to choose, cutting Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, and endangering LGBTQ+ and minority communities,” the congressman said on X.\nRep. Glenn Ivey called the new speaker “MAGA Mike Johnson.”\nThe congressman tweeted that the House’s new leader “may be a nice guy, but hes a radical opponent of reproductive freedom  LGBTQ+ rights. He supports criminalizing abortion nationwide, no exceptions. And last year, he voted against marriage equality for same-sex  interracial couples.”\n“After three weeks of chaos, even House Republicans are admitting they can’t govern,” Rep. Dutch Ruppersberger tweeted. “It’s time for them to abandon MAGA extremism so Congress can get back to meeting the urgent needs of everyday Americans.”\nRep. Steny Hoyer told Bloomberg TV that he was concerned that Johnson is an election denier.\nThe former House majority leader said he did not know Johnson well, but held out hope for bipartisanship.\n“He’s new, he hasnt been in leadership,” Hoyer said. “We will have to see what he does. We know what he’s said in the past, we know what he’s done in the past. If he goes down that route, that hard-right route, then I think he’s in for a rough time. And we’re not going to get to the bipartisanship that he talked about and that (Democratic) Leader (Hakeem) Jeffries (D-New York) talked about.”\n“So hopefully, he now sees with the responsibility of running the entire House, not just a faction of the House, seeks out to come together and have agreements that can have a positive result on our legislative record, a positive result in helping people and a positive result in keeping the government open and operating,” Hoyer said.\nRep. John Sarbanes tweeted that “the American people are relying on Congress to put the political games behind us. Going forward, I hope Speaker Johnson will work with @HouseDemocrats to avoid a shutdown, defend democracy at home and abroad, and deliver for our constituents.”\nRep. Andy Harris, the lone Republican in Maryland’s House delegation, said on X: “I back @RepMikeJohnson 100%. He’s exactly the kind of leader the House, Washington, and America needs in this time of national and global crisis.”"

    "title": "Senate panel moves Lew nomination to floor &#8211; a step closer to getting US envoy to Israel",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  The Senate Foreign Relations Committee voted Wednesday to advance Jacob Lew as the nominee for ambassador to Israel. Lew’s nomination was advanced on a 12-9 vote. Sen. Rand Paul, R-Kentucky, was the only GOP panel member to join 11 Democrats voting to advance the nomination. The nine other GOP senators on the committee opposed Lew. Lew needed a simple majority for his nomination to move to the Senate floor, where a confirmation vote could be next week at the earliest, NBC News reported. The committee’s chairman, Sen. Ben Cardin, D-Maryland, said in a statement that he was “pleased” to see Lew’s nomination moved forward. He said the nominee “has the expertise, temperament, and established record of public service needed for this critical diplomatic post.”Lew’s “in-depth knowledge about the region will play a critical role in strengthening the U.S.-Israel relationship moving forward,” Cardin said.Cardin reiterated the importance of quickly confirming Lew as ambassador to Israel.“The urgency to confirm this highly-qualified nominee has never been greater,” the senator said. “Israel is at war, and the United States needs an experienced, Senate-confirmed ambassador on the ground working hand in hand with our Israeli partners.”The panel’s vote came a week after Lew’s confirmation hearing, where he was intensely questioned by many Republican senators because of his connection to the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, negotiated when he was secretary of the treasury. Republican Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas and Bill Hagerty of Tennessee were especially aggressive, questioning everything from Lew’s response to the administration’s handling of the Hamas attacks on Israel to whether he has an explanation for Irans revenue from oil.Paul, however, was absent from last Wednesday’s hearing. The United States has not had an ambassador to Israel since Thomas Nides exited the role in July. ​​“Israel has not just a right…but a responsibility to defend itself,” Lew said at last week’s hearing. “It’s not for revenge, it’s for defending your people.”"

    "title": "Maryland joins DC, 40 other states suing Meta, claiming mental health harms to children",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  Maryland, the District of Columbia and 40 other states are suing Meta alleging that its platforms cause harm to children by building addictive features, Maryland Attorney General Anthony Brown announced Tuesday. “Our country is facing a youth mental health crisis fueled by young peoples extensive and compulsive use of, and reliance on, social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram,” Brown said at a press conference outside Hampstead Hill Academy, a Baltimore public school. “This has placed an entire generation of young people in jeopardy.”Maryland and 32 other states are filing a joint lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, and the District of Columbia and eight other states are filing separate complaints in federal, state or local courts. The scope of the legal claims may vary, but all are expected to assert that Meta used harmful and manipulative tactics purposefully to keep children on its platforms. In 2021, a bipartisan coalition of state attorneys general announced an investigation into Meta, focusing on whether the parent company of Instagram and Facebook violated consumer protection laws by promoting the sites’ apps to children and teens. “Based on the information obtained during that investigation, we allege that Meta’s actions have violated the federal Childrens Online Privacy Protection Act,” Brown said.Nationwide, states have seen a surging youth mental health crisis: the number of children ages 3 to 17 who experienced anxiety or depression from 9.4% in 2016 to 11.8% in 2020  a 25% increase, according to the National Institute of Health. Maryland ranked 19th in the nation for overall child well-being.“Just like Big Tobacco did a generation ago, Meta has chosen to maximize its profits at the expense of public health, specifically the health of our children,” Brown charged. In the suit Maryland joined, the attorneys general allege that “Meta has harnessed powerful and unprecedented technologies to entice, engage, and ultimately ensnare youth and teens.”“Its motive is profit, and in seeking to maximize its financial gains, Meta has repeatedly misled the public about the substantial dangers of its Social Media Platforms. It has concealed the ways in which these Platforms exploit and manipulate its most vulnerable consumers: teenagers and children. And it has ignored the sweeping damage these Platforms have caused to the mental and physical health of our nation’s youth,” the filing states.Meta said in a statement that it agreed with “the attorneys general’s commitment to providing teens with safe, positive experiences online, and have already introduced over 30 tools to support teens and their families.”But Meta added: “We’re disappointed that instead of working productively with companies across the industry to create clear, age-appropriate standards for the many apps teens use, the attorneys general have chosen this path.”Brown was joined by Hampstead Hill Academy Principal Matthew Hornbeck, who said that over the 20 years he has been at the school he has seen the impact the rise in social media use has had on his students. Hornbeck described measures to curb phone use at Hampstead Hill, but stressed they were “merely a workaround.” “(Social media) hijacks normal, healthy thinking,” Hornbeck said. “It sucks up so much time and keeps the user wanting more and more. Its not an overstatement to say it can steal big chunks of a childhood.” “The urge to check your phone is stronger than any consequence we have at school,” he said.Treeme Cannizzaro, an 8th grade student at Hampstead Hill, said at the press conference that limiting phone use in schools does not address the impact social media has on mental health when students are not at school. “My friends and I cant help but get on our phones to see what weve missed,” Cannizzaro said. “Limiting access to social media has had a positive impact on my mental health during the school day, and I hope that social media companies can find more ways to decrease the anxiety and depression my friends and I feel from social interactions online.”In May, the Federal Trade Commission proposed  barring Meta from monetizing the data it collects for underage users. Also in May, U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy issued an advisory stating that, although there are some benefits, social media use presents a “profound risk of harm” for children and called for further research into social media’s impact on youth mental health.“Children are exposed to harmful content on social media, ranging from violent and sexual content, to bullying and harassment,” Murthy said in a statement. “And for too many children, social media use is compromising their sleep and valuable in-person time with family and friends.”Efforts to regulate social media’s impact on social media have gained traction this year, but also have faced challenges in court. Federal judges blocked newly-passed children’s safety laws in California and Arkansas."

    "title": "DC area Argentine expats to vote Sunday in presidential election featuring Trump-like candidate",
    "content": "WASHINGTON   Argentine expats from across the Washington metropolitan area will head to the Argentine Embassy on Sunday to vote in their nation’s presidential election. \nThe vote comes in the midst of a severe economic crisis in Argentina as the country suffers from over 100% annual inflation and nearly 40% of its population lives in poverty. \n“What Im hearing from people there now, is that the current crisis is probably the worst they rememberwith the currency losing value on a daily basis. The economic situation is critical,” Gabriel Fur, 40, of Washington, told Capital News Service. A senior associate at an international bank and originally from Buenos Aires, Fur is one of thousands of Argentines eligible to vote on Sunday. \nNearly 451,200 Argentines who live abroad are eligible to vote, according to the Embassy of Argentina’s website. In the United States, about 90,000 are eligible, according to the Cámara Nacional Electoral, the governmental agency that conducts elections. Voting is mandatory for Argentine citizens between the ages of 18 and 70. \nBUENOS AIRES  The Casa Rosada (Spanish for “Pink House”) in Buenos Aires, the official offices of the president of Argentina. (Ryan Mercado/Capital News Service)\nFur is one of many Argentines who call themselves “economic migrants  those who moved abroad to seek better economic opportunities. \n“Argentina has been in an economic crisis, on and off, for decades now, so this is not new. We are very resilient people who know how to navigate during a crisis,” Fur said.\nArgentina has suffered through decades of economic instability, most notably in 2001, when the country defaulted on its external debt, leading to a severe recession and riots. This year, the Argentine peso was devalued to a record low of one U.S. dollar equalling 1,000 pesos on the black market, according to Bloomberg. \nLA PLATA, Argentina  The provincial campaign headquarters of presidential candidate Javier Milei in La Plata. (Ryan Mercado/Capital News Service)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the thousands of Argentines expats, this shared history and economic anxiety has impacted their political views.\nArgentines elect a president every four years, with political parties holding primary elections to choose candidates. Primary elections are “open and simultaneous,” which means any voter may vote for any candidate.\nThe results of the Aug. 13 primaries shocked many. \nFar-right libertarian economist Javier Milei, an admirer of former President Donald Trump, won 30% of the vote, the most of any candidate in a 27-candidate field. His win signifies that Argentines have grown tired of mainstream political coalitions, according to analysts.\nMilei is opposed by center-right former Security Minister Patricia Bullrich and current Peronist Minister of the Economy Sergio Massa. Bullrich is running on a platform to reduce taxes, fight corruption, and reduce currency controls. Massa is running a campaign to give higher salaries to workers to combat inflation and create a common currency with regional economies like Brazil. \nTwo more candidates are also running: left-wing socialist Myriam Bregman, of the Frente de Izquierda y de Trabajadores  Unidad coalition, and centrist Juan Schiaretti of the Hacemos por Nuestro País coalition. Both are only polling around 3 to 4% in the latest polls.  \nBUENOS AIRES  An election poster in the Argentine capital promotes Peronist presidential candidate Sergio Massa and other party candidates. (Ryan Mercado/Capital News Service)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo be elected president, a candidate must either win 40% of the vote and be ten points ahead of the nearest competitor, or win 45%. According to the latest polls, all five of the main candidates are below 40%, so a second-round run-off will most likely be held in late November. \nMilei is a member of the Argentine Congress who rose to fame in recent years over his far-right and controversial statements. He founded his own party, La Libertad Avanza.  \nMilei has said he plans to up-end the traditional system of politics, promising that as president he would abolish the central bank, replace the Argentine peso with the U.S. dollar, get rid of comprehensive sex education in schools, and repeal legislation that legalized abortion.\nMilei also embraces far-right political leaders and ideologies, calling his alignment with former President Donald Trump and former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro “almost natural.” \nAt a presidential debate earlier this month, Milei espoused debunked historical revisionism by denying that less than 30,000 people disappeared under Argentina’s military dictatorship from 1976 to 1983.\nSuch views have alarmed some voters.\n“About Milei, I feel Im really against him. He’s someone that does not represent my values and the values of everybody that I know in Argentina,” said Washington resident “Sebastian.” The 50-year-old school teacher did not want his last name to be used in this story due to political polarization in Argentina that is so deep it is called “La grieta” (the chasm). \nSebastian is an economic migrant who left Argentina over 20 years ago. \nHe sees parallels between Trump and Milei. “He is a polarizing radical candidate similar to what we see in Bolsonaro, Trump, Orban  a populist,” Sebastian said.\nFor other Argentine expats, Milei’s rise was seen as predictable. \nBUENOS AIRES  Patricia is order. says the billboard for Juntos por el Cambio presidential candidate Patricia Bullrich. Argentines vote on Sunday. (Ryan Mercado/Capital News Service)\n“There is a segment of the population that its very upset with the political system…The segment of the population, mostly people below 40, find Milei as the way to express disappointment with the political system,” said Dr. Sebastian Galiani, professor of economics at the University of Maryland.\nGaliani was Argentina’s deputy finance minister in the administration of former center-right President Mauricio Macri. Galiani blames the current government’s poor economic performance for Milei’s rise, but doesn’t see Milei’s proposals as realistic.\n“Its very unclear how he (Milei) can govern,” Galiani said. “Hes not going to have any congressmen, no senators, no governors. So he’s going to be an extremely weak president.”\nGaliani was referring to provincial elections that pick governors and legislators also taking place this year. So far, Milei’s party has not won any governorships and few provincial legislature seats. Argentines will also elect 137 out of 257 members of Congress, and it is unclear if Milei’s party will win any seats.\nLike many in his party, Galiani is supporting the center-right coalition, Juntos por el Cambio, and its candidate, Bullrich. Her coalition won the abroad vote in the last election in 2019 and Galiani thinks it will do the same again this year. \nFur also backs Bullrich, calling her “the most rational of the main candidates.”\n“She was Macris secretary of security, and she did a great job there, fighting narcos and mafias,” he said.\nBUENOS AIRES  The Argentine National Congress Palace in Buenos Aires. (Ryan Mercado/Capital News Service)\nHowever, Bullrich’s controversial past as a former member of a left-wing guerilla organization known as “the Montoneros” in the 1970s and her subsequent ideological turn from left-wing to the hard-right have left some expat voters uneasy. “I dont necessarily agree with how Bullrich is surrounded, ‘that law and order’ message,” Sebastian said.\n“I may not agree with her, but she has experience in governing, and I think that she could do a good job,” he added. \nOne theme emerged among expat voters interviewed: their dislike of the ruling Peronist coalition, Union por la Patria. \nPeronism is a political ideology named after former Argentine President Juan Peron who governed Argentina from 1946 to 1955, and again from 1973 to 1974, and his wife, Eva Duarte, or “Evita” as she was known. Political scientists find it difficult to define Peronism, but it has elements of liberalism and conservatism, and populism and nationalism. The current Peronist coalition includes parties ranging from center to left-wing.\nPeronist coalitions have ruled Argentina for 15 of the last 20 years. Many people see them as responsible for the current economic situation and widespread government corruption. Vice President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner was convicted last year for corruption when she was president from 2007 to 2015. She is still allowed to serve as vice president as her case goes through appeal. \nIncumbent Peronist President Alberto Fernández is so unpopular that he opted not to run for reelection. Massa is the Peronist candidate in this year’s election.\n“His (Massa’s) management has been terrible. He took office in August 2022, and in a bit over a year he has tripled the exchange rate,” said Fur. Others shared his opinions.\n“I dont like Massa. But I dont like the other parties either,” said “Malena,” 26, who until September had worked for two years as an au pair in Chevy Chase, Maryland. She is from Santiago Del Estero province in northern Argentina. Like Sebastian, Malena asked not to be identified by her real name because she said she is afraid to discuss politics openly due to political corruption in her hometown. \nWASHINGTON  The Embassy of Argentina in Washington, where Argentine expats will cast votes Sunday in their nations presidential election. (Ryan Mercado/Capital News Service)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“In my city, a lot of people work for the government,” Malena explained. “The elections are secret. Youre allowed to not say who you are voting for, but they (the government) can know if their employees are voting for them or not. So if they discover you didn’t vote for them, the next day you’re fired.” \nFerreyra returned home to Argentina in late September. Before she left, she told CNS: “Its a very hard situation. I really want to go back. But I think my quality of life is going to be bad. And its sad, you know?”\nShe is among the nearly 30% of Argentines who said in an Oct. 12 poll that they are either undecided or considering voting “blank” on their ballot, an option citizens have if they don’t want to vote for any candidate. \nHowever, Malena said she is willing to give candidates with radical platforms a second look: “For example, Milei, well, we can give him a taste because it can’t get any worse. He is terrible and weve heard a lot of bad things about him but he is a radical change. Maybe lets give him a chance.”\nShe also said she is very worried about the state of her country: “Im very scared. Im very concerned, I dont like any of the candidates and I think most of the people in Argentina think the same.”\nSebastian shared her concerns.\n“Im afraid that intolerance, those factions of society, that will get power and Im afraid that everything that we achieved in social progress in Argentina…I’m afraid they will reverse.” \n—\nRyan Mercado, a reporter with the Washington bureau of Capital News Service, spent this past summer in Buenos Aires learning Spanish and doing research. He covered the Aug. 13 Argentine presidential primary elections, publishing a story about voters’ opinions in the run-up to the balloting."

    "title": "Cardin, Democrats tangle with GOP over Biden nominee for US ambassador to Israel",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  Jacob Lew, President Joe Biden’s nominee for ambassador to Israel, received pushback from Republicans on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee during his confirmation hearing on Wednesday.\nA majority of Republicans signaled opposition to Lew because of his involvement in the 2015 Iran nuclear deal during the Obama administration when he was secretary of the treasury.\n“Holding hands with Iran under the table doesn’t work for me,” said Idaho Sen. James Risch, the ranking Republican on the committee.\nBut the committee’s chairman, Sen. Ben Cardin, D-Maryland, cautioned that in light of Israel’s war with Hamas, “now is not the time to play political games.”\nCardin called Lew “eminently qualified.”\n“I have seen firsthand Jack Lew’s commitment, his integrity, his dedication to American values,” Cardin said.\nWASHINGTON  Sen. Ben Cardin, D-Maryland, and chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, defended Jacob Lew, nominated to be U.S. ambassador to Israel, as eminently qualified during a Wednesday hearing. (Minnie Stephenson/Capital News Service)\nLew defended himself, saying “we negotiated with Iran to have them rollback their nuclear program in exchange for which they would get access to money that was their money that we had frozen.”\n“All we did was facilitate that transaction,” Lew said.\nSen. Bill Hagerty, R-Tennessee, presented a chart showing Iran’s revenues from oil over the years, suggesting that funding to Iran means funding to Hamas.\nLew dismissed the chart and said that Iran’s revenue has had no impact on its support for Hamas.\nThroughout the hearing, Lew repeatedly emphasized that he has been sanctioned by Iran in the past, and that he’s “proud” of that.\nSen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, aggressively interrogated Lew, saying that the administration has “undermined” Israel. Cruz referenced two now-deleted posts on X from the Palestinian affairs office and Secretary of State Antony Blinken, both calling for a ceasefire amid Hamas attacks.\nLew said he could not speak to the tweets, but continuously emphasized Israel’s right to defend itself.\n“I cannot remember a time when Israels struggle for security was not at the forefront of my mind,” Lew said. “I will do my utmost to end the horrific attacks by Hamas and ensure that Israel has what it needs to defend itself.”\nLew also responded to concerns of many Democratic senators for civilians who have been killed as “collateral damage,” saying he’s confident Israel will find a way to defend itself that minimizes civilian deaths.\n“Israel has not just a right…but a responsibility to defend itself,” Lew said. “It’s not for revenge, it’s for defending your people.”\nAlong with other Democrats, Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Maryland, praised Lew’s nomination, saying he and Lew agreed on almost everything.\n“I’ve always known you as a man of great integrity,” Van Hollen said.\nLew was nominated by Biden in early September, but Cardin and other Democrats pushed to speed up his confirmation after Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7, beginning a war that has killed thousands.\nThe confirmation hearing also comes as the White House is considering requesting $90 billion to $100 billion in aid to Israel, Ukraine and Taiwan, the Associated Press reported.\nThe previous U.S. envoy to Israel, Thomas Nides, left in July.\nBefore becoming treasury secretary, Lew was the White House chief of staff from 2012-2013 and director of Office Management and Budget (OMB) for both the Clinton and Obama administrations."

    "title": "Lawmakers, advocates tout Chesapeake Bay education and funding bill in hearing",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  A House panel held a hearing Wednesday on a bill that would boost Chesapeake Bay restoration and environmental education programs.\nThe Chesapeake Bay Science, Education, and Ecosystem Enhancement Act of 2023, sponsored by Rep. John Sarbanes, D-Maryland, would reauthorize the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Chesapeake Bay office for the first time since 2006.\nCongress has appropriated funds to the NOAA office each year, but an official reauthorization would allow the office to more efficiently carry out Chesapeake Bay restoration and monitoring initiatives, Sarbanes told the House Natural Resources Committee’s water, wildlife and fisheries subcommittee.\n“In recent decades, the health of the Chesapeake Bay has been negatively affected by nutrient runoff across the watershed, disappearing coastal and marine habitats and many other factors,” Sarbanes said. “That makes the passage of the Chesapeake Bay SEEE act all the more important.\nThe bill would also enhance NOAA’s interpretive buoy system, which collects data on water quality, weather patterns and more; enhance NOAA’s aquaculture programs that aim to support marine habitats and workers in the seafood industry; and finance grants for hands-on environmental education in kindergarten through 12th grade classrooms in the region.\nThis bill, introduced in the summer, “could not come at a more critical time,” according to Allison Colden, the Chesapeake Bay Foundation’s executive director.\n“Theres still much work to be done,” Colden said. “To achieve meaningful and lasting restoration we need all of our federal partners at the table.”\nColden pointed to the NOAA Chesapeake Bay office’s positive track record on oyster restoration projects, citing the bill as an avenue to continue such initiatives in the future by ensuring the office has financial stability.\nNOAA staff are working to restore oysters in 11 tributaries in the Chesapeake Bay watershed, and have completed restoration across more than 1,900 acres, according to a tracker by the Chesapeake Bay Program.\n“The scale of this work is really unprecedented,” Carrie Selberg Robinson, the director of NOAA’s habitat conservation office, said of the oyster conservation efforts. “We want to continue to build upon our successes that weve had and continue this great work of oyster restoration into the future.”\nRep. Rob Wittman, R-Virginia, who co-sponsored the bill, also praised its potential impact on furthering oyster restoration projects.\n“Large scale oyster restoration is really Mother Natures filter in taking a lot of stuff out of the bay that would otherwise take years and years to do,” Wittman said.\nThe Chesapeake Bay SEEE Act comes amid other efforts this congressional session to restore the health of the nation’s largest estuary.\nSarbanes also sponsored a bill that would designate the bay as a national recreation area under the National Park Service. Wittman sponsored a bill that would fund conservation initiatives in the watershed, such as a pilot project to plant riparian buffers.\nThe latest Sarbanes-Wittman bill includes provisions to instill stewardship values into students, allowing for bay restoration to continue in the long-term, witnesses told the subcommittee. If passed, the bill would continue to fund NOAA’s Chesapeake Bay-Watershed Education and Training Program, which provides grants for environmental education in the watershed.\nWitnesses faced slight pushback on the bill from Rep. Cliff Bentz, R-Oregon — the ranking member of the subcommittee — who called for supporters to provide more specific metrics about the benefits of environmental education.\nColden said that the Chesapeake Bay Foundation will provide the subcommittee with numbers ahead of further movement on the bill, but added that the positives of teaching children about caring for the bay are evident.\n“We’re building the workforce that can continue the work of Chesapeake Bay restoration,” Colden said. “Its so incredibly important to make that investment in our next generation of bay stewards.”"

    "content": "WASHINGTON  Against the backdrop of the ongoing war between Israel and Hamas, members of the Washington area Jewish community and elected officials on Friday joined to show support for Israel at a rally in the city’s Freedom Plaza.\n“Im here to say very clearly, we are here to stand with the state of Israel, to recognize the right of Israel to exist, to recognize the right for Israel to defend itself, to recognize the right of Israelis to live without fear,” Maryland Gov. Wes Moore told the crowd.\nThe “Stand with Israel” rally was jointly sponsored by the Jewish Federation of Greater Washington, the Jewish Community Relations Council of Greater Washington, the Anti-Defamation League, the American Jewish Committee and several area synagogues.\n“If you stand with Israel, you stand against Hamas and if you stand with the Palestinian people and their right to self determination, you also stand against Hamas,” Moore said.\nWASHINGTON  Maryland Gov. Wes Moore addresses a rally Friday in Washington’s Freedom Plaza, declaring “Maryland stands with Israel.” (Fatema Hosseini/Capital News Service)\nAttendees came from many religious organizations, Jewish schools, universities, synagogues and workplaces. The event drew hundreds of people of all ages. Many wore blue and white, the colors of the Israeli flag, held protest signs that said “Stand with Israel,” or waved American and Israeli flags.\n“This is the worst slaughter of Jews since the Holocaust,” said Guila Franklin Seigel, associate director of the Jewish Community Relations Council of Greater Washington. “So this rally does two things. It brings the Jewish community and our allies together at a critical time of grief and shock and anger to comfort one another and to speak in one voice. It also most importantly allows people to stand up and support Israel at a time when it is so vulnerable.”\nOn Saturday, during the Jewish holiday of Simchat Torah, militants from Hamas, an Islamist group that governs the Gaza Strip, attacked Israel. Thousands of Hamas members stormed into Israel and attacked communities, murdering hundreds of civilians. Militants also took between 100 and 150 Israeli hostages back to the Gaza Strip. Israel declared war on Hamas soon after. According to the latest count, over 1,300 Israeli civilians died in the attack.\n“Hamas has tried to break the will of Israelis and Jewish people around the world… They failed because were more united today than Ive ever seen us in my 30 years involved in this work,” said Ron Halber, executive director of the Jewish Community of Greater Washington.\nWASHINGTON  At a downtown Washington rally Friday supporting Israel, attendees hold signs denouncing Hamas for its atrocities in Saturday’s attacks. (Fatema Hosseini/Capital News Service)\nMoore brought up his experience as a soldier during the war in Afghanistan as he condemned Hamas.\n“Ive led soldiers in combat. Ive seen not just the direct but the indirect impacts of terrorism, the collateral damage that it leaves … terrorists slaughter innocent women, children and the elderly in cold blood. And thats what Hamas did.”\nRep. Steny Hoyer, D-Maryland, said theres a song that is usually used for some cause, and then it says, ‘Like a tree standing by the river, we shall not be moved.’\n“We shall not be moved, Israel, Hoyer said. We shall not be moved, America. We shall not move, all those in this world who are for justice and fairness and international law. Criminals must be called to account.”\nMaryland has one of the largest Jewish populations in the United States, according to the Jewish Virtual Library, with 204,100 Jews, or 3.9% of the state’s population, in 2022. Many high-profile Maryland politicians are staunchly pro-Israel, including Rep. Jamie Raskin and former Govs. Martin O’Malley and Larry Hogan.\nThe state with the largest Jewish population is New York, with over 1.7 million Jews  the highest such concentration of Jewish people outside of Israel.\nBoth Democrats and Republicans in the state’s congressional delegation have thrown their support behind Israel, including Rep. Claudia Tenney, R-New York, who spoke at the rally.\nWASHINGTON  Some attendees at Fridays Stand with Israel rally in the nations capital wore the Israeli flag. (Fatema Hosseini/Capital News Service)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is Israels 9/11,” Tenney said. There are three things that I believe rise above the rest: military support, holding Iran accountable, and cutting off funding for terrorist organizations like Hamas and Hezbollah.\nListening in the crowd were some with close connections to Israel.\n“Theres no other place to be, you know. I am standing with our people letting them know that our voices need to be heard,” said Michael Chelst, operator of the Char Bar, a Washington kosher restaurant, who said he has family in Israel.\n“No one is doing well,” Chelst said.\n“I also have a lot of family in Israel and a cousin in the army,” said Sam Small, a 13-year-old student at Washington’s Milton Gottesman Jewish Day School, “and I think its really important that we show people, you know, that were strong and you know that even when were being attacked, were not afraid to be proud."

    "title": "Maryland’s Cardin to introduce bipartisan resolution backing Israel",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  Sens. Ben Cardin, D-Maryland, and Jim Risch, R-Idaho, said Thursday they will introduce a bipartisan resolution supporting Israel when the Senate returns next week.\n“Hamas is a terrorist organization, and its brazen acts of terrorism against civilians must be met with a united response that strongly underscores America’s unwavering support for the people of Israel,” Cardin, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said in a statement.\n“My thoughts are with the families of those lost and missing, including families here in the United States,” he added. “The U.S. Congress is unified in working to support our ally, and to send a clear message to the world that terrorism against innocents will not be tolerated. I look forward to swiftly introducing a bipartisan resolution when the Senate reconvenes to demonstrate our ironclad support for Israel’s security.”\nRisch, the ranking Republican on the foreign relations panel, said in a statement that the devastating attacks against Israel are a reminder of why the United States unequivocally supports the people of Israel.\n“We mourn the loss of Israelis, Americans, and others who have been killed in these senseless acts of terrorism,” he said. “Support to Israel is already on the way, and Congress will work to speed up additional assistance as quickly as possible.”\nThe senators’ measure is expected to pass the Senate by unanimous consent.\nIn an unprecedented surprise attack Saturday, Hamas fired a barrage of rockets and militants stormed Israeli communities near the Gaza Strip, killing about 1,300 people, wounding more than 3,000 and abducting between 100 and 150 people on a major Jewish holiday. Israel responded with over 2,000 airstrikes and called up 360,000 reservists, the largest compulsory mobilization since the 1973 Yom Kippur War.\nIsraels retaliatory bombardment has deepened the humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip, where over two million Palestinians live densely packed and under a land, sea and air blockade enforced by Israel since 2007.\nFollowing Saturdays attack, Israel cut off Gaza’s electricity and the sole power plant is running out of fuel, which will restrict access to water, sanitation facilities and health care facilities.\nNo evidence of Irans involvement in the attack has emerged, but Iran has provided long-standing support for Hamas, including weapons and financing that may have contributed to the complex operation.\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, and Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Arkansas, said they will ask for unanimous consent in the Senate to approve legislation that would freeze $6 billion in Iranian humanitarian funds being held in Qatar that the Biden administration agreed to release in exchange for the freedom of five American prisoners held by Iran.\nThe need for that legislation may be moot: the United States and Qatar have agreed to block Iran from getting to the $6 billion account, the Washington Post and NBC reported Thursday.\nNational Security Council Coordinator for Strategic Communications Adm. John Kirby refused to confirm those reports at a White House briefing Thursday. But he emphasized that the funds in Qatar remain untouched.\nNone of it has been accessed by Iran at all, Kirby said.\nThe House, meanwhile, remains leaderless and cannot attempt to pass legislation, such as additional emergency military aid to Israel, until members elect a new speaker."

    "title": "Farewell to panda-monium: National Zoo’s iconic bears going to China with no replacements",
    "content": "WASHINGTON — The National Zoo’s three resident pandas are scheduled to return to China by Dec. 7, leaving one of the most popular attractions in the nation’s capital without its iconic bears for the first time in over 20 years. \nThe pandas are leaving the National Zoo due to the expiration of the cooperative breeding agreement with the China Wildlife Conservation Association. The departures come amid strained relations between the United States and China.\n“Our team is still in conversation about what the future of our panda conservation program is going to look like,” said Ellie Tahmaseb, spokeswoman for the Smithsonians National Zoo  Conservation Biology Institute, told Capital News Service. “Weve been doing panda conservation for the past 51 years, both with the pandas here at the zoo and pandas in China. And we will be continuing that program, whether there are pandas physically here in D.C. or not.”\nWASHINGTON  Three-year-old panda Xiao Qi Ji amuses himself on a recent day at the National Zoo. He and his parents soon will be sent to China. (Abby Wallace/Capital News Service)\nThe National Zoo currently has an adult male, Tian Tian, and an adult female, Mei Xiang, and their son, Xiao Qi Ji. Tian Tian, whose name means “more and more” in Mandarin Chinese, is 26. Mei Xiang, whose name means “beautiful fragrance” is 25. \nThe pair were born and raised at the China Research and Conservation Center for the Giant Panda in Wolong, Sichuan Province; they arrived at the National Zoo in 2000.\nMei Xiang and Tian Tian have had seven cubs, four of which, including Xiao Qi Ji, have survived to adulthood. \nEach successful panda birth at the National Zoo was through artificial insemination. Xiao Qi Ji’s surviving elder siblings were returned to China in the 2010s under the Giant Panda Cooperative Research and Breeding Agreement with the China Wildlife Conservation Association. The agreement requires that all panda cubs born at the National Zoo must be sent to China by the time they turn four.\nXiao Qi Ji, whose name translates to “little miracle,” was born in August 2020. Mei Xiang was 22 when she gave birth to him, making her the oldest giant panda to give birth in the United States. \nWASHINGTON  Tian Tian, the 26-year-old male adult panda at the National Zoo, enjoys a sunny day outside the Panda House. (Abby Wallace/Capital News Service)\nXiao Qi Ji is the youngest panda still in the country, and he will likely be the last panda born in the United States for the foreseeable future. Upon his arrival to China, he will enter into a breeding program.\nThe initial 10-year agreement with the China Wildlife Conservation Association began in December 2000 when Mei Xiang and Tian Tian arrived at the National Zoo and has been renewed three times since 2010. \nConservation efforts around the globe have proved so successful that in 2016, the International Union for Conservation of Nature upgraded the giant panda from “endangered” to “vulnerable.” \nWASHINGTON  Mei Xiang, the 25-year-old female panda at the National Zoo, offers a classic pose. (Abby Wallace/Capital News Service)\nAn estimated 1,864 giant pandas live in the wild in central China, and an additional 600 are in zoos and breeding centers around the world, according to the Smithsonian. \nWhen it is time for Mei Xiang, Tian Tian and Xiao Qi Ji to leave the National Zoo, the pandas will board a FedEx plane for an approximately 16-hour flight with a National Zoo veterinarian and panda keepers, according to Tahmaseb. \nOn the flight, the pandas and staff will bring supplies for the bears that includes food and enrichment activities. Upon their arrival, Mei Xiang, Tian Tian and Xiao Qi Ji will move into giant panda bases managed by the China Wildlife Conservation Association. It is unknown if the three will stay together. \n“I think its very bittersweet,” Tahmaseb said. “You know, we have some staff, in particular, a panda team, who have been working with these animals for decades, in some cases. And so I think its pretty hard, right?”\nDawn Ginnetti, a Washington resident and George Washington University employee, took in the pandas with her friend Shannon Whitaker during a National Zoo celebration dubbed “Panda Palooza: A Giant Farewell” during the last week of September.\nWASHINGTON  A young visitor caresses a sculpture of a panda, an animal that for decades has been the ubiquitous symbol for the National Zoo. (Abby Wallace/Capital News Service)\n“When you come here, and you see a panda, you think, ‘I want to conserve their environment. I want to preserve that. I want them to be around. So, what can I do?’” Ginnetti said. “So, it really makes people think about the planet in a different way.”\nWhitaker, a photographer and Tallahassee, Florida resident, said her favorite memory of the pandas involved bringing her three daughters up from Florida to see the bears in the winter.\n“We watched all the pandas come out and sit in the snow, and they were just so inquisitive about the weather,” Whitaker said. “It was just really beautiful. And to see my children and all the other children and adults, just in awe of that beauty.”\nTahmaseb started working at the National Zoo in February and got to celebrate each of the pandas’ birthdays this year. While marking Tian Tian and Mei Xiang’s birthdays, she began doing the math and realized these were the same pandas that she saw while visiting the National Zoo as a child. \n“That was sort of a fun realization of being like, oh my gosh, these are the exact same bears that led me to love zoos as a child,” Tahmaseb said.\nBronwen Hale Dearden, a caregiver from Loudoun County, Virginia, and her children were delighted to spend a weekday morning admiring the pandas. Despite living close to the nation’s capital, she had never seen the pandas with her kids.\n“I mean, its definitely sad,” Hale Dearden said. “I know, like my mother-in-law, and a lot of my friends are like, ‘Were gonna go! We need to go so many times!’”\n“It is a little sad because it seems like its a symbol of our relationship with China, you know? To a certain extent.” Hale Dearden said. “The withdrawal of the pandas, even though I know the official policy is that its nonpolitical, it feels like its maybe a little weighted.” \nChina’s leasing of pandas to other countries as a diplomatic tool came to be known as “panda diplomacy” and formally dates back to the 1950s. \nNearly every panda in the world is considered Chinese property. Leasing them out is seen as a gesture of goodwill to other nations and a way to broaden conservation efforts for the species. \nPandas first arrived at the National Zoo in 1972 as a gift from Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai to commemorate President Richard Nixon’s historic visit to communist China, the first by an American president.\nAt a gala during the visit, then-First Lady Patricia Nixon mentioned her fondness for pandas to Zhou: “Aren’t they cute? I love them.”\nThe premier responded with, “I’ll give you some.”\nAfter that, arrangements were made for a pair of pandas, Ling-Ling and Hsing-Hsing, to be loaned to the National Zoo. \nPat Nixon accepted the bears on behalf of the American people and joked that “panda-monium” would break out at the zoo.\nLing-Ling and Hsing-Hsing lived out the rest of their lives at the National Zoo. \nOn Dec. 30, 1992, Ling-Ling succumbed to heart failure at 23. Hsing-Hsing passed away on Nov. 28, 1999, at 28. That was the only time in the last 51 years that the National Zoo did not house pandas until Mei Xiang and Tian Tian arrived the following year. \n“There was a period between 1999 and 2000 when we didnt have pandas here at the zoo. I think a lot of people forget about that,” Tahmaseb said. “But you know, just because we didnt have pandas physically here in D.C., didnt mean that we werent gonna be having them again in the future.”\nOver the past four decades and through 10 presidencies, U.S.-China diplomatic relations have been warm and cool, but panda diplomacy has remained constant. However, those relations have entered a much cooler phase in recent years.\n“(Donald) Trump, rhetorically, was very harsh on China… with COVID, with trade,” said Dr. Scott Kastner, a University of Maryland political science professor. \nTrump launched an economic trade war against China, imposing tariffs on billions of dollars of imports from that nation. The Biden administration has maintained those tariffs.\nIn April 2022, then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-California, visited Taiwan. Beijing took great offense, claiming Taiwan is a rebellious breakaway province. \nIn January, a Chinese balloon appeared over the United States that the Biden administration ordered shot down. U.S. intelligence officials say the balloon was capable of gathering sensitive American military information. \n“For the Biden administration, I think it has been tougher on sanctioning and also being pretty serious about trying to kind of compete with China,” Kastner said. \nWASHINGTON  A child posted her heartfelt message to one of the pandas in the Panda House at the National Zoo. (Abby Wallace/Capital News Service)\nThe pandas’ departure from the National Zoo is part of a panda exodus from American zoos. \nThe San Diego Zoo returned its pandas in 2019; the Memphis Zoo returned its panda earlier this year. \nOnce the National Zoo’s pandas leave, Zoo Atlanta will be the only facility in the United States housing the animals. However, Atlanta’s four pandas are expected to return to China next year when the zoo’s loan agreement expires. \nThere still is no official date for the National Zoo’s pandas to return to China, but it must occur by Dec. 7, when the agreement expires.\n“Just because there may not be pandas at the zoo, whether thats for a short period of time or for an extended period of time, doesnt mean that we are not committed to continuing our panda conservation work,” Tahmaseb said.\nThe National Zoo has trained over 1500 professionals in panda conservation and built a research framework for breeding and reproductive support in the wild. \n“We are very hopeful for the future — both here at the zoo and for pandas in the wild,” Tahmaseb said.\nThe National Zoo is anticipating a “bit of a downturn” regarding attendance and merchandise sales after the departure, according to Tahmaseb. The facility will also stop using pandas in advertising campaigns and begin to focus more on other species that call the National Zoo home.\nAs for the National Zoo’s panda keepers, many of them will begin working with different animals on the Asia Trail. \n“Theres plenty of other animals… nobodys going to be losing their job over this,” Tahmaseb said. \nThe David M. Rubenstein Family Giant Panda Habitat was last renovated in 2007 and will remain vacant after the departure.\n“Were going to be putting in some renovations that we have discussed with our colleagues on the Chinese side,” Tahmaseb said. “Upgrades that we are going to be making, further suggestions to make sure that the habitats are as ready to go for pandas in the future, as we are hoping to have them again.”\nAs Washington prepares to say goodbye, zoo guests hope it isn’t forever.\n“If we can get them back,” Hale Dearden said. “Bring them back!”"

    "content": "﻿\nWASHINGTON — Last summer, birder Allie Judge treaded quietly up the Endless Wall trail at New River Gorge National Park  Preserve in West Virginia. The New River cut through the surrounding forest in a breathtaking view, but Allie kept her eyes trained on the vivid blue sky, ears alert. When suddenly, she heard something over the river’s rushing water.\nAllie’s love of wildlife started when she visited her family in Long Island as a kid. There, she would go to the creek and watch the baby horseshoe crabs and hermit crabs scuttle along the water.\n“And that was my favorite thing to do every summer just because you would get to see nature doing what nature does,” Judge said.\nDuring the pandemic, her dad got a pair of binoculars for Christmas. She picked them up, crossed the street to the park and began looking for birds.\n“And it’s really kind of meditative and relaxing to just like go by yourself and have a purpose and just look around and see what you can find,” Judge said.\nNow officially a birder, Allie often compares birding to collecting Pokémon.\n“When you see a bird you’ve never seen before, it really feels like an exciting, new thing you’ve unlocked,” Judge said.\nYou’ve “gotta catch ‘em all.”\nNow, Allie lives in Washington, D.C. She works in clean energy communications. But when she’s out of the office, Allie keeps her eyes and ears open. Despite living in an urban area, there are plenty of birds around the city.\nOne day, she was taking a quick walk along a loud and busy street in D.C. when she heard it.\n“I heard a clicking noise that I immediately was like, ‘Oh, that’s a woodpecker.’ And I just looked over. Right next to me. There’s a big tree, and there was a pileated woodpecker on it,” Judge said.\nWhile she’s gotten better at spotting birds and identifying bird calls, Allie will happily use the tools of her trade. She walks through the parks with her binoculars and the Merlin Bird ID app on her phone.\nThe app lets users explore different bird species likely to be in their area.\nEach species has a description and a map of where it’s likely found. To help with identification, each species has several photos and recordings of what the bird sounds like.\nFrom a pileated woodpecker.\nTo a rock pigeon.\nAnd even a red-shouldered hawk.\nAll of which are commonly found in Washington, D.C.\nAllie enjoys the patience and mindfulness of birding as she waits to see what she can find. Birding has given her a greater appreciation for nature and its beauty.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER \n“You know, you’d be surprised how often I’ll just, like, look up at a light post and see a hawk up there or something. People don’t really think about that, because they’re not really like looking for it,” Judge said. “But the more you sort of start thinking about it and start looking for it, the more you see it in your own backyard, on the city street, you know, wherever you are.”\nWhile Allie is an active birder, she’s happy to take along her friends and family, who aren’t as experienced.\nLast May, she brought her friend, Anni Trentham, to Rock Creek Park in D.C., and the two searched for birds.\nLast summer, she visited Alaska with her family and was amazed at the wildlife there. She and her cousins were walking along a trail when she saw a belted kingfisher hunting for fish in the river. Allie was thrilled.\n“I spent like, five or 10 minutes watching this belted kingfisher. And my cousins left me behind because I was just staring at this belted kingfisher,” Judge said.\nWhile it wasn’t the rarest bird, Allie loved seeing the belted kingfisher thrive in the natural landscape with all the other wildlife.\nShe encourages anyone interested in birding just to go out there and do it. It’s incredible to be out in nature and see what you can find.\n“It is so rewarding to become interested in something like birding or in the natural world, and it always gives back to you in terms of the amazing things you can see out there,” Judge said.\nDon’t be afraid to be curious about the wildlife beyond your front door."

    "title": "Lawsuit accuses Maryland-based disability claims firm of unlawful practices",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  A recent lawsuit filed on behalf of veterans alleges that Just4Veterans, a Clarksburg, Maryland-based disability claims consultancy that operates nationally, is violating federal law. \nThe company is accused of operating without the required Veterans Administration accreditation and imposing consulting fees that are illegally excessive.\nThe lawsuit, filed in Circuit Court for Montgomery County by the Pels Law Firm in Bethesda, Maryland, alleges that Just4Veterans charged Air Force veteran Grant Gallagher, of San Antonio, Texas, a fee of more than $7,000, five times the increase in his monthly disability benefits that the firm helped him obtain.\nIn a text message to Capital News Service, Just4Veterans owner Frederick Castanos Justo declined to comment on the lawsuit against him and his company but added: “Gallagher has an outstanding invoice to my company,” he said. “This is under investigation and I will see him in court to collect his outstanding debt.”   \n\n\n    \n  \n\n    Download the CNS app from the Apple Store or Google Play\n  \n\nGallagher joined the Air Force in March 2016 as an information technology specialist, was “ deployed in support of special operations units in Africa and received recognition (coined) by the seal team 10 commander,” Gallagher told CNS in written responses to questions. \nAs of August 2022, 4.9 million veterans   27% of all veterans, had a service-connected disability, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\nThe Veterans Benefits Administration last year processed over 1.7 million claims related to disability compensation and pensions for veterans, setting a new record for the VA and exceeding the prior years record by 12%. \nMany veterans have complained that the system is overly cumbersome and confusing.  \nThe lawsuit against Just4Veterans claims that “Justo relies on his personal status as a veteran to gain other veterans’ trust and to entice other veterans to enter into contracts with Just4Veterans.”\nAfter Gallagher had been out of the service for nearly a year, on February 23, he entered into a contract with Just4Veterans to help him obtain an increase in his VA disability rate from 90% to 100% disabled. \n“The contract was for ‘coaching services’ and I felt rushed by the guy I was talking to into signing the contract,” Gallagher said.  “I was ‘pitched’ that they can help me get to 100% VA disabled.”\nDocuments from the lawsuit show that on April 15, Gallagher was billed $7,426.95, and then asked to pay a lump sum payment of $6,878.09, which included “a 10% discount.” \nOn April 25, Gallagher had made a payment of $742.69, followed by another payment of $300.00 on July 1.  \n“This worked out to be an approx $7,500 fee when in reality they likely spent less than four hours worth of work,” Gallagher wrote. “They are not accredited and I feel like they are preying on veterans.”\nGallagher also said he is uncomfortable knowing the firm has personal information about him. \n“Additionally due to the nature of the information they have about me… I certainly felt uneasy about them possibly using that info against me in a malicious way and I have had a couple PTSD anxiety attacks around this thought,” Gallagher said. \nAccording to the Just4Veterans website, owner Justo is a retired veteran who served in the U.S. Marine Corps for 23 years.\n“Recognizing the need to provide Veterans help in processing their VA disability claims, Fred has started Just4Veterans to aid veterans get the highest VA rating possible,” the company’s website states. \nAccording to the Just4Veterans contract with Gallagher attached as part of the lawsuit, “J4V does NOT assist Client with the preparation, presentation, and prosecution of his/her VA disability claims for VA benefits. Client shall prepare and file his/her own claim utilizing free government websites.” \nContrary to what’s outlined in the contract, Gallagher said he had a different experience.\n“I had all my documentation ready to go so they basically just organized it, told me what to claim, and had me log into my VA.gov account, then submitted my own documents as me via a zoom call where they took control over my mouse,” Gallagher explained. “This didnt feel right to me when it was happening but I didnt realize this was illegal for them to do.”\nAn increasing number of veterans organizations have complained recently about firms that charge exorbitant rates for claims assistance. \nCongress has also heard testimony about the rise of so-called “claim sharks”  companies that charge more than legally permitted for preparing VA claim documents. \n “Veterans seeking to access their benefits should not face another battle to do so,” Rep. Chris Pappas, D-New Hampshire, said in a statement in February. \nHe reintroduced the Governing Unaccredited Representatives Defrauding (GUARD) VA Benefits Act, which would impose penalties on non-accredited firms. \n“Unfortunately, unaccredited, for-profit companies are scamming veterans of their earned benefits under the guise of helping them, and they must be stopped and held accountable,” Pappas charged. \nRep. Brian Fitzpatrick, R-Pennsylvania, one of the co-sponsors of the bill, said that for too long, heinous actors have taken advantage of and preyed upon veterans in need of assistance, without consequences, and this practice must end.\nIn April 2022, Ryan Galluci, the executive director of the Washington office of Veterans of Foreign Wars, shared his concerns over non-accredited consulting groups targeting veterans before a subcommittee of the House Veterans Affairs Committee. \nCertain predatory companies have used the confusion created by the COVID-19 pandemic to infiltrate networks of veterans in need, and have grown by more than six hundred percent in the last two years alone, Galluci said.\nHe added that based on the VFWs long-term observations of these companies, its evident that they have no intention of complying with existing regulations. \nRather than focusing on altering the VA accreditation system to favor these unethical companies, the committee should prioritize enforcing penalties for those who blatantly breach VA guidelines, according to Galluci.\nJon Pels, a Bethesda-based lawyer representing Gallagher, told CNS that “what is ironic about what we believe the defendants will argue in these cases is…they are not accredited and therefore they can charge whatever they want.”\n“However, to assist disabled veterans you need to be accredited,” Pels said. “So it is a very circular argument. It would be like somebody charging illegal and excessive fees as an attorney to a worker’s compensation client but then arguing, ‘well I’m not a licensed attorney so I can charge whatever I want.’”  \nIn early September, an employee of Just4Veterans, who called himself  Coach Sion, sent a text message to Gallagher. According to the text message attached in the lawsuit, Sion threatened to contact Gallagher’s employer and to bring legal action against him if he refused to pay the fees. \n“My goal is to prevent this from requiring legal action which will result in additional fee’s (sic.) being added to your invoice as well as court cost. We will also reach to (sic.) your employer to discuss garnishment actions,” the text said. \nThe text also said that “as Military Veterans one of the most important traits is INTEGRITY which comes along with trust.” The text added that “this is a legal binding contract which will be enforced through legal matters if required.” \nThe lawsuit alleges Just4Veterans is aware that charging veterans fees for any assistance with claims for VA disability benefits by unaccredited organizations is illegal.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER \n“Defendants contort the language on their website and in their contract(s) to make it seem that they are not assisting veterans and charging illegal fees,” the lawsuit says.\nThe suit points to the company contract, attached as part of the lawsuit, which clearly states that ”J4V is NOT accredited VSO, VA claims agent, or attorney. J4V does NOT represent the Client before the VA as an advocate or a legal representative and does not provide legal advice. While J4V may provide practical, legal, and educational advice in certain situations, Client acknowledges that this is NOT legal advice in any way.” \nHowever, the lawsuit says, the Just4Veterans website suggests otherwise: “Helping Veterans to Get the Benefits They Deserve,” it states in bold blue letters. \n“Just4Veterans VA claims assistance will walk you through every step of the application process,” the website states under “Our Services.”\nThere are 30 “veteran coaches” with the company, including Justo, most of whom say they are retired Marines working for Just4Veterans, according to the website. \n“Fred lived with his mission to help veterans…He gave an opportunity on (sic.) other Veterans who he shared the same values with to be a coach to other veterans in need,” the company’s website says.\nPels, in an interview, recommended that veterans in need of claims help should consult reputable veteran organizations like the VFW for recommendations on lawyers or service providers.\nGallagher said the experience left him with “a terrible feeling.” \n“To feel ‘used’ by a company that proudly boasts about being ‘for the veteran’ is a terrible feeling and hurts, to feel like after you just gave a part of yourself for our country that people are so quick to try and profit off you and your entitlements,” he said.  \n“I hope companies like this disappear for good and we can get more funding for VSOs (Veterans Service Organizations) who can actually help veterans get the benefits they earned through their sacrifice to our country without ripping them off,” Gallagher said."

    "title": "Anne Arundel County gets $400,000 to help youths get back on track after low-level offenses",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  Maryland lawmakers secured $400,000 in funding last month for an Anne Arundel County-based diversion program for youths accused of low-level offenses.\nThe program is called Fresh START (which stands for Fresh Safe, Trauma-Informed, Accountable, Restorative, Transparent).\nMaryland Democratic Sens. Ben Cardin and Chris Van Hollen, as well as Maryland Democratic Reps. Steny Hoyer and John Sarbanes, secured the funding through the Department of Justice’s Byrne Discretionary Grants Program.\nFresh START began in 2021 and at the time was one of the only programs of its kind in the country.\nHere is how it works: When an Anne Arundel County police officer responds to a low-level offense committed by a minor, the officer can refer the minor to the program. Minors who complete the program do not get a criminal record.\nBy contrast, most other diversion programs only are started after the minor has been charged, according to Anne Arundel County Sgt. Stephanie Hinson.\nThe 90-day Fresh START program begins with a one-on-one meeting with parents or guardians to try to figure out certain factors that could have contributed to the minor committing the crime, such as troubles at home, at school, past trauma or mental health issues.\n“They’re more than just that incident,” Hinson said.\nThose going through the program range from 13 to 18 years old and the majority are African American, said Carol Parreco, program manager for Fresh START. The officers act as mentors to the teenagers in the program.\nThe new funding will go towards expanding the different components that are offered with Fresh START and forming more partnerships with local businesses like restaurants and faith-based groups.\nOne of the components in Fresh START is called “School of Charm,” where the teenagers in the program are able to learn life skills like financial literacy, interviewing and writing resumes, as well as proper grooming and even dining etiquette. At the end of the course, the teens go shopping with a sponsor to buy professional clothes they can wear to networking events or interviews, Parreco said.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER \nAnother course called “Badges for Books” teaches literacy and critical thinking skills. For children who are too young to be charged with an offense but have shown signs of troubling behavior, they can still be referred to the program.\nMany of the teens who successfully complete the program keep in touch with officers and come back to visit into adulthood, Parreco said.\n“We want them to see that it’s not just their family that cares about them; its the police department, it’s the community members, everybody that we partner with on the outside  theyre all rallying for these kids,” Parreco said.\nIn a statement, Van Hollen commended the program’s “strong record of putting young people who committed minor offenses back on the right track.”\nCardin also praised the program, saying in a statement that it will “spare families and young people from the heartbreak often caused by routine offending.”\nUpholding accountability, reducing ethnic and racial disparities in the justice system, and promoting better outcomes for at-risk youth, the Fresh START program is crucial to the safety and prosperity of our community, Hoyer said in a statement."

    "title": "Maryland&#8217;s Cardin vows to halt military aid to Egypt over human rights abuses",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  Sen. Ben Cardin, D-Maryland, the newly-appointed chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, has announced plans to block future U.S. military aid and arms sales to Egypt unless that country shows concrete, meaningful, and sustainable steps to improve its human rights record.\nIt is imperative that we continue to hold the government of Egypt, and all governments, accountable for their human rights violations, Cardin said in a statement.\nCardins decision marks a significant shift in U.S. policy towards Egypt, a long-standing ally in the Middle East. The senator plans to block $235 million in foreign military assistance that the Biden administration approved on September 14. \nThe move starkly contrasts with the actions of Cardin’s predecessor, Sen. Bob Menendez, D-New Jersey, who was indicted Sept. 22 for allegedly accepting bribes to influence U.S. policy in favor of the Egyptian government.\nCardin’s action is colliding with the Biden administration’s efforts to foster closer ties with Egypt. \nState Department spokesman Vedant Patel said in a press briefing Wednesday that the United States aims to advance a strategic partnership with Egypt that ensures regional security and fosters significant progress on human rights issues.\nPatel added that Secretary of State Antony Blinken believes waiving certain conditions for Egypts foreign military financing in fiscal 2022 aligned with U.S. national security interests. \nA total of $1.215 billion in military aid has been allocated for Egypt and discussions with Congress and Egyptian partners are ongoing, Patel said.\n“I was very open in my disappointment in the administration using the waiver on the use of funds, but I want to have a chance to meet with the administration,” Cardin told Politico. \nBefore assuming his current role, Cardin had criticized the Biden administration for overriding a human rights prohibition on $320 million of military aid to Egypt. \nHe was among a group of senators, including independent Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Chris Murphy of Connecticut, Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, Sherrod Brown of Ohio, Dick Durbin of Illinois, Jeff Merkley of Oregon, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Tim Kaine of Virginia, Tom Carper of Delaware that urged the Biden administration to withhold the $320 million from Egypt. \nThe senators argued that the Egyptian government had failed to make meaningful progress in addressing human rights concerns and that withholding the funds was required by law in the fiscal 2022 spending bill.\nIn a July 28 letter to Blinken, the senators charged that the Egyptian government had not only failed to investigate allegations of human rights abuses, it has also continued to commit significant human rights’ violations such as extrajudicial killings, enforced disappearance, torture and life-threatening prison conditions, and severe restrictions on freedoms of expression, assembly, and association, as documented in the State Department’s latest human rights report.\nAccording to Amnesty International, Egyptian authorities severely restrict civil liberties, including freedom of expression and assembly. \nIn the lead-up to the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP27) in November 2022, 895 political prisoners were released but nearly triple that number were arrested, according to Amnesty International.\nSexual and gender-based violence remained prevalent, amid the authorities’ failure to adequately prevent and punish it, Amnesty International said. Workers rights and religious freedoms are also suppressed, and refugees are mistreated.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER \nThe decision to freeze aid could have geopolitical implications.  \nAs a result of the aid hold, “the anti-America(n) camp will be empowered domestically,” Haisam Hassanein, an adjunct fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, told Jewish Insider. \nHe predicted that the group would publicly push for Egypt to strengthen its relations with Russia and China.\n“This could force President (Abdel Fattah El-) Sisi in his current election campaign to release some (inflammatory) statements to save face in front of his constituents,” Hassanein said. \nOn Wednesday, Cardin also announced plans to halt security assistance to Azerbaijan due to its brutal campaign in the Nagorno-Karabakh region, effectively erasing its Armenian population.\nCardin emphasized the need to document war crimes and atrocities and to support efforts to repatriate prisoners of war.\nHe called for increased humanitarian support for ethnic Armenians who have left Nagorno-Karabakh and for the United States to continue supporting democratic reforms in Armenia."

    "content": "WASHINGTON – Maryland is seeing a surge in COVID cases that mirrors national trends — and experts say it might continue as the state heads into respiratory disease season and as some residents take lax approaches to preventive measures.\nThe rate of reported COVID-19 cases in the state saw an uptick during September. Sept. 11 saw the highest recorded case rate last month in Maryland, with 6.64 cases per 100,000 people.

Case rates last month ranged from 4.54 to 6.64 cases per 100,000 people, meaning this year’s numbers look better than last year’s.\nBut Kate McPhaul, an associate research professor in the University of Maryland’s School of Public Health, said the prevalence of testing is lower now than earlier in the pandemic.\nAmid the September surge, President Joe Biden’s administration also announced on Sept. 20 that it is appropriating $600 million to companies that produce COVID-19 testing kits to boost the number of tests manufactured in the nation.\nThe same day, the administration announced that all households in the country can request four free rapid-testing kits through covid.gov/tests. Free COVID-19 tests previously were available via mail from January 2022 until June of this year.\nMcPhaul warned that despite a resurgence in testing options, current case numbers may not be entirely accurate because fewer people overall are testing and milder cases have likely not all been reported to the state.\nHowever, there’s a general indication that there has been a surge in recent weeks — including through anecdotal evidence, she said.\nThis fall surge indicates that COVID-19 could be showing signs of spiking seasonally, McPhaul said, but since it is still a relatively new virus, predicting its behavior is difficult.\nIn line with the surge in cases, hospitalizations and deaths in Maryland have also increased between the start of summer and now, state health department data shows.\nThese upticks will likely continue in the coming months, according to Kristen Coleman, an assistant professor in the University of Maryland’s public health school.\nColeman said that reinstating preventive measures like masking and air filtration in public spaces, classrooms and more could help keep the surge at bay.\n“I expect that [cases] will continue to climb,” Coleman said. “This fall, because of the uptick, I do see more people masking, but certainly not as many as in the beginning of the pandemic.”\nA poll by the business intelligence company Morning Consult in May showed that only 24% of all United States adults were “very” concerned about COVID-19. It’s a number that’s steadily declined since the start of the pandemic. In April 2020, comparatively, 65% of adults told Morning Consult they were “very concerned.”\nFor McPhaul, this decline in concern is evident through a drop in people masking and seeking out the most recent booster dose of the COVID-19 vaccine.\n“People want the pandemic to be over with and to me right now, it seems like there's a bit of a disconnect with the COVID rate going up. A lot of the behaviors that mitigate getting sick kind of don't seem to be happening,” McPhaul said.\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration in mid-September approved an updated COVID-19 booster vaccine that targets newer variants that have been fueling a rise in cases. But this booster has not been widely administered, McPhaul said.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER \nOnly 24% of Maryland’s population has received an updated bivalent booster vaccine at all, according to the Centers for Disease Control. Additional tracking shows that few residents in the region and nationally have received the most recent booster dose.\nIn addition to the case surge in Maryland, Virginia and the District of Columbia also are seeing similar trends and similar attitudes when it comes to masking and vaccines.\nBetween the beginning of August and mid-September, the Virginia Department of Health recorded an uptick in reported COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations for COVID-19. In all except four of Virginia’s 139 counties and independent cities, fewer than 25% of residents have received all the CDC-recommended doses of the COVID-19 vaccine, according to data from the department.\nNumbers across the past month in Washington, D.C., also align with national trends. The rate of weekly reported cases per 100,000 city residents saw a steady uptick from 11.7 cases on Aug. 19 to 33.6 cases on Sept. 9, D.C. Health data shows.\nAs cases may continue rising in the region, McPhaul encouraged area residents to think about preventive measures in their communities, including masking around high-risk individuals and getting vaccinated against COVID-19 and other respiratory diseases like the flu and RSV (respiratory syncytial virus).\n“I think people just need to get that person in their head that they're protecting,” she said. “All of that stuff that we were promoting during the pandemic can continue to be utilized in the prevention of all of the airborne infections.”"

    "title": "Speaker fight fallout: Pelosi, Maryland’s Hoyer lose Capitol hideaways",
    "content": "WASHINGTON – Rep. Steny Hoyer, D-Maryland, and House Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi, D-California, were evicted Tuesday from their United States Capitol hideaway offices in the aftermath of the ousting of former Speaker Kevin McCarthy.\nThe ejection of Hoyer and Pelosi from their hideaway offices was one of the first acts of the new interim speaker, Rep. Patrick McHenry, R-North Carolina.\nHoyer’s communications team confirmed reports that he was ordered out of his hideaway, but declined any further comment on the matter in a statement to Capital News Service.\nA veteran of the House since 1981, Hoyer twice has served as House majority leader: from 2007 until 2011 and 2019 until January of this year.\nPelosi, who was speaker until January when the Republican majority took charge, was not able to move her things out of her hideaway herself because she was in California for Sen. Dianne Feinstein’s funeral. Feinstein, the longest-serving female senator in U.S. history, died last week at age 90.\n\n“Office space doesn’t matter to me, but it seems to be important to them,” Pelosi said in a statement. Now that the new Republican Leadership has settled this important matter, let’s hope they get to work on what’s truly important for the American people.”\n“Sadly, because I am in California to mourn the loss of and pay tribute to my dear friend Dianne Feinstein, I am unable to retrieve my belongings at this time, ” she said.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER \nThe former speaker said the “eviction is a sharp departure from tradition,” and noted that she gave former speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Illinois, “a significantly larger suite of offices for as long as he wished.”\nHowever, Pelosi deviated from custom as well when she was speaker and revoked Mike Pence’s House office space while he was the vice president, instead giving it to the White House legislative affairs team.\nBoth Pelosi and Hoyer occupied large suites of offices in the Capitol when they were in their leadership posts.\nCapitol hideaways became a tradition and treasured perk as Congress expanded in size and lawmakers desired more space and privacy to conduct their work. All current senior lawmakers have their own assigned hideaways, but the location of these offices are meant to be kept secret, as are who works in each one.\nThese discreet offices  behind unmarked doors  are often used by lawmakers to meet with staff and colleagues, to find a quiet place to rest, or to speak about delicate matters without fear of being overheard. Hideaways have become less secret in recent years as some senators and House members have allowed their staffs to work and hold small meetings in the private spaces.\nHoyer and Pelosi both will continue to maintain their larger offices in the Longworth House Office Building across from the Capitol."

    "title": "Washington’s Art Museum of the Americas features transgender and nonbinary works",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  An exhibit at the Art Museum of the Americas is shining a light on challenges that transgender and nonbinary people face throughout Latin America, while also trying to promote change.\nThe exhibit, titled “As We Are,” features 10 works by transgender and nonbinary artists from member states such as Chile, Panama, Argentina and Mexico. The works were chosen after an open call for artists on social media.\nThe museum worked with another program of the Organization of American States, the Universal Civil Identity Program in the Americas, also known by its Spanish acronym PUICA, to create the exhibit.\nPUICA helps to provide legal identification for people in the Americas, and has created projects to aid transgender and nonbinary people. PUICA reached out to the museum to find a way to better show the stories and lived experiences of the transgender and nonbinary community, said Museum Director Adriana Ospina.\nThe museum launched an open call for entries, requiring the art to be two-dimensional and to be created by people from the transgender or nonbinary community.\nWASHINGTON  Some of the works in the As We Are exhibit at the Art Museum of the Americas. (Minnie Stephenson/Capital News Service)\nThe museum selected a winner, a video piece titled “Mil Sucesos perdidos hasta ahora,” or “A Thousand Events Lost Until Now,” by Argentinian artists Duen Sacchi and Mag De Santo, who call their duo “Rio Paraná.” Funding from Synergia, a human rights organization, allowed the museum to award the artists $5,000.\n“They presented testimonials of different people (who are) part of the transgender community around the Americas and the difficulties they face daily in terms of access to health, access to their own communities and difficulties of living in certain regions of the continent,” Ospina said.\nIn the exhibit, an entire wall is dedicated to the video piece, with three projectors showcasing different people from the transgender and nonbinary community. The entire presentation is 40 minutes long.\nSacchi and De Santo wanted to show the creativity of the transgender community and invited their friends from Argentina, Colombia and Mexico to present their stories\n“Our efforts were directed at not reducing our lives to mere existence…But that we have an important contribution to the ​​construction of poetics in contemporary art,” Sacchi and De Santo wrote in an email translated into English.\nThe exhibit also features nine other works, including “Underdog” by Laya Monarez. Monarez is a transgender artist who is Mexican-American and Indigenous and lives in Washington.\nShe said she started the painting years ago, but was inspired to finish it after a friend told her about the museum’s call for entries.\nThe painting depicts a post-apocalyptic scene where a large, evil robot is destroying everything in its path. A little robot in the foreground of the painting has a transgender flag on it and is holding a slingshot. The large robot represents society and its ability to overpower the transgender community. But the transgender community, represented by the little robot, still stands strong amidst the hostility, Monarez said.\n“I wanted to kind of uplift us (the transgender community) a little bit and kind of show us that, you know, were a little robot but were still powerful,” Monarez said.\nThe little robot’s slingshot is a reference to David’s slingshot in the story of David and Goliath.\nThe art in the exhibit represents an expression of gender identity, but so does someone’s legal identification, said Rebeca Omaña, coordinator of PUICA. Since 2019, PUICA has been working with countries in Latin America to change their identification systems to be more inclusive of the transgender and nonbinary community.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER \n“The problem we (face) with transgender people is that those documents many times dont reflect who they are,” Omaña said.\nOver the past four years, PUICA has been able to train over 400 civil servants across Latin America to better handle transgender and nonbinary citizens, and has also reviewed legislation in those countries as well.\nSince starting this work, nine states in Mexico have created a way for transgender people to change their legal identities. Smaller changes have occurred in countries like Uruguay and Argentina, who are still in the process of changing their laws.\n“We understand that not every country is going to change their legislation or their procedures but they are starting to look at what they can do,” Omaña said.\nOspina said the exhibit has been very popular since it opened in late July. While the exhibit is the first of its kind, Ospina said she wants to continue to create more inclusive exhibits to make the museum “a safe space for everyone.”\nThe exhibit is open until Oct. 8."

    "title": "Raskin leads effort to recognize Banned Books Week",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Maryland, and Sen. Brian Schatz, D-Hawaii, introduced a bill Wednesday calling for the national recognition of Banned Books Week, which is Oct. 1-7, and the condemnation of banning books in school libraries.\nThe bill recommends that local governments and schools “protect the rights of students to learn and the ability of educators and librarians to teach” and calls for upholding the First Amendment but does not include a unified national protocol for dealing with book bans.\nYou know, the proper response to hating a book in a free society is you dont read the book, Raskin said at a Capitol Hill press conference Wednesday.\nThe bill, which has 40 co-sponsors in the House and 15 in the Senate, echoes bills the lawmakers introduced in the last session of Congress but neither measure passed.\nInstances of book banning increased by 33% from the 2021-2022 school year to the 2022-2023 school year, according to the nonprofit PEN America. Books such as “The Bluest Eye” by Toni Morrison and “Gender Queer: A Memoir” by Maia Kobabe repeatedly have been targeted by critics. Many titles that receive so-called requests for review involve themes of race, sexuality and sexual abuse.\nBetween July 1, 2022 and June 30, there were 3,362 instances of book banning in public libraries and in schools, according to PEN America.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER \nFlorida accounted for 40% of the book bans. Top states where book bans were instituted were Texas, Utah, Missouri and Pennsylvania.\nThe Senate Judiciary Committee earlier this month held a hearing on book bans, where senators and five witnesses discussed balancing the freedom of speech of parents and taxpayers with those of students, teachers and librarians. The hearing also examined book ban policies at the state and local level.\nThe debate did not include the introduction of federal policies on book bans nor a tangible, federal solution. Sen. John Kennedy, R-Louisiana, asked witnesses Cameron Samuels, a student at Brandeis University and co-founder of Students Engaged in Advancing Texas, and Illinois Secretary of State Alexi Giannoulias to provide a clear solution; neither did.\n“The discussion we’ve been having… for me, it’s a little too conceptual, or I don’t know, metaphysical,” Kennedy said.\nThe federal government has not passed legislation to create a unified procedure on book bans. Book ban and review policies and decisions are currently made at the local government level.\nOn June 12, Illinois passed a law that makes libraries that ban books ineligible for state-funded grants. It is the first state in the country to take such action and could pave the way for future federal legislation.\n“Its my hope that other states, that others may look toward Illinois and see the value in adopting our legislation as a model to stop banning books in its tracks and to protect the right to read freely without fear of retribution,” Giannoulias said at the legislation’s signing."

    "title": "With no breakthroughs as government faces shutdown Saturday, impacts would be widespread",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  A looming federal government shutdown would have severe implications for a range of critical services, programs and benefits that impact millions of Americans.\nMany government functions will halt at midnight on Saturday unless there is a breakthrough in an impasse among House Republicans who are fighting over the size of spending bills, funding additional border measures and providing U.S. aid to Ukraine. Thursday brought no signs of a settlement.\nHouse Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., insisted Thursday that there would be a deal.\n“At the end of the day, we will get this done,” he said on CNBC’s “Squawk Box.”\nA frustrated Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, warned House Republicans Thursday that “shutting down the government is not like pressing pause. It’s not an interlude that lets us pick up where we left off.”\n“It’s an actively harmful proposition,” the GOP leader said. “And instead of producing any meaningful policy outcomes, it would actually take the important progress being made on a number of key issues and drag it backward.”\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-New York, is pressing for passage of a stopgap spending bill that would keep the government open while disputes over longer-term spending can be resolved. He said McCarthy has backed away from the June budget deal crafted between congressional leaders and the Biden administration.\n“Despite the fact that many on both sides want to work together, despite the fact that here in the Senate we are pursuing bipartisanship, the speaker has chosen to elevate the whims and desires of a handful of hard-right extremists, and has nothing to show for it,” Schumer said.\nSen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Maryland, said in a statement that senators “are working on a bipartisan basis to keep the government running, while MAGA Republicans in the House are putting politics over people and driving us straight towards a shameful – and avoidable – shutdown.\nDuring the (2019) Trump shutdown, I heard directly from Marylanders who were struggling to get the services they need and make ends meet, Van Hollen said. From our military members, first responders, and government employees to our seniors and most vulnerable – there’s not a person in our state that won’t feel the impact of a shutdown in one way or another.\nA government shutdown would interrupt discretionary spending, which is about 27% of federal spending. The rest, considered mandatory spending, would carry on. Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security and the U.S. Postal Service would not be affected by a shutdown.\nThe chairwoman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Sen. Patty Murray, D-Washington, said Wednesday that “there is no reason for any senator to weaponize Senate procedures and force a totally unnecessary shutdown. She added that working Americans would bear the brunt of the consequences of a shutdown. Additionally, the financial toll of a shutdown would be far greater than the cost of maintaining government operations.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER \nGoldman Sachs estimated that a shutdown would shave off 0.2% of economic growth for every week it persists.\nThe effects would not just be limited to federal workers; the ripple effect would also disrupt businesses closely connected to the federal government, such as federal contractors or tourist services near national parks.\nThe nations most vulnerable populations also face the prospect of lost or delayed support.\nThe shutdown effort is being championed by far-right Republicans directed by former President Donald Trump, Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Maryland, charged during a Thursday hearing by the House Oversight and Reform Committee.\n“Trump’s convinced that if we shut the government down, his four criminal prosecutions on 91 different felony and misdemeanor charges will be defunded and delayed long enough to keep him having to go before a jury of his peers before the 2024 election,” Raskin said. And like flying monkeys on a mission for the Wicked Witch of the West, Trumps followers in the House now carry his messages out to the world: shut down the government, shut down the prosecutions.”\n!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r=0;r\n\nHow a shutdown would affect the nation: \n\nThe shutdown would halt the pay of millions of federal workers across the nation. Many of the 2 million civilian workers, ranging from U.S. Park Police officers to Social Security Administration employees, would encounter delayed paychecks. Over 138,000 federal civilian workers are located in Maryland.\nNon-essential federal workers and contractors would be furloughed. Other federal workers who are considered essential or “excepted” would continue working during the shutdown. Once the government re-opens, federal workers usually get paid retroactively. Yet the pay of contractors is more uncertain because they don’t have the same protections as full-time federal workers.\nActive-duty service members in the United States and abroad would work without pay. Of these 1.3 million active-duty service members, 53% are married and 39% have children, according to the National Library of Medicine. There are 29,500 active-duty service members in Maryland.\nThe Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), a federally-funded program to help low-income mothers with young children purchase food, would stop receiving funding and would soon run out of money. This means participants would experience reduced or no benefits. According to the USDA, there were 6.3 million WIC participants in 2022, including 118,783 in Maryland.\nHead Start, the federally-funded program that helps prepare children from low-income families for school, would not receive grants during the shutdown. This would result in the immediate loss of access to the program by 10,000 children, according to a statement from the White House.\nThe National Institutes of Health would have to delay new clinical trials for diseases such as cancer, preventing patients from receiving new treatments.\nThe Environmental Protection Agency would cease most inspections at hazardous waste sites, chemical facilities and drinking water facilities.\nLong-term recovery funding from FEMA’s Disaster Relief Fund would be halted, including 12 recovery projects in Hawaii, according to a White House press release. This could potentially harm citizens still recovering from recent disasters. It could also set back community preparedness for future disasters. In Maryland, they would press pause on 11 projects.\n\nHow a shutdown would impact the economy:\n\nGoldman Sachs estimates a government-wide shutdown would directly reduce economic growth by about “0.15 percentage point for each week it lasted, or about 0.2 percentage point per week once private sector effects were included.”\nStill, Goldman Sachs projects that in the quarter after the government would reopen, “the growth would rise by the same cumulative amount.”\nSince federal workers would not receive paychecks, local economies would be impacted, Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack said Monday. For example, a Goldman Sachs survey showed two out of five Americans cut their spending during the 2014 government shutdown, which lasted a little over two weeks.\nAs for the travel economy, the shutdown would cost $140 million daily, according to new research from the U.S. Travel Association, which said air travelers would face more “flight delays, longer screening lines and setbacks in air travel modernization.”\nThe Small Business Administration would stop reviewing or accepting applications for any new business loans, impacting funding for small businesses across the nation.\n\nFunctions that would not be affected by a shutdown: \n\nThe U.S. Postal Service would continue operations, including mail and package deliveries. USPS is funded through the sale of postage stamps or other postal products and services.\nPeople would still receive Social Security checks, Medicare and Medicaid, but some services, such as the issuance of new Medicare cards, would be halted.\nPassport services and consular services would still continue as normal. However, if a shutdown persists for many days, these services could take longer.\nVeterans’ benefits and pensions would still be paid and the Department of Veterans Affairs would retain most of its employees.\nThe president and members of Congress would continue working, but any non-essential employees would be furloughed.\nThe judiciary would continue to operate for at least two weeks with money collected from court fees and other sources of money not dependent on government funding. This would not impact current federal investigations such as those involving Trump.\nSeveral federal agencies, such as the Department of Justice and the Department of Homeland Security, have contingency plans in place if funding runs out, but only to keep on essential personnel for critical jobs.\nEmployees in the Department of Transportation, such as Air Traffic controllers would still show up for work, but would not be paid until funding is restored.\nPopular federally-managed tourist destinations, such as the Smithsonian Institution’s museums and the National Zoo in Washington ,would close, as would national forests. But the National Park Service might keep monuments and hiking trails open on a limited basis as it did in the last shutdown in 2018, with no guided tours or access to bathrooms.\n\n“Shutting down the government isn't good for anyone. The American people want off this ride,” Sen. Ben Cardin, D-Maryland, tweeted. “We have an obligation to get these bills passed.”"

Bob Menendez to resign over corruption charges.\n“As a public servant, he has a duty to uphold the standard of public trust and to protect the integrity of the institution of the Senate and, for those reasons, it is best that he step down,” Van Hollen said in a statement.\nMaryland’s other senator, Democrat Ben Cardin, so far has not moved beyond a statement Friday, saying people should “allow the legal process to move forward without prejudice.”\nMenendez and his wife, Nadine, were indicted on federal bribery charges for allegedly accepting hundreds of thousands of dollars and gold bars to secretly aid the Egyptian government, and to benefit business associates in New Jersey, according to court documents filed on Friday. The couple pleaded not guilty Wednesday in federal court in New York.\nThe charges include conspiracy to commit bribery, conspiracy to commit honest services fraud and conspiracy to commit extortion under color of official right. Last year, the FBI found $480,000 and 13 gold bars in Menendez’s home, according to court documents. The indictment also alleges that the couple received a luxury car as a bribe.\nDuring his time in the Senate, Menendez oversaw billions of dollars in aid to Egypt as the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee.\nIn 2015, Menendez was indicted on bribery charges, but the case ended in a mistrial.\nMenendez has stepped down from the foreign relations panel and Cardin is serving as temporary chairman.\nAs of Wednesday afternoon, 28 Senate Democrats and independent Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont had called for Menendez to step down.\nVan Hollen said he has seen Menendez work hard for the people of New Jersey, but called the charges against him “serious, specific, and deeply concerning.”\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER \n“(Menendez) has a duty to uphold the standard of public trust and to protect the integrity of the institution of the Senate,” Van Hollen said.\nCardin’s office on Wednesday referred Capital News Service to his statement issued Friday, in which he talked about his relationship with Menendez. The pair served almost a decade together in the House before they became senators.\n“He has left his mark on American diplomacy and national security as a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and, especially, as Chair,” Cardin said.\n“Senator Menendez has a right to respond aggressively in court to the current charges, and I am confident that he will do so,” he said.\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-New York, said that Menendez will address the Democrats in a private meeting Thursday."

    "title": "Heartbroken parents warn of the dangers of subway surfing, an online trend",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  In late June, the body of 15-year-old Jay Thirunarayanapuram, a student and artist at Albert Einstein High School in Montgomery County, Maryland, was discovered near the Rhode Island Avenue-Brentwood Metro Station.\nWashington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority investigators informed his parents that he fell from a moving train while filming himself attempting a dangerous activity known as subway surfing.\nNamed for a popular video game, subway surfing is the act of riding on top or in between rapid transit cars. The dangerous practice is part of a more significant social media trend known as urban exploration or #urbex.\nOn sites like Instagram or TikTok, users document themselves exploring abandoned properties and off-limits areas such as roofs and subways. The urban exploration trend first appeared online in 2007 and grew into a loose-knit community of people. \nThirunarayanapuram was one of them.\nHe would like to use Instagram all the time, and it is through Instagram that he actually started following the dangerous trend of urban exploration which eventually ended in so much tragedy for us and for him,” Jay’s mother, Vaishali Honawar told Capital News Service in a telephone interview. \nWASHINGTON  Jay Thirunarayanapuram, a student and artist at Albert Einstein High School in Montgomery County, Maryland, was killed while subway surfing. (Photo courtesy of Vaishali Honawar and Desikan Thirunarayanapuram)\nInitially, he joined a site where people posted going to elicit abandoned buildings. Ultimately, he kind of graduated from all that into train surfing, Jay’s father, Desikan Thirunarayanapuram, told CNS.\nYoung people are particularly susceptible to dangerous internet trends, according to an advisory report issued in May by U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy. The report warned that “extreme, inappropriate, and harmful content” is widely accessible to children and teens and that repeated exposure to this content can normalize risky behavior. \nBoth TikTok and Metas terms of service do not allow showing or promoting dangerous activities such as urban exploration, but a cursory search on TikTok and Instagram shows thousands of posts related to urban exploring.\nAfter his death, Honawar and Thirunarayanapuram gained access to Jay’s Instagram account and discovered that their son was active in the urban exploration community.\nWhen he posted his train surfing photos, he would get more likes than he normally did. So I think that certainly was a rush of people liking his scary adventures, his mother said. \nJay’s parents also discovered that their son was in constant contact with other young people, some as far away as New York City, discussing and encouraging urban exploration and subway surfing. \nThey would say to him, Youre a legend. And gave him these great compliments. So theres that sort of validation, a lot of it coming from the social media community, his mother said. \nIn exchanges with fellow urban explorers, his parents discovered, their son and his contacts knew the risks they were taking. Some had tragically lost their lives during such activities. \nHowever, the prevailing sentiment among the risk-takers was that the thrill was worth the danger, the parents said. In the event of a death, the urban exploring group believed it was to honor the memory of a person by continuing the exploration journey, the parents added.\nUnfortunately for Jay, his journey ended with his death. His parents, of course, are heartbroken. \nFor them, Jay’s memory lives on in the artwork he created, which hangs in their Silver Spring home, and in the people he touched, such as the teachers at his school. \n“He would stay after school and help them in their classrooms putting things away, he would chat with them,” Honawar said. \nJay’s parents said they had no idea their son was riding on top of trains and wanted to bring awareness to other parents about the dangers exposed to their children on social media. Their efforts have reached the halls of Congress.\nRep. Jamie Raskin, D-Maryland, called on Meta and TikTok to be more proactive in enforcing their guidelines on promoting and showing dangerous activities.\nUltimately, the government will have to act to deal with this if the social media companies do not, but theyve got the power right now, as well as the obligation to act, Raskin told CNS. \nWMATA has recorded five incidents of subway surfing on roofs of cars, with one resulting in Jay’s death and two resulting in injuries. \nThe tally does not include incidents of people riding between cars, which is extremely dangerous, and activity under the urban exploration-related hashtags on TikTok shows young people regularly riding between cars.\nThis year, incidents of subway surfing have been reported in Philadelphia, Chicago, Boston and New York City, where four young people died from injuries suffered while riding on top of subway cars. There were just five subway surfing deaths in New York City in the previous four years.  \nRaskin also sent a letter on Sept. 8 to WMATA urging additional steps to prevent urban exploration and to alert the community to the dangers of such activities with more significant public awareness efforts.  \nI am fearful that incidents of people riding on tops of Metro trains may be underreported, the congressman said in the letter. \nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER \nWMATA said in a statement to CNS that it shares concerns with Raskin and has been working with New York City Transit, where subway surfing is more common, as well as safety advocate groups, to discourage the trend.\nWhile Metro has fortunately not seen many of these incidents, we strongly condemn any form of this dangerous behavior, WMATA said. \nHowever, for Jay’s parents, his interactions with other young people participating in urban exploration indicates it is very much an issue in the Washington region. \n“It is absolutely present in the DC area. There are lots of people doing it,” Jay’s mother said. \nHonawar and Thirunarayanapuram are continuing their efforts to bring attention to subway surfing so that their tragedy doesn’t impact another family. \n“I really hope Metro will be a good member of the community and do something to stop people riding on trains, Jays mother said."

    "title": "In Washington, Zelenskyy makes pleas to Congress and the White House for more aid",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Thursday used face-to-face meetings with Congress and President Joe Biden to plead for additional U.S. military aid for his war-torn nation.\n“Today Im in Washington to strengthen our coalition to defend Ukrainian children, families, our homes, freedom and democracy in the world,” Zelenskyy told reporters as he stood with Biden in the White House’s Oval Office in the afternoon. It was Zelenskyy’s sixth meeting with Biden since the Russian invasion.\nEarlier, Zelenskyy said he had a “great dialogue” with senators in the United States Capitol, where he faced resistance from a faction of Senate and House Republicans that opposes further spending on humanitarian and military aid to Ukraine.\ndocument.createElement('video');\nhttps://cnsmaryland.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/trim_E63C8E80-BCA4-4E66-978D-BB7861E7215F.mp4\n\nBiden last month requested $40 billion from Congress in emergency spending, including $24 billion for Ukraine.\n“If we don’t get the aid, we will lose the war,” Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-New York, quoted Zelenskyy telling senators during a private meeting in the Old Senate Chamber.\nThe split within the Republican Party, especially in the House, on how to move forward with support for Ukraine is part of a larger debate about overall government spending that threatens to shut down many federal services when the fiscal year ends on Sept. 30.\nFar-right GOP lawmakers have refused to honor an earlier budget deal they agreed to and so far have refused to work with House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-California, to craft a compromise that would avoid a shutdown.\n“This is the worst possible time for House Republicans to be signaling that they are contemplating turning their back on Ukraine and handing that country to Vladimir Putin,” Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Connecticut, said in a leadership press conference Tuesday.\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Georgia, is one of the House members who opposes Ukraine aid and voted against moving ahead with an annual defense spending bill that traditionally has found broad bipartisan support.\n“Our country is being invaded by thousands every damn day and our Department of Defense does nothing,” Greene stated on X (formerly known as Twitter). “Our Defense bill should not fund our DOD for blood money for the Ukraine war, that’s why I’m a NO.”\n“I think its irresponsible to think about their country before I think about my country, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Kentucky, told Fox Business Thursday.\nPaul is one of 28 Republican members of Congress that published a letter on X Thursday opposing more aid to Ukraine.\nZelenskyy’s request to deliver an address to a joint session of Congress  an opportunity to speak directly to the members opposing the aid  was rebuffed. Yet he still spoke to some House members Thursday.\nZelenskyy asked for a joint session, we just didnt have time. Hes already given a joint session, McCarthy told reporters.\nRep. Steny Hoyer, D-Maryland, was among the House members who met with Zelenskyy.\nHoyer said in a statement that “we must do whatever it takes to ensure that Ukraine prevails over Russia in this fight for the future of democracy.”\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER \n“Vladimir Putin, Kim Jong Un, Xi Jinping, and the dictators of the world are watching what we do next,” the congressman said in a statement. “Our Congress, country, and coalition of freedom-loving peoples around the world need to stand united in defense of our sacred democratic values. That means giving the Ukrainians whatever military materiel, humanitarian aid, and political support necessary to defeat Russia.”\nSenate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, said he was glad to have about the opportunity to ask questions about the state of Ukraine’s counteroffensive and hear from the Ukrainian president firsthand. He supports aid to Ukraine.\n“At the risk of repeating myself, American support for Ukraine is not charity. It’s an investment in our own direct interests – not least because degrading Russia’s military power helps to deter our primary strategic adversary, China,” McConnell said in a statement.\nRussia annexed Crimea in 2014 and initiated attacks on Ukraine’s Donbas region the same year. Russian forces mounted a larger invasion of Ukraine last year but they failed to meet key military objectives. The protracted conflict has killed nearly 10,000 Ukrainian civilians and injured an additional 17,500, according to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights.\nMilitary casualties are staggering: an estimated 300,000 Russian soldiers, including 120,000 dead, and nearly 200,000 Ukrainian soldiers, including about 70,000 killed, according to U.S. officials interviewed by The New York Times last month.\nAs he arrived in Washington, Zelenskyy mentioned the latest overnight mass missile attacks from Russia that struck Ukrainian energy facilities.\n“We must work together to fully deprive Russia of its terrorist potential,” Zelenskyy said via X."

    "title": "Maryland lawmakers push to designate the Chesapeake Bay as a national recreation area",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  The Chesapeake Bay could see a boost in status under legislation introduced this summer to designate the region as a National Recreation Area.\nSponsored by Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Maryland, and Rep. John Sarbanes, D-Maryland, the Chesapeake National Recreation Area Act would allow the National Park Service to bring into its network sites in the Chesapeake Bay watershed, which covers over 60,000 square miles across six states and Washington, D.C. Sites would be included either through donations or purchases, but the new designation would not affect the rights of other property owners along the watershed.\n“We know that the Chesapeake Bay is a national treasure and its a global treasure,” Van Hollen said in an interview with Capital News Service. “We believe that by including this national treasure within the National Park Service system, we will ensure that it is protected in the future.”\nEfforts to establish a Chesapeake National Recreation Area date back to the 2000s, when a study called for the bay to become a unit of the National Park Service. This year’s legislation also comes amid attempts to mitigate the declining health of the Chesapeake Bay watershed and efforts to highlight lesser-known parts of bay history, including the contributions of Native Americans and Black watermen to the ecosystem and economy.\nThe bill was created through a “unique process,” Van Hollen said. In 2021, in a practice uncommon among most lawmakers, he and Sarbanes created a working group to solicit feedback on what the legislation should look like.\nThe bill is currently in committee but Van Hollen said a bipartisan coalition of lawmakers is “determined to get it over the finish line” by the end of this congressional session.\nCurrently, the park service administers certain sites in the watershed, including those designated as national monument units. The Chesapeake Gateways program, established through federal legislation in 1998, allows the park service to partner with and provide assistance to local and regional organizations involved in the bay.\nBut lawmakers are calling for the park service to play a larger and more administrative role, especially as they strive to tell previously-untold stories about the watershed’s inhabitants.\n“Right now, theres no entity whose mission is to help tell the stories of the Chesapeake Bay,” Van Hollen said. “If you look at the Chesapeake Bay, in many ways, its history is a microcosm of our American history… so there are all sorts of stories.”\nFor Maryland residents like Vincent Leggett, whose families have been involved in those stories for generations as avid fishermen, shipbuilders and dockworkers, the bill offers the promise of highlighting history that’s previously been passed over.\nLeggett is a member of Blacks of the Chesapeake — an organization that aims to highlight Black history in the watershed — which was part of the working group for the bill.\n“African Americans, I feel, were the backbone to the maritime and seafood industries here in the Chesapeake Bay region, but our stories were not elevated, nor were they exposed through our own voices,” Leggett said.\nLeggett hopes that expanding the reach of the park service in the region will also draw these populations into bay conservation. Only 7% of the state’s bay shoreline is publicly accessible, he said, causing a “sense of alienation” for people of color in the region who can’t get involved in cleanup efforts.\nAccording to the Chesapeake Bay Program, the main entity responsible for conservation and restoration of the bay, there are 1,296 public access points to the body of water across its six watershed states and Washington, D.C.\nThe bill, if passed, would authorize the park service to administer additional landmarks in the Chesapeake Bay watershed — a step Van Hollen said would further improve public access to the bay.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER \nBlacks of the Chesapeake has worked with state and federal lawmakers in Maryland on several projects along the bay, Leggett said, including planning a heritage park at the historically-Black Elktonia Beach in Annapolis and ensuring that Black history is highlighted at Whitehall Manor, which was built by enslaved individuals. Some of these sites, if acquired by the park service, could become highlights of a Chesapeake National Recreation Area.\nThe bill’s sponsors also touted the legislation as an opportunity to create jobs and enhance Maryland’s economy.\n“By designating a unified National Recreation Area for the Chesapeake Bay, this legislation seeks to elevate the regional stories that shaped our nation’s history, promote the spirit of stewardship, improve public access and spur economic growth across the bay region,” Sarbanes said in an e-mail to CNS.\nThe lawmakers have projected that turning the watershed into a park service unit will boost tourism in the region, augmenting its already-major role in the bay states’ economies. In Maryland, recreational boating generates an average of $2.03 billion and 32,025 jobs each year, and wildlife-watching excursions generate over $600 million a year, according to the Chesapeake Bay Foundation.\nLeggett said that the bill is an opportunity to foster these industries while increasing awareness of the bay’s integral role in the region.\n“I think that by bringing more attention to the Chesapeake Bay… it just generates so many millions of dollars and employment opportunities and tourism,” he said. “I think that as we endeavor to improve the water quality of the bay, that is going to enhance the fisheries, it is going to enhance heritage tourism and all of the related businesses that surround it.”"

    "title": "Vivek Ramaswamy’s debut on Republican debate stage leads to increased online popularity",
    "content": "Political newcomer Vivek Ramaswamy’s following on his X account (formerly known as Twitter) jumped 18% the week after the first Republican presidential debate on Aug. 23, according to data from Social Blade, a site that tracks user statistics among various platforms. \nRamaswamy, a 38-year-old businessman who founded a biotech and healthcare company, gained the highest percentage of new followers among the GOP candidates in the seven days following the debate. His highest daily total was Aug. 24 when he gained nearly 115,000 new followers.\n\nTrump participated in an interview with former Fox News host Tucker Carlson on the X platform instead of attending the debate. He accumulated almost 750,000 new followers in the week after the debate, the most by any of the potential candidates in terms of raw numbers but representing less than 1% total growth for Trump, who has over 87 million followers as of mid-September.\nTrump’s former vice president, Mike Pence, lost 970 followers the week after the debate, according to Social Blade. Pence struck a subdued tone during the debate. He was pressed on issues of the Trump-Pence administration and faced scrutiny from some members in his party for not overturning the 2020 election.\nStill, the former vice president has 5.7 million followers as of Sept. 21, significantly more than Ramaswamy’s 1.3 million followers.\n\nRamaswamy fielded jabs from each of the Republican candidates but drew particular attention from Pence. Stefan Mychajliw, Ramaswamy’s deputy communications director, said this is exactly what the campaign wanted to happen.\n“The fact that the (former) vice president and every politician on that stage attacked Vivek, I thought was great,” said Mychajliw. “That showed us that we were out in front, the message was right. And look, if people like the vice president and other politicians did not attack Vivek, I’d say there’s a serious problem.”\nRamaswamy was very active on X in the days after the debate. He posted 83 times on Aug. 24, many of which were reposts of coverage and videos that praised his performance.\nFormer United Nations Ambassador and South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley and North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum were the only other candidates whose followings on X increased more than one percentage point in the seven-day period following the debates. Burgum had the fewest followers out of the group with just over 25,000 as of debate night. \nTrump’s following on the X platform is more than 15 times larger than the rest of the candidates. \n\n\nThe former president, who has been indicted four times and said he is not attending any future debates, posted only once on X since regaining access to his account in November 2022. It was a photo of his mugshot from the Fulton County, Georgia, sheriffs office linking to his campaign site.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER \nTotal followers were not the only way Ramaswamy experienced a popularity boost. He increased in search popularity, compared to Pence and the other candidates, according to Google Analytics data.\nMychajliw was in the war room during the debate searching via Google how many people looked up Ramaswamy’s name, in addition to the other candidates. He said it was a “mountain compared to a tiny molehill.”\n\nThe next Republican debate will be held at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Institute in Simi Valley, California, on Sept. 27. Hutchinson and Burgum did not qualify for the second debate.\n\nUpdate: North Dakoda Gov, Doug Burgum was a late addition to the Second Republican Debate and was on the stage on Sept. 27, according to multiple reports. At the time of publication, Burgam was not qualifying. Hutchinson still did not qualify."

    "title": "Saturday is National Dance Day, with a focus on hip-hop&#8217;s 50th anniversary",
    "content": "[vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text]\nWASHINGTON  Saturday marks the 14th annual National Dance Day, which this year coincides with the 50th anniversary of hip-hop as a genre, making that musical and dance form the focus of activities in the nation’s capital.\n“I am pleased to join the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts and the American Dance Movement again this year to enjoy and celebrate our nations rich artistic, regional, ethnic, and racial diversity in honor of National Dance Day,” Rep. Eleanor Holmes Norton, D-District of Columbia, said in a statement. “I look forward to being dazzled once again by this year’s talented dance troupes.”\nNational Dance Day was created in 2010 when Norton, who has a passion for dance, partnered with “So You Think You Can Dance co-creator Nigel Lythgoe to initiate the first celebrations in Washington and California. Norton has introduced a congressional resolution honoring the day every year.\nThe Kennedy Center’s events on Saturday begin at 10:30 a.m., featuring Washington area movement artists Lauren DeVera, Project ChArma and Chitra Subramanian, as well as dance classes and performances. The center also is headlining DJ sets from True School DJs, including DJ Face, DJ Marc Nfinit and DJ Spinderella.\nAdditionally, hip-hop nonprofit Words Beats  Life is hosting its annual “Freshest of All Time” competition and its “Fine Line Paint Jam.”\nMazi Mutafa, the executive director of Words Beats  Life, said National Dance Day gives people an opportunity to both learn about dance and to experiment with dancing in a social environment.\nMutafa said National Dance Day focusing on hip-hop styles of dance is also significant because 2024 will be the first year where breaking, a particular style of hip-hop, is now a competitive sport in the Olympics.\n“So this idea that something that started out on the street corners in New York City, on linoleum or cardboard boxes is now an Olympic event is really significant,” he said. “It says a lot about the decades of work put in by dancers to host events like this.”\nWords Beats  Life’s “Freshest of All Time” competition is one of the city’s largest breakdancing competitions, featuring crews from the Washington region, Philadelphia, Boston and New York. Winners will collect a $1,000 prize.\nThe nonprofit’s “Fine Lines Paint Jam” will highlight 11 artists from all over the country who are coming to the Kennedy Center to create live mural paintings.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER \nMutafa said these paintings, which will be on movable wooden boards, will be donated to Washington’s Anacostia High School on Tuesday so they can be presented to the community at large.\nWords Beats  Life partners with that high school for programming such as free, after-school arts classes for breaking, fine art, street art and graffiti.\n“We invite former and current students to come out and showcase some of their murals,” Mutafa said. “Two of the murals that are going to be featured are (from) former students of ours.”\nAmerican Dance Movement also aims to make National Dance Day as accessible as possible by providing an instructional dance routine people can learn at home, choreographed by “World of Dance” finalist Poppin John.\n“American Dance Movement believes that participation in dance connects the mind and body, promotes health and wellbeing, connects us with others and enables us to find joy through dance and movement,” according to the organization’s website.\n[/vc_column_text][/vc_column][/vc_row]\nCorrection: An earlier version of this article misnamed the group Words Beats  Life in some references."

    "title": "In Maryland, Biden touts economic successes, blasts GOP policies as &#8216;extreme&#8217;",
    "content": "LARGO, Md.  President Joe Biden on Thursday touted his economic policies and contrasted the results with what he called the Republicans’ “extreme” budget proposals to give more tax breaks to the wealthy and cut social programs.\nBidenomics, the president told a crowd at Prince George’s Community College here, “is investing in America, the American people, growing the economy from the middle out from the bottom up instead of the top down.” \nHe noted that “Bidenomics” is a term some economists and conservative media used to dismiss the administration’s economic vision. “But now they’re getting it,” the president said. \nBiden said his policies had created 13 million jobs, including 800,000 in manufacturing, and kept unemployment under 4% for 19 months, including record lows in unemployment among Black and Hispanic workers, veterans, and the lowest jobless rate in 70 years among women. \nBy contrast, Biden labeled GOP economic proposals “MAGAnomics,” insisting they would balloon the deficit due with tax cuts for the wealthy. And Republicans want to cut Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, the Affordable Care Act and the Child Tax Credit, among other social programs, the president charged. \n“Their plan, MAGAnomics, is more extreme than anything America’s ever seen before,” Biden said.\nBiden also stated that job satisfaction was higher than it has been in 36 years and that his administration is growing the economy. “Thats Bidenomics, thats the objective of it,” he said. \nBidens economic message is the centerpiece of his bid for reelection, but the president is battling against widespread public dissatisfaction with the economy. Almost 70% of Americans feel the economy is getting worse, according to a Suffolk University Sawyer Business School/USA Today poll released Wednesday. The survey said 84% of respondents said their cost of living is going up.\nSade Davis, a second-year public health student at Prince Georges Community College, does not see it that way. As a mother to two sons and a first-generation college student, she told Capital News Service in an interview that Biden is a symbol of hope for families like hers, representing a dedication to bolster the middle class and support hardworking American families. \nDavis, who introduced Biden, said she believes in the direction the president is leading the country, emphasizing, I think we definitely need some kind of economic push in the right direction.\nWhen asked how Biden can reverse polls showing most Americans are unhappy with the economy, she emphasized the need for Americans to pursue education and opportunities like she has.\n“When we have more educated Americans that actually understand President Bidens agenda, its easier to share that message with your neighbor,” she said. \nRep. Steny Hoyer, D-Maryland, said in remarks before Biden spoke that factories are opening across America.” Hoyer also touted the Biden administrations efforts to lower health care, prescription drug, and energy costs.  \nBiden dismissed his predecessor as “Donald Hoover Trump” and blistered Republicans for saying that “everything’s wrong with America.”\n“They keep telling us that America is failing,” the president said. “Well, they’re wrong. They’re failing. America’s not failing. America’s winning, and there’s one reason for it: you.”"

    "title": "Congress, health officials look to improve federal response to the next crisis",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  Congress has begun deliberations on how to improve federal law governing the response to public health crises like the COVID pandemic that killed more than 1 million people in the United States alone.\n“To be honest, as Americans, we can understand that every public official tried their best during this COVID (crisis),” Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vermont, chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, said at a public hearing earlier this month. “But the truth is that we were very, very unprepared for what hit us three years ago. It took a lot longer for us to respond to that emergency than it should have.”\nA 2006 law intended to provide necessary resources for such a crisis expires Sept. 30 and needs to be reauthorized. Lawmakers have asked public health officials, doctors, hospitals and scientists for suggested changes that would improve the response to a future pandemic.\nSen. Bill Cassidy, R-Louisiana, said the current law’s framework proved to be far from perfect during the COVID pandemic.\n“The government clearly failed consistently and clearly failed to communicate with the public,” Cassidy said. “Let’s update the playbook and make sure whatever we do it’s flexible enough to address the threats beyond just a pandemic.”\nThe American Society for Microbiology said in a statement that the reauthorization is an important opportunity to “improve our nation’s ability to respond in a timely and coordinated manner” to future public health threats. The ASM wrote that labs in particular would play a significant role in the early stages of pandemics for testing and studying diseases.\nBefore the pandemic, the CDC had 187 health facilities and now has 25,000 facilities to manage statistics and data. The agency is asking for clear data from states regarding vital statistics and death registries that are currently only provided voluntarily, according to Dr. Rochelle Walensky, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n“If we are supposed to stop disease outbreaks before they start, before they become emergencies, we have to have line of sight as to when those urgent issues are sparked,” Walensky said.\nWalensky said it took six months to get hospitalization data during the pandemic. She said that making the data more accessible would allow Americans and policymakers to make more informed decisions with the resources available.\nDr. Reshma Ramachandran, an assistant professor of medicine at Yale University, said the reauthorization needs to negotiate a ceiling price for vaccines to protect patients from anticipated price hikes by major companies.\n“While Moderna executives became billionaires, taxpayers were price gouged,” said Public Citizen President Robert Weissman. “Hundreds of thousands or maybe millions of people lost their lives because we had a global shortage of a vaccine that could have been avoided.”\nWeissman said that to prevent these companies from making decisions for profit, starting prices must be determined by the United States not paying more than other high income countries. He said that life-saving vaccines deserve to be shared with everyone to save their lives.\nRamachandran said it is frightening that patients could still not be able to afford a publicly-funded vaccine once the pandemic period ends.\n“No one should be poor because they’re sick and no one should be sick because they’re poor,” she said.\nModerna CEO Stephane Bancel told the Senate committee in March that his company would make sure cost would not prevent anyone from getting the vaccine.\nDuring the pandemic, there was a heavy reliance on imported PPE, Sen. Bob Casey Jr., D-Pennsylvania, said at the hearing.\nDawn O’Connell, assistant secretary for preparedness and response at the Department of Health and Human Services, said there has been $16 billion dedicated to creating PPE in the country, but the ability to continue to do so must be maintained through the reauthorization.\nAs part of the reauthorization, Walensky said the CDC would also ask for new funding, including danger pay for healthcare professionals, tax-exempt loan repayment options for their education and overtime pay increases. These incentives are intended to hire professionals for the 80,000 unfilled public health jobs, according to Walensky."

    "title": "Cardin reintroduces bipartisan bill to authorize coastal watershed habitat conservation program",
    "content": "WASHINGTON – Marking American Wetlands Month, Sens. Ben Cardin, D-Maryland, and Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, have reintroduced legislation aimed at continuing conservation programs at two dozen coastal areas, including the Chesapeake Bay.\nThe Coastal Habitat Conservation Act is being sponsored in the House by Reps. Jared Huffman, D-California, and Jennifer González-Colón, R-Puerto Rico.\nThe Senate and House bills would give statutory authority to, as well as fund, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Coastal Program, which is voluntary and partnership-based.\nThe program focuses on 24 priority coastal areas along the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, the Gulf of Mexico, the Great Lakes, and in the Caribbean. First established in the Chesapeake Bay in 1985, would receive between $20 million and $25 million from fiscal 2024 through fiscal 2028.\n“Climate change, development and other pressures are challenging our coastal communities, increasing the need to strengthen successful efforts like the Coastal Program that serve to protect and engage them,” Cardin said in a statement. “Our legislation demonstrates Congress’ bipartisan commitment to strategic habitat conservation in coastal watersheds, which provide a host of ecosystem services such as recreation, tourism, fisheries and education.”\nThe Coastal Program works on habitat conservation on both public and private lands. Because coastal watersheds are often comprised of both private and public land, the program is able to provide “landscape conservation, maintain habitat connectivity and continuity, and to connect and engage partners with the (Fish and Wildlife) Service’s conservation priorities and objectives,” according to the program’s website.\nWhile the Coastal Program does not have a position on the latest legislation, Stephen Guertin, deputy director for program management and policy for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, previously testified in support of the Coastal Habitat Conservation Act of 2021 at a committee hearing.\n“These (the Coastal Program’s) projects provide lasting benefits to coastal communities by employing contractors and stimulating local economies, restoring coastal wetlands that support commercial and recreational fisheries, improving water quality, and increasing opportunities for hunting, fishing, and wildlife observation,” Guertin said during his testimony in 2022.\n“The Coastal Program is one of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s most effective and proven initiatives, bringing together public and private partners to voluntarily protect and improve coastal habitats,” González-Colón said.\nThe program is also unique in its ability to provide both financial and technical assistance to third-party land acquisitions in order to protect habitats.\n“The Fish and Wildlife Service Coastal Program has been around for several decades but has gone unauthorized, which means that each and every year Congress has to come back and determine an appropriate funding level and appropriate funding for it,” said Allison Colden, Maryland executive director of the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, established in 1966 to focus on improving water quality and habitat of the Bay.\nThe Chesapeake Bay Foundation and the Coastal Program have worked together on some projects, including on a dairy farm in Gambrills, Maryland, which was formerly owned by the United States Naval Academy. During this project, the two programs worked on improving the water quality through tree planting and on wetland restoration, according to Colden.\nPrograms that are authorized and have funding set out in advance are better able to plan for the future, Colden said. For programs whose authorization has expired, like the Coastal Program, this can be more challenging.\nThrough this latest legislation, the program would receive more funding from the government than it has in previous years.\n“The other thing is to think about how well this program leverages outside funding and the fact that theyre able to achieve such great projects and such great work throughout the entire country, with just that little amount of funding,” Colden said. “Its an extremely cost-effective program that helps bring in dollars and consolidate dollars from other areas to support the federal investment.”\n“With increasing pressures from climate change, sea level rise, land development, pollution, and habitat fragmentation, this program is more important than ever,” Kathy Tsantiris, associate director of government relations at Ocean Conservancy, said in a statement. “Congress should act swiftly to pass this bipartisan and bicameral legislation, which will authorize the Coastal Program in perpetuity with regular appropriations.”"

    "title": "Outdoors could be key to improving post-pandemic learning",
    "content": "WASHINGTON – When Tom Ackerman first began his teaching career in Harford County, the end of the school day always brought about frustration.\nDuring the final minutes of the class, he would attempt to wrangle his most challenging students’ attention and connect them with his lessons.\nBut one day, Ackerman’s principal – a former gym teacher – gave the science teacher a piece of advice that changed everything: take the students outside.\nAckerman started teaching his most difficult class outside on Friday afternoons. Each week, students would return to the classroom and excitedly share what they discovered. Before long, all of his classes wanted the same experience. \n“They were just into it,” said Ackerman, who is now the Chesapeake Bay Foundations vice president for education. \nThat moment was one of many that spurred Ackerman to join a nationwide coalition to improve access to outdoor education opportunities for K-12 students. \nFor more than a decade, educators, environmentalists and dozens of policymakers have struggled to spur congressional action on Maryland Democratic Rep. John Sarbanes’s No Child Left Inside Act, which would allocate federal funding to environmental education initiatives.\nLast month, the bill’s sponsors reintroduced the No Child Left Inside Act in Congress more than a decade after it was first proposed. The coalition’s reiterated push for action on the measure comes as climate change education and pandemic learning loss conversations have become increasingly present in American politics.\nIf passed, the No Child Left Inside Act would provide states with federal grants to develop partnerships between schools and organizations to foster real-world environmental and scientific experiences. \nOutdoor education programs have been proven to have a positive effect on the educational, physical and emotional development of young people, according to the U.S. Department of Education. \nOne 2018 study published in Frontiers in Psychology compared outcomes from identical lessons taught inside and outside and concluded that teachers were able to teach for almost twice as long without having to interrupt instruction to redirect students after outdoor lessons.\nThe No Child Left Inside Act has been reintroduced multiple times in Congress since first stalling in 2007. Even in years where the bill has passed out of the House, it has consistently faced challenges in the opposite chamber. \nDespite the initiative’s bumpy history, Sarbanes said its timely passage is crucial to help future generations prepare for and combat the looming effects of climate change. \n“Our young people are going to be the stewards of the planet and theyre the leading edge of what we do to preserve our planet and combat climate change,” Sarbanes told Capital News Service. “I cant think of a better way of getting them ready for that responsibility than making sure that they have strong environmental education opportunities.”\nAdvocates also believe the bill’s subject matter revolves around a top priority for parents, students and educators across the country as they emerge from distance learning and attempt to make up for massive pandemic learning loss.\nThe 2022 National Assessment of Educational Progress showed an average four-point drop in learning nationally compared with 2019 – equating to roughly two decades of educational progress.\n“You would think that learning outdoors would have been the solution to living through a pandemic, but there were all kinds of reasons why that didnt work,” said Jackie Ostfeld who directs the Sierra Club’s Outdoors For All campaign. “Theres no quicker way to make up for learning loss and to grow test scores and to get your kids outdoors.”\nThe pandemic “shined a light” on how important engaged, in-person learning experiences are for students, Ostfeld said. Mitigating the pandemic’s impact on American education has also coincided with the bill having its strongest coalition ever this year, Ostfeld added.\nThe coalition has made progress in recent years by aligning the bill’s goals with other federal education initiatives. The 2015 Every Students Succeed Act included a provision from the No Child Left Inside Act that helped states integrate environmental learning into their regular curriculum.\nBut the No Child Left Inside Act is still a “long game” initiative, Ostfeld said. \nDespite its slow progress, the bill’s consistent presence in Congress has already prompted dozens of states to develop environmental literacy plans in anticipation of its passage. Maryland was the first state in the nation to implement this plan, as the state requires an environmental literacy graduation requirement for all high schoolers.\nBills that are proactive and work to guide slow but steady progress take longer to pass than those brought on by a glaring national issue, Ostfeld said. Even if 2023 is not the year for federal action, millions of students in states that have started to incorporate outdoor education curriculum will continue to benefit from advocacy related to it. \n“Were not reacting to some horrible thing in the world. We are being proactive and saying, ‘This is what the future needs to look like,’” Ostfeld said. “This bill helped to spark a movement, but now the movement is out there and the movement is strong. Every time the movement gets stronger and stronger and stronger, decision makers in Washington will hear about it.”"

    "title": "Independent reporters on social media report DC crime to large audiences",
    "content": "During regular business hours, independent reporter Larry Calhoun works as a manager. Alan Henney is a full-time caregiver. Others like them balance being college students. \nHours for prime reporting, however, continue late into the night for these Twitter users covering crime, traffic, and other breaking news in and around Washington, D.C.\nDespite Twitter’s shifting functions and guidelines under the ownership of Elon Musk, about half of Twitter users regularly get news from the site, according to a 2022 survey by the Pew Research Center. Meanwhile, the number of  broadcast and print news consumers has declined. A 2022 YouGov survey of over 93,000 online news consumers in 46 markets revealed that the gap between news viewership on websites and apps versus social media is continuing to widen.\nThis shift in news consumption created an opportunity for independent reporters like Calhoun, who has run @RealTimeNews10 on Twitter since May 2020. \nDemand and a collective passion for public safety has led to the emergence of Calhoun and those like him. Calhoun was inspired to begin his news coverage after speaking with community members, and after a July 2020 incident where he said he was struck by a stray bullet in Prince George’s County.\n“Im someone who has that ability to talk about these issues  Ive been victimized by someone who wanted to shoot indiscriminately in my community, Calhoun said. And Ive been hurt and injured. And so I dont want to see anybody else deal with that.  You just wouldnt believe how many people were just really concerned about so many things that they see and hear thats going on around them but not seeing it make it to the news.”\nIn the D.C. Metro Area, Calhoun is part of a like-minded online community seeking to inform their physical communities. Larger accounts like @RealTimeNews10, @killmoenetwork and @alanhenney, have tens of thousands of followers. Many, like Calhoun, attribute their growth on social media to their ability to share information quickly.\nMany accounts primarily report crime alerts, from carjackings to domestic abuse situations. Other accounts like @CordellTraffic report on traffic incidents, fires and even construction on roadways. The ability to report on multiple beats, they say, is a strength of working for themselves.\nAlan Henney studied and started a career in journalism at George Washington University and Channel 9 News in Washington. He began independently reporting news on Twitter in 2011.\n“One reason people end up following us because we’re getting it out, Henney said. Short circuiting, jumping through the hoops quicker than the traditional news operations which follow the traditional journalism standards. Going back and asking for their comment.\nSeveral reporters credit Henney for their start in independent journalism. Whereas traditional news organizations are often competitors, independent reporters say they’re collaborators. Vilis Kuskevics started covering Montgomery and Prince George’s counties on Twitter as @MoCoPGNews. He began his account as a hobby in the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic after being sent home from the College of Charleston in South Carolina.\nKuskevics said area independent reporters amplify each other’s work, and communicate alerts through a walkie talkie app throughout the day. \n“I build relationships with them,” Kuskevics said. “And its like, you have to as independent journalists, because theres only a handful of us. So if we cant work together, then you know, whats the point?” \nKuskevics’ coverage area includes several colleges, and as a student himself he says he is able to see incidents from students’ perspective. Kuskevics is passionate about highlighting the importance of mental health on his feed, and was able to do so last month after an off-campus incident near the University of Maryland.\n“I did learn recently that by posting the number to the 988 lifeline, someone called in after I tweeted what happened, and just was able to talk for a little bit,” he said. “And she kind of told me like ‘hey, that saved my life. You putting that info out there to reach the 988 lifeline.”\nThe independent reporters of DMV Twitter. (Graphic: Eva Booth | Capital News Service)\nReporters like Kuskevics utilize a long list of tools in their reporting process. These resources include apps for metrorail incidents, helicopter activity and crime alerts. The reporters also use communication and text messaging apps like Zello and GroupMe to push alerts to each other. The apps allow reporters to quickly communicate about each other’s beats.\n“Alan may throw something at me just to let me know whats going on. And then I can go jump on his scanner and catch up with it and monitor it and I can drop a report,” Calhoun said. “Thats the good thing about social media. I dont need to be in-office. I dont need to be at a computer. I can drop a report straight from my phone.”\nIndependent reporters pride themselves on their efficiency, ability to quickly report on-scene, and their coverage of issues they say are underreported by mainstream media. Additionally, many take pride in being free from funding and able to voice their personal opinions.\n“We dont follow the traditional journalism guidelines,” Henney said. “Before you gotta wait for the police, wait for the press release, wait for the spokesperson to tell you whats happened. And thats one reason why weve become so popular is that we kind of cut through the bureaucratic tape and get try to get to the story as quickly as possible.”\nThat’s opened reporters to praise and criticism from the users who follow and engage with them on Twitter.  Their credibility and what they cover is sometimes challenged, including by politicians and members of the mainstream media. Police departments and other public safety personnel are sometimes reluctant to provide on-scene information.\n“The media will get incorrect information even from the police spokespeople. So its not just us making the mistakes, Calhoun said. We all make assumptions as humans, and were doing it at a much faster pace. Were trying to get out much quicker and well make mistakes.\nOne follower, Lionel Dripps, is a homeowner in Petworth who grew up in Virginia and has lived in Washington for the last 10 years. Dripps noted that research has shown that neighborhood social media apps like Nextdoor can lead people to overestimate how much crime is happening in their neighborhoods.\n“Specifically focusing on independent crime reporters, I feel really mixed. I do want to know what is happening in my neighborhood. But consuming news of every crime alert in the D.C. area can give you a mistaken understanding of how much crime is happening,” Dripps said. “Reading some of the crime reporters can make it feel like D.C. is a war zone, but even though violent crime has increased, D.C. is still seeing dramatically less crime than in the ‘90s.”\nSupporters praise crime news accounts for operating like a database and helping citizens stay alert about certain areas.\n“They report quicker than official news,” said Ally Vyne, an independent documentary filmmaker in Maryland. “Seems like they have bigger boots on the ground touching base with D.C. residents immediately after an event occurs. They also report on politics as it relates to crime. They help give us a voice.”  \nRegardless of feedback, Calhoun and others say their passion for informing the public fuels them.\n“I kind of put myself in that category of a citizen journalist, but at the same time, I think Ive earned the moniker as an independent journalist,” Calhoun said. “Just putting in the time and being consistent and accurate, going to scenes and actually documenting. \nSo, I feel like Im doing the same things that regular reporters or journalists that are doing — my lane is just more public safety.”"

    "title": "Hogan&#8217;s environment agency was underfunded and underperformed, experts say",
    "content": "WASHINGTON — Funding cuts and staffing shortages at the Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) over the past decade have coincided with a decline in the state’s ecological health.\nMDE’s water-related enforcement actions and identification of major polluters plummeted during former Gov. Larry Hogan’s time in office.  During this same period, water quality standards in the Chesapeake Bay declined significantly, falling to the same levels as those observed in the early 1990s, according to data from Chesapeake Progress. \nOver two decades, MDE lost one out of every seven employees and those positions went unfilled as environmental challenges increased.\n“What we saw in 2021 and in prior years was just a really dramatic cut-off (in resources) and Hogan’s initiatives to make sure that state agencies weren’t fully enforcing the law,” Katlynn Schmitt, a senior analyst at the Center for Progressive Reform, told Capital News Service. She is one of the authors of the 2022 Chesapeake Accountability Project scorecard  an evaluation of “water-related enforcement trends over the last two decades,” according to its website.\nBen Grumbles, Secretary of the Environment under Hogan from 2015 until March 2022, disputed allegations of lax water quality enforcement.\n“The administration absolutely put an emphasis on compliance and enforcement,” he said. “We imposed and recovered many record setting penalties. We also had to deal with COVID  we were not able to have on-site inspections because they put our employees at risk.”\n\n“When you get much below 1% (funding), thats when you start to see a lot of pollution problems…It kind of sends a signal to polluters that youre not going to get caught,” said Doug Myers, Maryland senior scientist for the Chesapeake Bay Foundation.\nMore than 18 million people live within the Chesapeake watershed and over 3,600 species of plants and animals call the bay home. The bay is an integral part of the regional economy, providing upwards of 500 million pounds of seafood each year. However,  commercial fishery stocks in the region have plummeted in recent years.\nThe Chesapeake Bay is America’s largest estuary, and its watershed encompasses six states and the District of Columbia. Among these, Maryland provided its environmental protection agency with one of the lowest funding levels in 2020. Only West Virginia allocated a smaller percentage of its general fund to its environmental department. \nThis low funding has observable results. The 2022 CAP scorecard said that “there has been a dramatic decline in the number of enforcement actions taken by the Water  Science Administration (WSA) (a subsidiary of MDE), the number of sites inspected, and the number of significant violations identified involving environmental or health impacts.”\nAlthough the scorecard says that the MDE situation has been degrading since the early 2000s, many of the identified changes became more severe during Hogan’s tenure, beginning in 2015.\nFrom 2010 to 2015, the WSA took 1,280 enforcement actions against water policy violators; from 2016 to 2021, that number plummeted to less than a third of that to 422. The number of total site inspections by the WSA also fell from almost 29,000 to less than 18,000 in those same time periods.\n“So if your political philosophy is to shrink the size of government, and do as little as possible with it, that works great in your favor,” Myers told CNS. “But then when you get to the point where youre no longer producing the services the government is supposed to provide  for example, protecting water quality  then its really hard to get that funding back.”\nThe decline in regulatory capacity at MDE coincided with new challenges for the Chesapeake Bay. \nIn 2022, the Chesapeake Bay Foundation gave the bay’s health a D+ rating. The current score of 32/100 is only a marginal improvement over 1998’s inaugural score of 27/100. \nChesapeake Progress found that only 27% of the Chesapeake Bay by surface area had acceptable levels of dissolved oxygen, chlorophyll alpha and water clarity in 2020. This represents a precipitous drop from the monitoring program’s highs in the mid-2010s.\n\nPhosphorus and nitrogen fuel the growth of algae species that thrive at the expense of other marine life.  The Choptank River in Eastern Maryland in particular was determined to have “degrading” phosphorus and nitrogen load trends, according to Chesapeake Progress, as was the Susquehanna River’s overall long-term sediment trend.\nQian Zhang, an assistant research scientist at the Chesapeake Bay Program who worked on the Chesapeake Progress report, said that the primary source of these nutrient loads are “generally” agricultural facilities and farms. \nA May report from Scientific American highlighted the Eastern Shore, home to the Choptank, as a region with many soy and corn farms, as well as chicken farms. According to river conservationist Elle Bassett, these farms can contribute extreme loads of problematic nutrients to water sources during heavy rains  and many are mere miles from the bay itself.\n“A lot of pollution slips through the cracks, even with adequate enforcement of the laws,” Schmitt said. “There are far more polluters than there are regulators. So right now, for instance, in Maryland, every waterway inspector is given approximately 600 facilities that they are accountable for.” \nIn 2022, there were 53 MDE inspectors tasked with managing 31,000 permits, according to Schmitt.\nThere are other emerging challenges beyond nutrient loads that the MDE needs to tackle, according to experts.\nPeter Tango, Chesapeake Bay monitoring coordinator for CBP, said that new working groups are being created to keep tabs on new hydrological threats. \n“We recognize that there are new pollutants that are out in the bay that we may not necessarily understand as well as we do with nutrient and sediment pollution,” he said, such as plastics and even toxic chemicals. \nCompounding all of this is the looming threat of climate change.\nWarmer waters hold less of the vital oxygen that marine life needs to survive. CBF’s Interim Maryland Executive Director Erik Fisher told CNS in February that increased water temperatures mean that the amount of nitrogen and phosphorus pollution that needs to be reduced to hit healthy oxygen targets is higher now. Warmer water combined with rising sea levels reducing available freshwater wetlands makes bay restoration a steeper climb. \nGov. Wes Moore’s 2024 budget includes over $5 million in funding for the MDE in support of “environmental conservation efforts,” as well as dozens of new positions. Moore’s administration has also increased the general fund allocation to the MDE by almost $30 million for 2024.\n“We face an historic challenge,” Moore said of his administration’s climate goals in April, “and we will tackle it with an all-of-government, an all-of-community, and an all-of-state approach.”"

    "content": "WASHINGTON – When Taìna Caragol, the National Portrait Gallery’s curator of painting, sculpture and Latino art and history, first walked through room after room of some 23,000 portraits, the lack of Latino representation was obvious to her.\n“The invisibility is structural. It’s not just the lack of portraits. The historical junctures that broaden those populations have not been explained,” Caragol told Capital News Service.\nOn Friday, the Smithsonian Institution’s National Portrait Gallery unveiled its first major exhibition dedicated to the year 1898.\nTitled “1898: U.S. Imperial Visions and Revisions,” the exhibit recognizes the 125th anniversary of three historical events: the War of 1898, the Philippine-American War (1899-1913) and the 1898 Congressional joint resolution to annex Hawaii.\nThe exhibition explores the pivotal period when the United States emerged as a world power, a time of global expansion that was celebrated by many Americans and vigorously opposed by others.\nHaving known each other for eight years, Caragol and Kate Clarke Lemay, the gallery’s acting senior historian, teamed up to combine Lemay’s knowledge of military history with Caragol’s academic training in Latino and Latin American art.\nCaragol, who is Puerto Rican, said that 1898 is a common topic of discussion on the island. But the year and its conflicts are seldom brought up on the United States mainland.\n“We’re historians, we’re just putting this information out there for people and we just hope that they think about it, and take something away from it,” Lemay said.\nAssembling exhibitions usually takes two or three years, Caragol said. The 1898 exhibition took six.\n“It was absolutely necessary, because it was such a complex history,” she said.\nVisitors walk through the exhibit and approach sections dedicated to each region, beginning with Cuba, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, then Guam and the Philippines.\nThe exhibit features descriptions in both English and Spanish. Physical PDFs and QR codes are placed around the exhibit to translate descriptions into three other languages: Chamoru, Filipino and ʻŌlelo Hawai‘i.\nThere are 94 artifacts and 54 portraits, 52% of which are non-Europeans.\nWASHINGTON  A portrait of the last reigning monarch of Hawaii, Queen Liliuokalani, painted by William Cogswell, has left the islands for the first time to be part of the Smithsonian Institutions National Portrait Gallery exhibition on 1898. (Micaela Hanson/Capital News Service)\nThe largest portrait features the last reigning monarch of Hawaii, Queen Liliuokalani, painted by William Cogswell.\nUntil now, the nearly 10-foot portrait had never left the islands. For more than 30 years, the portrait was hung on the walls of the ‘Iolani Palace.\nTo transport the portrait, a durable crate was built and shipped to Hawaii. Los Angeles art handlers shipped the royal portrait directly to Washington. A cross country journey was completed nonstop in special, climate-controlled conditions.\n“We were all just really, really excited for this loan to get to us,” Lemay said.\nCaragol and Lemay did not always go to such lengths to find artifacts.\n“I actually bought this on eBay,” Lemay said about a patriotic Spanish-American War fan featured in the “Consumer Culture” section of the exhibition. “Six years ago, Taina and I just started to look for stuff. Sometimes what you do is just keep an eye on what’s up in the market.”\nThe “Consumer Culture” section also includes American board games that promoted the war in 1898.\nIn “The Game of Naval War,” players moved their vessels around to acquire islands, raising their American flags as a ritual of ownership.\n“There is a legacy to the history that continues today,” Caragol said.\nAs of 2021, the United States has over 750 military bases in 80 countries across the world, the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft reported. The military bases still exist in the countries and territories explored in this exhibit: Cuba, Guam, the Philippines and Puerto Rico.\n“We want to bring about a broader consciousness that the United States is not just what lies inside the continent,” Caragol said. “It’s important to look at those lands that it has claimed overseas. The process has had an impact in the demographics of this country, in the domestic and foreign policy, and in the military policy.”\n“1898: U.S. Imperial Visions and Revisions” opened April 28 and runs until Feb. 25, 2024."

    "title": "Several Maryland Democrats expected to vie to replace Cardin",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  With long-serving Maryland Sen. Ben Cardin announcing his retirement Monday, Democrats are likely to see a primary fight next year to replace him.\nSo far, one Democrat  Montgomery County Councilmember Will Jawando  has announced his candidacy to replace Cardin, which most political observers consider a safe Democratic seat.\nOther potential Democratic candidates are Maryland Reps. Jamie Raskin and David Trone, Prince George’s County Executive Angela Alsobrooks and Baltimore County Executive Johnny Olszewski.\nA Republican who could have made the general election contest more competitive  former Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan  told “The Hill on NewsNation” Tuesday he would not run for the Senate, explaining “it’s just not something I ever aspired to do.”     \nCardin, 79, has served as senator since 2006. Before that, he represented Maryland’s 3rd Congressional District in the House and was the speaker of the Maryland House of Delegates.\n“I am proud of all I have done for Maryland,” Cardin said. “I have given my heart and soul to our great state, and I thank Marylanders for trusting me as your representative for all these years.” \nJawando, an attorney and author who served as an adviser to former Education Secretary Arne Duncan, announced his intention to run for Cardin’s seat in a video released Tuesday. \nJawando has focused on lowering rents, tackling racial justice issues and building affordable housing in Montgomery County. He said he’s running for Cardin’s seat because “I believe we can build a shared prosperity in Maryland that lifts everyone up.”\nJawando faces an uphill battle, especially if other high-profile candidates decide to enter the race.\n“Very slim chance,” John Dedie, a political science professor at the Community College of Baltimore County, told Capital News Service. “He is known in Montgomery County and nowhere else.”\nDedie was more bullish on Alsobrooks.\nDedie pointed to Alsobrooks’ experience at the local government level, saying that her work in PG County gives her insight into challenges such as infrastructure and transportation. And based on her overwhelming victory in the county executive race, Dedie thought Alsobrooks could make the jump to senator. \n“Theres nothing like being a county executive in a highly, densely-populated area to help yourself,” Dedie said of Alsobrooks. “She hasnt made political enemies that have caused any problems, so I think that she could become the natural favorite.”\nAlsobrooks also endorsed Gov. Wes Moore during his campaign, and he went on to win the county by almost 200,000 votes. Dedie thinks it’s possible the governor returns the favor. Moore’s endorsement would cement Alsobrooks as a contender — other challengers might not want to anger the current governor by running against a candidate he supports. \nDedie also noted that in 1992, the 10-person Maryland congressional delegation featured five women. The delegation is currently all men, a fact that could be a strong argument in favor of Alsobrooks.\nRaskin, who gained prominence when he led arguments in the impeachment trial against former President Donald Trump and recently announced his cancer is in remission, has not yet revealed his intentions. \nTrone also has not announced but has been hiring staff in anticipation of a campaign, as has Alsobrooks, according to Politico. \nHowever, Dedie pointed to Raskin’s health as something that might worry voters, and he noted that should Trone run for the Senate, it would be difficult for Democrats to maintain their seat in the 6th Congressional District, which includes several conservative counties.\nOn the Republican side, Dedie suggested that Kathy Szeliga, who ran against Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Maryland, in 2016 and received 36 percent of the vote, might be someone to watch.\nBut in a party dominated by Dan Cox, a staunch Trump supporter, it is unlikely that Maryland would select a moderate candidate to challenge for the open seat.\nAs such, Cardin and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-New York, maintained their confidence that Democrats would retain the seat. Marland hasn’t elected a Republican senator since Charles Mathias in 1980. \nKyle Kondik, editor of Sabato’s Crystal Ball at the University of Virginia’s Center for Politics, agreed.\n“In a presidential year and in a federal election, we still think Democrats would be clearly favored to hold the seat,” he wrote Tuesday.\nMaryland’s primary election will be May 14, 2024, and the general election is Nov. 5, 2024. \nOf the 100 Senate seats, 34 will be contested next year. The Democrats are defending 20 of those 34 seats; the Republicans hold 11 seats and independents three seats.\nThe Democrats currently maintain a thin 51-49-seat margin in the Senate (three independents caucus with the Democrats). \nBesides Cardin, two other Democratic senators so far have announced their retirements: Dianne Feinstein of California and Debbie Stabenow of Michigan. One Republican senator, Mike Braun of Indiana, has announced that he is running for governor."

    "title": "Debt ceiling fight leads Van Hollen, Democrats to revive proposal to eliminate the debt ceiling",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  Democratic Sens. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland and Brian Schatz of Hawaii have reintroduced a bill to get rid of the national debt limit set by Congress.\nThe Biden administration and congressional Democrats are in a face-off with GOP lawmakers over raising the debt limit. The United States government could hit the ceiling, meaning the Treasury Department would run out of funds and could no longer take on more debt, as early as June.\nFailure to reach an agreement to raise the debt ceiling could trigger a government shutdown, lower the U.S. credit rating and set off a wave of other negative economic impacts.\nThe senators’ bill proposes a more permanent solution to prevent a debt default: avoid it altogether.\n“A debt default by the United States would throw our economy into chaos and trigger massive job losses,” Van Hollen said in a statement. “It is time to defuse this economic time bomb that is repeatedly and recklessly used to threaten an economic doomsday in order to impose a radical political agenda. Let’s focus on real budget solutions to meet our national priorities in a fiscally responsible way.”\n“Republicans are using the debt limit to hold the country hostage,” said Schatz, the lead sponsor on the bill. “We need to stop playing this very dangerous game with the nation’s economy and get rid of the debt ceiling.”\nOn Feb. 15, the Congressional Budget Office projected that the money would run out between July and September, depending on April tax revenues. The Treasury Department is expected next week to provide an updated estimate of when it would exhaust its emergency measures to prevent the default.\nSen. Michael Bennet, D-Colorado, said the debt ceiling causes fights year after year. Eliminating the debt ceiling would permanently remove the threat of a debt default, Bennet said.\nThe current limit includes $31.4 trillion for federal spending like Social Security, interest on national debt and Medicare costs.\nRepublicans have argued that the debt limit and federal spending go hand-in-hand.\n“No clean debt ceiling is going to pass the House,” House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-California, said after the GOP majority in his chamber passed a debt limit measure that included spending cuts. President Joe Biden and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-New York, rejected the proposal.\nDemocrats point out that the debt is mostly made of mandatory expenses that already have been incurred and that can’t simply be cut.\n“By keeping (the debt ceiling) in place, we are choosing to flirt with an economic recession every time Republicans use it as political leverage,” Schatz said in a statement.\nIncreasing the debt limit is nothing new: it has been done many times  and under both Republican and Democratic administrations and Congresses  since the debt ceiling was enacted in 1917. However, proposals to abolish the debt limit entirely have been more controversial.\nSchatz first introduced a bill abolishing the debt ceiling in 2017 with only two cosponsors. He tried again in 2019, with a companion House bill introduced by Rep. Bill Foster, D-Illinois. The pair tried again unsuccessfully in 2021.\nDemocrats in 2021 also proposed the Debt Ceiling Reform Act, which would have repealed the debt ceiling and given the treasury secretary full authority to issue new debt if the president notified Congress that new debt is needed.\nLast fall, President Joe Biden called the idea of eliminating the debt ceiling “irresponsible,” after House Democrats led by Rep. Brendan Boyle, D-Pennsylvania, wrote a letter urging passage of the Debt Ceiling Reform Act.\nDenmark is the only other democratic country with a debt limit, although it does not pose the same issues as the debt ceiling in the United States. In Denmark, the debt limit is set far above the debt levels, according to the Atlantic Council. The country’s debt makes up 16% of its debt ceiling.\nIn addition to Van Hollen and Schatz, nine other Democrats are co-sponsoring the debt ceiling elimination bill: Sens. Bob Casey of Pennsylvania, Mazie Horono of Hawaii, Michael Bennet of Colorado, Ben Ray Lujan of New Mexico, Dick Durbin of Illinois, Martin Heinrich of New Mexico, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Chris Murphy of Connecticut and Tina Smith of Minnesota.\n“It’s dangerous and fiscally irresponsible to play games with the debt ceiling at the risk of our nation’s economic well being,” Durbin said."

    "title": "Biden infrastructure program so far has sent $2.6 billion to Maryland",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  President Joe Biden’s infrastructure program so far has funneled $2.6 billion over the last two years to projects in Maryland, according to White House data.\nThe Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, signed by Biden in November 2021, has been touted as a once-in-a-generation piece of legislation and the president is highlighting it as one of his key accomplishments as he makes his bid for reelection.\n“To have the strongest economy in the world…we need the best infrastructure in the world: roads, bridges, airports, water systems, high-speed Internet and so much more,” Biden told the North America’s Building Trades Unions legislative conference in Washington on Tuesday.\nThe White House so far has announced funding for 25,000 projects across the country, the president said.\nSen. Ben Cardin, D-Maryland, said in a statement that “the bipartisan infrastructure law is making transformative investments in Maryland and around the country.”\n“We are seeing the impact today from the earliest federal funding to be awarded on a competitive basis or apportioned through formula funding, and this process will continue in the years to come,” Cardin said.\n!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r=0;r\n“The infrastructure modernization law is building a stronger Maryland,” Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Maryland, said. “Just as important for Maryland, it is also helping reconnect communities divided by harmful infrastructure decisions of the past, combat the climate crisis, and support crucial economic drivers in our state like the Port of Baltimore and a healthy Chesapeake Bay.”\nMaryland’s second-largest county, Prince George’s, has received nearly $103 million for 41 projects, according to White House data. $56.4 million for roads, bridges and major projects, $25 million for public transportation and $21.3 million for safety, which includes transportation and water safety.\n“This money will allow Prince George’s County to build new and repair existing infrastructure all while creating good-paying jobs,” said Rep. Glenn Ivey, D-Maryland, whose district includes the county. “Prince George’s County has been historically redlined, and this is an opportunity to help right that wrong while reconnecting the communities that have been cut off by historic disinvestment.”\nNearly $21 million will go to a new, multimodal facility at the New Carrollton Station to connect Amtrak, MARC and Metrorail trains with the future Metro Purple Line as well as Greyhound and local bus services.\nPrince George’s County also has been awarded $25 million to buy electric-powered buses and to upgrade systems to support those buses.\nBaltimore County has received $55.2 million and Dorchester County, Maryland’s fourth-smallest county according to 2020 Maryland census data, has received $47.6 million.\nHowever, 98 percent of Dorchester County’s money comes from one $46.5 million project for the restoration of parts of Barren Island and James Island.\nIn a fact sheet on infrastructure projects, the Biden administration said that in the last decade, Maryland had experienced 33 extreme weather events, costing the state up to $5 billion in damages. The administration and Congress allocated funds to strengthen infrastructure (what is termed “resilience”) against the effects of climate change, severe weather and potential cyberattacks. Maryland has received $341 million for such work.\nMontgomery County, the state’s largest county, has received $24.7 million. Its main project covers $14.9 million for grants to buy low- or no-emission buses, with an additional $8.8 million going to roads and bridges in the county.\nOne of the state’s main projects is the Frederick Douglass Tunnel Project, which includes two new, high-capacity tunnels for electrified passenger trains that will improve the speed and capacity of the rail system. The project is slated to receive $4 billion.\nWhen Biden visited Baltimore in January, he highlighted the much-needed improvements to the current tunnel, which he traveled through for decades as an Amtrak passenger. The new tunnel will be renamed to honor Douglass.\nOther Maryland-specific spending includes:\n $144 million for clean water projects, including replacing lead pipes\n $25 million for improvements to Baltimore Washington International Airport\n $84 million in Chesapeake Bay ecosystem restoration\n $65 million to upgrade the energy grid, expand clean-energy technologies and weatherize homes\n $22.7 million to install electric vehicle charging stations around the state\n $4.8 million for ports and waterways projects\n $4.8 million to cap old oil and gas wells\n $500,000 to clean up Superfund and brownfield sites\n“The federal government has a special responsibility and a financial stake in WMATA/Metro,” Cardin said in a statement. “Years of neglectful decisions cannot be reversed overnight. But a safe and reliable Metro is integral to the federal government and the Washington region.”\n“We are rebuilding roads and bridges and ports and airports,” Vice President Kamala Harris said last week at an event where she announced nearly $300 dollars in funding for nine projects nationwide. “We are laying thousands of miles of fiber optic cable to connect families to high speed internet. We are removing every lead pipe in our nation so that our babies can drink clean water and live up to their God-given potential.”"

    "title": "Cardin gives racial and religious profiling bill another chance",
    "content": "WASHINGTON – Sen. Ben Cardin, D-Maryland, has reintroduced his bill to ban racial and religious profiling in all levels of law enforcement, just months after protests over the death of Tyre Nichols, a Black man who died of injuries after being stopped and beaten by Memphis Police officers.\nThe End Racial and Religious Profiling Act of 2023 would prohibit racial profiling by law enforcement, which the legislation defines as “targeting on the basis of actual or perceived race, ethnicity, nationality, religion, gender, gender identity, or sexual orientation.”\nThe legislation was previously passed by the House in 2020 and 2021 Congresses as part of the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act. The measure aimed to ban the use of chokeholds and no-knock warrants by federal law enforcement agents, but did not advance in the Senate.\n“Racial and religious profiling is a scourge to law enforcement that breeds distrust within communities, damages the reputation of all officers and far too often, takes lives,” Cardin said in a statement.\n“We think that racial profiling really robs people of dignity and undermines our criminal legal system, and instills fear and distress among members of many marginalized communities, especially black and brown communities,” Chloé White, senior policy counsel for justice at the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, told Capital News Service. Her organization has backed the bill each time it has been introduced.\nThe bill would implement mandatory training on racial profiling issues for federal law enforcement agencies. These agencies would also have to submit data to the Justice Department on all random or routine investigations that officers make.\nIn some locations, the rates of police pulling people over during the day versus at night are very different. A Stanford study showed that Black people are less likely to be stopped after sunset despite being stopped more frequently than White people during the day. Comparing the rates in many locations, there is “an extreme bias” in the daytime versus nighttime, when race is less visible, White said.\nUnder the bill, the Justice Department would be authorized to provide grants to aid in the implementation of better policing practices. The attorney general would also be required to regularly provide reports to assess any potential profiling practices.\nThe legislation also would allow the Justice Department or individuals who are harmed by potential violations of the legislation to seek “injunctive or declaratory relief in courts of law.”\nIn November, Cardin led a letter to Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas and Attorney General Merrick Garland, urging them to follow President Joe Biden’s guidance issued in May 2022 to prevent discriminatory profiling.\n“Discriminatory profiling is unjust in its targeting of minority communities, ineffective in stopping criminal or terrorist activities, inconsistent with American values, and wasteful of limited government resources,” Cardin and 12 other senators said in the letter.\nAs part of the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, Cardin previously also introduced the Law Enforcement Trust and Integrity Act, which aimed to address police misconduct by creating uniform national standards for police departments.\n“There is always a lot of fighting when it comes to transforming the criminal legal system, or even if we’re just talking about the portion that is law enforcement and policing,” White said. “I think there is always great resistance to that, whether its because of fears of political setbacks or insistence that racism is not pervasive in our society. And so its not the bill that needs to change. Its the minds of lawmakers that need to change.”\nSen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Maryland, is among the 15 cosponsors of the legislation. The others are Sens. Alex Padilla, D-California; Richard Blumenthal, D-Connecticut; Tim Kaine, D-Virginia; Ed Markey, D-Massachusetts; Sheldon Whitehouse, D-Rhode Island; Bernie Sanders, I-Vermont; Tammy Duckworth, D-Illinois; Ben Ray Lujan, D-New Mexico; Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii; Jeff Merkley, D-Oregon; Ron Wyden, D-Oregon; Elizabeth Warren, D-Massachusetts; Dick Durbin, D-Illinois, and Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio."

    "content": "WASHINGTON  A resolution to recognize the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) as the 28th Amendment to the United States Constitution failed to clear a procedural vote in the Senate Thursday. The Senate voted 51-47 in favor of the bipartisan resolution introduced by Sen. Ben Cardin, D-Maryland, but fell nine votes shy of the 60 vote threshold needed to clear a filibuster. As the vote came to a close and it became all but certain that the resolution would not receive the requisite 60 votes, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-New York, changed his vote to a “no” so he could make a motion to reconsider the resolution at a later time this session.At a press conference following the vote, Cardin struck a note of optimism as he emphasized the historic nature of the vote.“When I started a decade ago trying to get this resolution passed, I had 17 cosponsors,” Cardin told a crowd outside of the United States Capitol. “Today, we have 53 senators who have expressed their support. This is not the end. We will never stop until we have equality and the Equal Rights Amendment as a part of the Constitution.” The resolution would have waived the arbitrary 1982 deadline for 38 states to ratify the amendment and would recognize the Equal Rights Amendment as a valid part of the Constitution. In 2020, Virginia became the 38th state to ratify the ERA, nearly 40 years after the 1982 deadline expired. “Now, there is no good reason that we bind ourselves to limitations that were said 50 years ago by politicians who are long gone to prevent us today from guaranteeing equality for women and we are going to fight and fight and fight until we win,” Schumer said, referring to the ratification deadline. “This is what America is all about.”The push to recognize the ERA in the Senate came together quickly, following an announcement Monday by Schumer that there would be a vote this week.Prior to the vote, Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, a sponsor of the bill alongside Cardin and one of only two Republicans voting in favor of the resolution, indicated that she felt the vote had been rushed. “I’m not entirely pleased with the timing of our debate here on the resolution because we have not yet secured the 60 votes needed for its passage,  Murkowski said on the Senate floor. “I don’t really like it being used as filler on the floor, as somewhat of an exercise that runs the clock on a largely empty legislative calendar. I don’t see how the ERA or women in this country will ultimately benefit from that. But I am proud to lead this resolution with Senator Cardin.”Although the resolution was supported by a majority of senators, its failure highlighted the challenges presented by the filibuster. Zakiya Thomas, president and CEO of the ERA Coalition/Fund for Women’s Equality told reporters after the vote: “The Equal Rights Amendment didn’t fall short today. Democracy did.” Members of the newly formed House ERA Caucus were on hand for the Senate vote Thursday and as Cardin spoke before the vote, protesters chanting “ERA! Now!” could be heard loud and clear in the Senate chamber. Later in the proceedings, a protester was removed from the Senate gallery after she began shouting at Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and demanding recognition of the ERA."

    "title": "His chemotherapy over, Maryland’s Raskin says his cancer is &#8216;in remission’",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  Five months after receiving his cancer diagnosis, Maryland Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin announced Thursday that he completed chemotherapy treatment and his cancer is “in remission.”\nRaskin, 60, currently has no discernible cancer cells, according to a public letter the congressman shared Thursday. There is a 90% likelihood that his cancer will not return, he said.\nRaskin, who represents Maryland’s 8th congressional district, was diagnosed with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma in December and started chemotherapy shortly after. At the time, he described the diagnosis as a “serious but curable” form of cancer.\n“I am overwhelmed with gratitude and love,” Raskin wrote in the open letter. “Not just for my family, my friends, my constituents and my colleagues but for the many thousands of people – both Marylanders and those of you living much further away – who have reached out to me over the last five months.”\nThe fourth-term congressman expressed gratitude for the thousands of constituents, colleagues and Americans across the country who reached out with support and encouragement.\nIn the letter, Raskin highlighted his appreciation for his now-signature bandanas, as well as gifts such as scarves, hats, paintings and food that supporters gifted to him during his time in treatment.\nThe congressman has seldom been seen without a bandana on Capitol Hill since beginning chemotherapy – even sporting one given to him by rock musician Steven Van Zandt, who inspired the look. He has relied on the fashion accessory to deal with hair loss from treatment, Raskin said in a February tweet.\nRaskin previously went through radiation and chemotherapy after receiving a colon cancer diagnosis while serving as a Maryland state senator in 2010.\nThe congressman is currently recovering from his final round of chemotherapy, he said.\n“I lack the energy to properly thank you all and express the enormity of my feelings about the enduring beauty and promise of our country,” Raskin said. “In the meantime, I just want to send you my profound appreciation.”"

    "title": "Maryland&#8217;s Ivey wants federal law raising age to 21 for semiautomatic rifle and shotgun buys",
    "content": "WASHINGTON – Introducing his first bill, Rep. Glenn Ivey, D-Maryland, on Wednesday proposed raising the minimum age to purchase semiautomatic centerfire rifles and semiautomatic centerfire shotguns to 21.  Ivey’s Raise the Age Act’s minimum age requirement would match the minimum age required to purchase a handgun from a gun dealer with a federal license, which is 21. Exceptions to the proposed law would be active duty military personnel and full-time law enforcement officers.  Semiautomatic rifles can release up to 45 rounds per minute, and there is “no justification for a teen to have access to a weapon of this caliber,” Ivey tweeted.  During a House floor speech Wednesday, Ivey addressed some of the country’s biggest mass shootings at Sandy Hook Elementary School, Marjorie Stoneman Douglas High School and Columbine High School, all of which were committed by 18-, 19- and 20-year-olds. “Some of my colleagues insist on choosing the Second Amendment over second graders,” Ivey said. “They insist on banning books instead of banning assault weapons.”During a Capitol press conference, Ivey was joined by Rep. Mike Thompson, D-California, who is co-sponsor of the bill and chairman of the House Gun Violence Prevention Task Force, and Adzi Vokhiwa, the federal affairs director at Giffords, a gun violence prevention organization. “We can’t stay where we are,” Ivey said. “We’re having almost a mass shooting every day, probably almost two mass shootings a day here in the United States. We’ve got to take some steps to try and address it.”  “This is a community safety bill,” Thompson said. “This is smart legislation, it was legislation that was in our Child Safety Act last year… It’s one that we need to take up now and pass on to save lives.”The House Gun Violence Prevention Task Force was formed after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting. The task force works within their communities and with outside groups to figure out which “pieces of responsible gun violence prevention legislation would pass, and should pass,” Thompson said. Giffords, one of the legislation’s supporters, celebrates its 10-year anniversary this year, which Ivey noted during his introduction of the bill. “Unfortunately, we’ve seen all too often that people 18 to 20 have committed horrific acts of violence. We’ve seen it in Parkland, in Uvalde…in Santa Fe, Texas and many, many other mass shootings,” Vokhiwa told reporters. According to Vokhiwa, people between the ages of 18 and 21 only make up 4% of the population, but are responsible for 17% of homicides. Ivey has not yet been able to garner bipartisan support for the bill, but he said he has reached out to Republican legislators on the House Judiciary Committee. Some have said they would be willing to have conversations, he said. “They’re doing active shooter drills in schools now, which has to be scary,” Ivey said in an interview with Capital News Service. “When I was a kid we did fire drills, now they’re doing active shooter drills instead…I think the real obvious answer is to try and restrict the access to these semiautomatic weapons that are being used in school shootings.”In February, Ivey along with other Maryland members of Congress announced over $5.1 million in federal funding from the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act to support gun violence prevention programs across the state."

    "content": "GREENBELT, Md. – The United States and South Korea have signed an agreement to cooperate on space exploration, Vice President Kamala Harris announced Tuesday at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center.\nThe Joint Statement of Intent for Cooperation on Space Exploration and Science would enhance future space exploration through mutual areas of interest, including space communications and navigation, technology research on the Moon and astrophysics.\nHarris was joined by South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol on a tour of Goddard’s facilities, where they received briefings on cooperative space efforts and discussed future partnerships in space.\n“This year, we celebrate the 70th anniversary of the alliance between the United States and South Korea, which has been a linchpin of security and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific and around the world,” Harris said.\nThe U.S.-South Korea space alliance is growing across sectors, including civil and commercial space travel and national security, Harris said, and the two nations are strategizing to address the climate crisis together.\n“Together our nations have built and placed satellites into orbit that can track air pollution in North America and Asia,” said Harris said. “Today I have also directed the National Space Council, which I lead, to expand this network to ensure that it also covers the southern hemisphere.”\nLast year South Korea placed in lunar orbit a satellite that carries a high-resolution camera from NASA in search of water in shadowed areas on the Moon.\nSouth Korea also plans to partner with NASA to send scientific payloads through NASA’s Commercial Lunar Payload Services, which Harris considers “our version of a rideshare program for space exploration.”\nNASA and South Korea are expanding collaboration on the Artemis mission, which will send astronauts to the Moon for the first time in 50 years, and will provide groundwork for future missions to Mars.\nYoon said he is “delighted” that the Artemis program is off to a successful start, adding that he was inspired by his visit to Goddard to continue pursuing space exploration.\n“I’ve always believed that mankind’s future lies in space, and with that conviction in mind, last year I laid out the space economy roadmap,” Yoon said. “Under that vision, we are in the process of establishing a Korean version of NASA.”\nThe joint statement will “serve as a springboard” for taking the United States and South Korea, as well as their allies, to a “next level” space alliance for exploration and peaceful use of outer space, Yoon said.\n“Our task is to work together to guide your humanity forward, safely and sustainably and peacefully, into this new frontier,” Harris said."

    "title": "Senate will vote on Cardin&#8217;s Equal Rights Amendment resolution this week",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-New York, announced Monday that the Senate will vote this week on whether to recognize the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) as the 28th Amendment to the United States Constitution. \nThe bipartisan resolution introduced by Sens. Ben Cardin, D-Maryland, and Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, would waive the 1982 deadline for ratification of the ERA previously set by Congress. The 38-state ratification threshold was not reached until 2020 when Virginia approved the ERA nearly two decades after the deadline. \n“There should be no deadline on equality. The states have done their job ratifying the amendment and now it’s time for Congress to recognize that fact,” Cardin said in a statement to Capital News Service. “We know that a majority of senators support our bipartisan amendment. I am hopeful that we will have sufficient Republican support for our resolution given that Congress changed the deadline once before, so it should be able to follow that same precedent and change the deadline again.”\nNot only do a majority of senators support the resolution, but 52 of them are co-sponsoring the resolution. However, it has yet to be seen whether the resolution can clear the 60 votes needed to overcome a filibuster in the Senate.  A corresponding resolution has been introduced in the House by Rep. Ayanna Pressley, D-Massachusetts, along with 183 cosponsors. \nThere is opposition in the Senate to the push to recognize the ERA. Sens. Cindy Hyde-Smith, R-Mississippi, and John Kennedy, R-Louisiana, have introduced a competing resolution to recognize the deadline for ratification of the amendment as having expired. The bill has 17 cosponsors, all of whom are Republicans.\n“Things have improved over the years, but we still have a long way to go when it comes to achieving equality for women,” Murkowski said in a statement.  “And I think we need the Equal Rights Amendment to get there.”\nAfter Virginia became the 38th state to ratify the ERA in 2020, a legal battle began to have the amendment recognized as part of the Constitution, in spite of the congressionally-mandated deadline. In January 2020, the Trump Justice Department issued an opinion stating that the 1982 deadline is binding and that Congress must start the amendment process from scratch if it wishes to revive the ERA. \nThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled in February that the 1982 deadline stands, dealing a major blow to the legal movement to advance the ERA. Activists subsequently pivoted their attention to Congress and have found a receptive audience among most Democratic and some Republican lawmakers. \n“I think it is significant,” Caroline Fredrickson, a visiting professor at Georgetown Law and a senior fellow at the Brennan Center for Justice, told CNS regarding the Senate vote. “Theres a strong argument that the ERA is already ratified.  Having the Senate underscore that belief would not only enhance that legal understanding but add force to those who are working to make its protections available in reality.” \nIn spite of legal setbacks, womens rights advocates maintain that the ERA has fulfilled all of the requirements to become a part of the Constitution and that Congress should adopt that position. \n“The ERA has already fulfilled all requirements to become an amendment to the Constitution, and this resolution would affirm that fact; empowering Congress and the courts to pursue protections against sex discrimination with full constitutional backing  something long overdue for the United States,” Zakiya Thomas, president and CEO of the ERA Coalition and Fund for Women’s Equality, told CNS. “One hundred years is too long to wait for equality.\nThe Equal Rights Amendment was first introduced in 1923, but it has gained new currency on Capitol Hill in the aftermath of the Supreme Court’s ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, which overturned the constitutional right to an abortion. Lawmakers have since moved to shore up rights which could be subject to reinterpretation by the Supreme Court’s conservative supermajority, such as marriage equality. \nLast month,  Democratic members of the House of Representatives announced the formation of the first House ERA Caucus, dedicated to achieving recognition of the ERA by Congress."

    "title": "Maryland’s Cardin and Van Hollen back bipartisan act to ban congressional stock trading",
    "content": "WASHINGTON – Maryland Sens. Ben Cardin and Chris Van Hollen have joined 19 of their colleagues in introducing legislation that would prohibit members of Congress, their spouses and dependent children from trading stocks.\n“Ethics matter. Members of Congress are public servants who should not be making a profit off of the official information we gain by doing our jobs,” Cardin said in a statement.\nThe Ending Trading and Holdings in Congressional Stocks (ETHICS) Act was introduced last week by Democratic Sens. Sen. Jeff Merkley of Oregon and Sherrod Brown of Ohio.\n“Members of Congress have a responsibility to act in the best interest of the American people — not their personal financial portfolios,” Van Hollen said in a statement. “By removing any financial conflicts of interest and increasing transparency, Congress can better serve our constituents and uphold the public trust.”\nIdentical legislation was introduced in the House by Reps. Raja Krishnamoorthi, D-Illinois, and Michael Cloud, R-Texas.\nIn January, a bipartisan group of House members reintroduced the Transparent Representation Upholding Service and Trust in Congress (TRUST) Act. The bill would ban members of Congress from trading stocks while in office, but still would permit them to put certain assets in a blind trust. Supporters of the bill ranged from Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Florida, to Rep. Raúl Grijalva, D-Arizona, a member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus.\nThe Project On Government Oversight (POGO), a nonpartisan watchdog organization, backs the ETHICS Act.\n“It’s, frankly, a class divide,” Dylan Hedtler-Gaudette, POGO government affairs manager, told Capital News Service. “If you’re a wealthier member of Congress, you’re often a little bit more opposed to these kinds of things because you have a lot more to lose from these restrictions.”\nHedtler-Gaudette said restricting lawmakers from trading stocks has broad public support, which could increase the likelihood of the bill’s passage.\nA poll conducted by the Trafalgar Group found that 70 percent of Democrats, 78 percent of Republicans and nearly 80 percent of independents say members of Congress should not be allowed to trade stocks.\n“People need to have confidence that policymakers are making decisions about what’s best for the country, not what’s best for their stock portfolios,” Brown said in a press conference last Tuesday.\nAlthough stock trading is not currently prohibited, members of Congress are required to publicly file and disclose any financial transaction within 45 days of its occurrence, according to a law passed by lawmakers and signed by President Barack Obama in 2012.\nThat law, called the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge (STOCK) Act, currently requires members of Congress to pay $200 for every 30 days that they fail to comply with the rules. The ETHICS Act would change the fine to $500 per case when a member of Congress does not comply with the STOCK Act."

    "content": "WASHINGTON  The Biden administration is urging Congress to give Justice Department prosecutors broader authority to prosecute Russians for crimes against humanity in connection with the war in Ukraine, particularly crimes involving the removal of thousands of Ukrainian children to Russia.\nAlthough Secretary of State Antony Blinken in February declared that “members of Russia’s forces and other Russian officials have committed crimes against humanity in Ukraine,” federal prosecutors do not have the legal authority to pursue such cases.\nDeputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco urged the Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday to enact a “crimes against humanity” statute.\n“It is unthinkable, it’s almost unimaginable, but yet we know it’s occurring  the forcible removal, the disappearing of children from Ukraine by Russian forces,” Monaco told senators. “We are doing everything we can within the tools that we have  (using) the war crimes investigators.…But the single thing I think that this Congress could do to help us more would be to pass a crimes against humanity statute.”\nSuch a law would allow the Justice Department to prosecute individuals for “widespread, systematic attacks that are politically motivated against a civilian population, in this case, children.”\n“We need the capability and the authority to bring those crimes against humanity…because that’s what it is, it is crimes against humanity  the most atrocious, heinous type of crime that can be committed,” Monaco said. \nThe chairman of the judiciary panel, Sen.

    "title": "High court’s loan relief decision could exacerbate existing mental health crisis",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  Growing up as the oldest child in a single-parent home, Brittani Williams longed to leave her Baton Rouge, Louisiana, home for better opportunities and challenged herself to be a role model for her siblings. \n“It was my charge given to me by me to get a college degree so that I could show my siblings that they could do the same,” said Williams, who is now a senior policy analyst in higher education for The Education Trust, an advocacy organization that promotes educational equity.\nAlthough going to college changed her life, the financial impact was stressful. \n“Im a student loan borrower. I didnt want to be, but because of the circumstances, the lack of wealth in my family, I had to be a borrower,” Williams said. “That was my choice, my option, because (not) getting a college degree was not an option for me.” \nHer experience is far from isolated: 45 million Americans have federal student loan debt totaling $1.6 trillion, according to the White House. \nAnd research and polling has shown that student debt is linked to increased anxiety and depression. An upcoming Supreme Court decision on student debt relief could only add to the stress.\nTo address the rising amount of higher education debt, President Joe Biden introduced a student loan relief plan in August 2022 that would forgive up to $10,000 in debt per individual and $20,000 for those who received a Pell Grant. \nBut now, two legal challenges to the plan have reached the Supreme Court, which could shut down the forgiveness plan. \n“​​People take out student loans with huge hopes and dreams. Its supposed to get them through this degree thats going to launch them into a career and help them achieve the American dream,” said Sabrina Cereceres, special project manager at the Student Debt Crisis Center, an organization that helps student loan borrowers navigate repayment options. \n“(But) when it comes to time to repay their loans, theyre making payments, theyre trying to navigate this repayment system, and then, you know, a lot of these borrowers just see their account balances go up and up,” Cereceres said. \nBorrowers are now anxiously awaiting the Supreme Court’s ruling decisions on whether the federal loan forgiveness plan is valid. \nThe legal challenges come in the midst of an existing mental health crisis.\nA majority of Americans  54%  has reported experiencing mental health issues related to student debt, according to a September poll by ELVTR, a virtual learning platform.\nThe survey of 2,000 people between 18 and 67 with some college experience revealed that 56% said they suffered anxiety due to their student debt; 32% reported depression, 20% insomnia and 17% panic attacks.  \nThe mental toll of student debt especially affects Black borrowers and students who come from low-wealth backgrounds, who are already disproportionately undertreated for mental health. \nIn many studies and research papers that have investigated this phenomenon, two major solutions to the stress of student loans are getting assistance from parental wealth and securing high-paying jobs. \nThe Supreme Court heard arguments on Feb. 28 in two legal cases challenging the constitutionality of Biden’s plan. Protesters and leaders from advocacy groups clustered around the court with colorful signs and loudspeakers, chanting in the direction of the justices inside to allow the relief plan to go through. \nThe uncertainty of policy surrounding college affordability and whether loans will be forgiven may even add to existing anxiety for borrowers, according to Erica White, a research scholar at the Center for Public Health Law and Policy. \nMany borrowers don’t even know when they’ll have to start payments again as the Biden administration has continued to push a COVID-19 emergency loan payment pause into 2023. Waiting , and waiting for a high court decision adds to that unpredictability, she said. \n“Theyre just feeling very jaded with the Supreme Court,” White said. “I would imagine that just adds to the lack of trust and the stress that everyone is experiencing right now.”\nStudent debt is a public health concern, according to White. \n“This court is just really not motivated by public health data,” White said. \nEven if the conservative majority on the Supreme Court invalidates Biden’s plan, Williams said that she and other advocates will continue to explore other alternatives to make college more affordable. \n“We, as in stakeholders in higher education reform, we should not count it as a loss because there is more work to be done,” Williams said. “I think that my message would be, you know, to be hopeful.”"

    "title": "Maryland Democrats defend abortion drug in brief to Supreme Court",
    "content": "WASHINGTON – Maryland’s Democrats in Congress have joined an amicus brief to the Supreme Court opposing lower court rulings that would prohibit or restrict the sale of the abortion pill mifepristone.\nSenate Democrats and independents and House Democrats argued that the “FDA’s determination that mifepristone is safe and effective is based on a thorough and comprehensive review process prescribed and overseen by the legislative branch.”\n“Since mifepristone’s initial approval in 2000, FDA has repeatedly and consistently affirmed that the medication is safe and effective for its approved conditions of use,” the lawmakers said.  “FDA’s process and conclusions have been validated by both Congress and the Government Accountability Office  and by the lived experience of over 5 million patients who have used the drug in the United States.”\nThe Justice Department on Friday filed a brief with the Supreme Court seeking to block a Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals ruling restricting use of the drug. Later the same day, Justice Samuel Alito placed a temporary hold until Wednesday night on the lower court’s ruling.\nIn her brief to the Supreme Court, Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar cited “unprecedented lower court orders countermanding FDA’s scientific judgment and unleashing regulatory chaos by suspending the existing FDA-approved conditions of use for mifepristone.”\n“To the government’s knowledge,” she said, “this is the first time any court has abrogated FDA’s conditions on a drug’s approval based on a disagreement with the agency’s judgment about safety  much less done so after those conditions have been in effect for years.”\nThe Fifth Circuit ruling effectively would limit access to the drug, barring distribution of the pill by mail and shortening the period during which the pill could be used. But the appeals panel stopped short of agreeing with U.S. District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk, who earlier ruled that mifepristone should be banned because the FDA incorrectly approved the drug nearly 23 years ago.\nThe FDA previously removed restrictions that required in-person doctor visits to prescribe the pill, extended its use through 10 weeks gestation and permitted dispensing the pill by mail.\nNine Democratic members of the Maryland congressional delegation were among 50 senators and 203 House members signing the amicus brief: Sens. Ben Cardin and Chris Van Hollen, and Reps. Steny Hoyer, Glenn Ivey, Kweisi Mfume, Jamie Raskin, Dutch Ruppersberger, John Sarbanes and David Trone.\nRep. Andy Harris, the sole Republican in the Maryland delegation, has supported legislation restricting abortions. In September 2022, Harris co-sponsored a House bill that would limit abortions after 15 weeks.\n“The consequences of the Fifth Circuit’s decision could extend far beyond mifepristone, for it undermines the science-based, expert-driven process that Congress designed for determining whether drugs are safe and effective,” the lawmakers’ brief said. “By permitting the district court to disrupt FDA’s current regulation of mifepristone, the Fifth Circuit has countenanced judicial interference that erroneously substitutes the district court’s judgment for FDA’s scientific determination.”\nThe senators and House members added: “Providers and patients rely on the availability of thousands of FDA-approved drugs to treat or manage a range of medical conditions, including asthma, HIV, infertility, heart disease, diabetes, and more. Moreover, the prospect of courts second-guessing FDA’s rigorous drug safety and effectiveness determinations will disrupt industry expectations and could chill pharmaceutical research and development.”\nLast year, Van Hollen and Cardin were original co-sponsors of the Women’s Health Protection Act, legislation that would codify the protections guaranteed under Roe v. Wade nationwide.\nMaryland Gov. Wes Moore on Friday announced a partnership with the University of Maryland Medical System to secure supplies mifepristone.\nMaryland is going to lead on this, Moore said Sunday on ABC News’s “This Week.”\nIn 2020, medication abortion (mifepristone and misoprostol) accounted for 53% of all facility-based abortions, according to research by the Guttmacher Institute."

    "title": "Harris touts new bridge funding as she wraps national infrastructure tour",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  As part of the Biden administration’s infrastructure agenda, Vice President Kamala Harris on Thursday announced nearly $300 million in federal funding for nine major bridge projects in the nation’s capital and eight states.\nStanding near the aging 14th Street Bridge that connects downtown Washington to Arlington in northern Virginia, Harris said the span will receive $72 million to restore the structure’s weakening supports, which carry over 88,000 vehicles per day.\n“Across our nation, we are investing in building a better future for our nation,” Harris said, “and this bridge that has gone decades without urgently needed repairs is evidence of that progress.”\nThe 14th Street Bridge, less familiarly known as the Arland D. Williams Jr. Memorial Bridge, actually consists of three spans. Opened in 1950, the bridge is one of just seven highway bridges over the Potomac River linking Washington and neighboring Maryland suburbs to Virginia. (The capital and Virginia also are linked by a railroad bridge and a Metro bridge.)\n“Most of us know how important this bridge is, particularly those of us who live in this region,” U.S. Deputy Secretary of Transportation Polly Trottenberg said. “We know what a critical link it is between D.C. and northern Virginia as Capitol Hill residents travel in our region.”\n“We have witnessed a gradual return to traffic volume of pre-pandemic levels on our roadways on our bridges and overpasses,” said Everett Lott, director of the District Department of Transportation, “emphasizing the urgent need for price-scale investments in our transportation infrastructure.”\nLott said that over 630,000 jobs are located within three miles of either side of the14th Street Bridge.\nThe Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which includes $40 billion to repair or replace bridges across the country, will help create jobs and provide improved access to rural and urban communities, according to the Biden administration, which said it has funded over 4,600 bridge repair and replacement projects nationwide.\nEven so, more than 43,000 bridges in poor condition across the United States still need repair, the White House said.\nThe White House also announced that Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg would visit upstate New York, where the infrastructure law funds projects, including the Castleton-on-Hudson Bridge near Albany, which serves roughly 17,000 vehicles daily. The project is set to receive $21 million.\nSenior Advisor and White House Infrastructure Coordinator Mitch Landrieu will visit Madison, Wisconsin, where the John Nolen Drive Bridges will get $15.1 million to replace six bridges that serve 45,000 vehicles per day.\n“It is because of these investments all across our nation,” Harris said, “we are rebuilding roads and bridges and ports and airports.”\nHarris also announced funding for these projects:\n# $24 million for improvements to the Palm Avenue Overcrossing Bridge in San Diego.\n# $73 million to replace the 85-year-old Lafayette Avenue Bascule Bridge in Bay City, Michigan.\n# $11.5 million to replace seven rural bridges in northwest Oklahoma.\n# $13.9 million to replace a 93-year-old viaduct at the Burgard Bridge in Portland, Oregon.\n# $51.2 million to replace six aging rural bridges in northwest South Carolina.\n# $14 million to replace the US-59 San Antonio River Bridge in San Antonio, Texas.\nHarris’s comments concluded a three-week tour in which senior White House officials, including President Joe Biden, traveled across the country to announce funding for various infrastructure projects.\nThe infrastructure law includes the new Bridge Formula Program, which the Department of Transportation launched at the start of 2022. It provides funding to repair bridges over five years, including $5.5 billion in 2022. Another $5.5 billion was released for 2023, according to the White House."

    "title": "Cardin, Trone introduce bills to address education inequities, increase federal funding",
    "content": "WASHINGTON – Sen. Ben Cardin and Rep. David Trone, both Maryland Democrats, have proposed legislation aimed at addressing educational inequities and eliminating academic achievement gaps.\nThe TRUE EQUITY Act, whose full title is ​​Transformational Reforms and Updates to Ensure Educational Quality and Urgent Investments in Today’s Youth Act of 2023, would provide $1.4 billion in federal grants for states and local communities that prioritize education policy changes and address education inequities in traditionally underserved areas.\n“Maryland students deserve the very best public education, and we are united in this fight for the federal government to be a strong partner in the positive transformation of our schools,” Cardin and Trone said in a statement last month. “The TRUE EQUITY Act establishes a stronger federal partnership with state and local communities dedicated to providing their children a world-class education.”\nThe legislation parallels policy recommendations of the Maryland Commission on Innovation  Excellence in Education’s Blueprint for Maryland’s Future. Passed by the Maryland General Assembly in 2021, the Blueprint will make major changes to the Maryland public education system over a decade with annual education funding increases of $3.8 billion.\n“Its a mirror image in some ways, in terms of the priorities in the federal legislation,” Ellie Mitchell, co-chair of the Maryland Education Coalition, told Capital News Service. “I think its designed really to think about trying to take a little bit of the load off of the state burden that is created by the Kirwan Commission in the Blueprint… So I’m sure the intent is to find a way to do some federal offset to this huge influx of state funding that is happening.”\nThe implementation costs of the Blueprint for Maryland’s Future Act would be partially covered by federal grants provided through the TRUE EQUITY Act.\nDuring March, initial implementation plans of the Blueprint for Maryland’s Future were due from local school districts, the Maryland State Department of Education and other agencies involved with implementing the Blueprint. Based on the legislation’s implementation timeline, by July 2026 the minimum teacher salary in every Maryland school district will be $60,000.\nWhile his legislation is based on Maryland’s education reform plan, “any state or local jurisdiction can apply for funding as long as they are open to strengthening intergovernmental partnerships that will further student achievement, eliminate disparities and provide a world-class public education to all students, Cardin said in a statement to CNS.\nThe COVID pandemic played a large role in furthering education disparities, especially for minority and low-income students, according to Cardin and Trone.\nIn an effort to reverse these effects and improve public school systems, the legislation would focus on five main areas.\nThese areas would include new grants to invest in early childhood education, funding additional teacher training, giving all students access to career and college pathways by 10th grade and funding programs that aim to reduce achievement gaps. The legislation would also require states applying for funding to form state oversight boards, which would hold state and local school districts accountable if they did not meet state educational equity goals.\nWe now know that COVID-19 exacerbated existing disparities and achievement gaps, so the additional support is all the more essential, Cardin said.\n“The teacher crisis is not a pandemic-created situation,” Mitchell agreed. “Thats something that weve been hurtling towards for a long time, in terms of teacher shortages, and also in terms of not having the diverse workforce that we want within education.”\nThe Maryland Education Coalition’s mission is primarily to ensure sufficient funding and equitable policies with transparent accountability in public education, based on the Maryland Constitution, which requires a “thorough and efficient set of free public schools,” said co-chair Rick Tyler Jr.\nTyler said he hopes that the Maryland congressional delegation will be able to win support from colleagues from other states.\n“I will also say that Maryland historically has been a leader in education reform nationally. My initial understanding I have is that many other states are looking at what Maryland is doing,” said Tyler. “That may be another way where they will join in and support this legislation.”\nThe measure also drew praise from Cheryl Bost, president of the Maryland State Education Association.\n“The TRUE EQUITY Act will provide a true federal partnership with our state and local efforts to eliminate academic disparities across racial and socioeconomic lines and elevate the teaching profession,” Bost said in a statement.\nMaryland Democratic Sen. Chris Van Hollen and Maryland Democratic Reps. Steny Hoyer, Dutch Ruppersberger, John Sarbanes, Kweisi Mfume, Jamie Raskin and Glenn Ivey also back the legislation."

    "title": "NASA ready to try out 1,700-square-foot Mars habitat in year-long Earth-bound mission",
    "content": "HOUSTON – A team of four crew members soon will embark on a groundbreaking one-year mission inside a Mars simulated habitat at NASA’s Johnson Space Center this summer as part of the agency’s preparations for future human missions to the red planet.\nThe habitat test run, known as the Crew Health and Performance Exploration Analog (CHAPEA), will be the first of three planned missions in Mars Dune Alpha, a 3D-printed lavacrete structure similar to what NASA may build in the future on the surface of Mars.\n“We are selecting crew that are astronaut-like and they will be living here in the Mars Dune Alpha in isolation and confinement for that year,” said Grace Douglas, CHAPEA’s principal investigator. “They will be conducting activities similar to what we would expect them to conduct on Mars’s surface.”\nHOUSTON  Crew members will use equipment to simulate maintenance work on the outside of the Mars Dune Alpha habitat at the Johnson Space Center. (Destiny Herbers/Capital News Service)\nActivities include virtual reality simulated spacewalks or “Marswalks” in the environment’s 1,200 square-foot sandbox, robotic operations, and crop growth experiments. Crew members will conduct all these activities while facing challenges similar to those a human could expect on Mars.\nExperts across NASA have been developing the “very accurate” simulated Mars missions since late 2020, Douglas said, but an actual manned mission might come in the 2030s.\nThe planned CHAPEA missions will not be able to simulate Mars’s gravity, which is roughly a third of the Earth’s, due to technological restrictions, but the crew members will proceed on Marswalks as though they were experiencing those conditions.\nHOUSTON  Grace Douglas, CHAPEA’s principal investigator, shows where the crew members in NASA’s simulated Mars habitat at the Johnson Space Center will make building materials out of Mars-like sand. (Destiny Herbers/Capital News Service)\nIn the sandbox portion of the habitat, a thick layer of dyed red sand will slow down the crew member’s steps, as well as the heavy spacesuits they will wear each time they step out of Mars Dune Alpha.\nCrew members will use curved treadmills and wear virtual reality gear to simulate what walking and performing maintenance activities on Mars will feel like. The sandbox includes solar panels, a small greenhouse, and oxygen-gathering machinery that the crew will work on.\n“We thought through a few different types of spacewalks that we thought would be realistic to what astronauts would do on the surface of Mars,” Raina MacLeod, CHAPEA deputy project manager at Johnson said in a statement. “We would have them do geology work, and then they probably would do some building tasks, and then also exploration. So, those are the three categories we are looking at for CHAPEA – geology, building, and exploration.”\nDuring the mission, the crew members will control a helicopter-like drone and a roving robot by working in pairs inside the habitat to remotely operate the robots, surveying remote areas, collecting rock samples and documenting geological information.\nHOUSTON  Grace Douglas (left), CHAPEA’s principal investigator, and Sheena Dev, a scientist at NASA’s Behavioral Health and Performance Laboratory, explain how crew members will use the designated work space in the simulated Mars habitat, which includes a fitness room and medical bay. (Destiny Herbers/Capital News Service)\n“The robotics element is a very interesting activity that we are including for our crew. Its always good to have really stimulating tasks, especially on a long-duration analog study to keep the crew excited,” MacLeod said. “But these activities could also be very realistic in that future Mars astronauts could utilize remote piloting drones and rovers to expand the reconnaissance radius.”\nCHAPEA will help NASA to better understand risk and resource tradeoffs that may be faced on Mars to best support the crew’s health as the agency starts designing and planning for extended-duration Mars missions.\n“Our goal is to really understand that with the resource restrictions that we would put in place for a Mars mission, and with the performance that were expecting them to be able to complete cognitively and physically, are we able to support them adequately?” Douglas said.\nLiving quarters inside Mars Dune Alpha are tight, with a floor plan of only 1,700 square feet. In comparison, the median size of a single family home in the United States is 2,430 square feet, according to PropertyShark’s analysis.\nMars Dune Alpha’s interior includes four bedrooms, two bathrooms, a combined recreation area and kitchen, space for crop growth and food storage, as well as a separate work area with a fitness room and medical bay. The hallways are narrow, and the individual bedrooms fit a twin-sized bed without space for much else.\nCrew members “ideally” will have access to running water, Douglas said, but may lose access as they are subjected to Mars-realistic environmental stressors like equipment failure and resource limitations.\nAll communication between the crew members and the outside world will be time-delayed by roughly 20 minutes each direction to simulate the time it takes messages to travel from Mars to Earth. This will present a unique challenge for crew members because problem-solving with teams at mission control will involve about a 40-minute lag between each message.\nMental health is an important consideration for crew members during the mission due to the prolonged isolation and confinement, said Sheena Dev, a scientist at NASA’s Behavioral Health and Performance Laboratory.\nCrew members will be able to regularly speak with psychologists throughout the mission, although they will be subject to the communication time-delay.\nHOUSTON  Bathrooms in the simulated Mars habitat at the Johnson Space Center include showers and toilets, but the crew may face hygiene challenges with water restrictions and equipment failures. (Destiny Herbers/Capital News Service)\nThe CHAPEA team will be evaluating strategies for supporting both the behavioral health of individual crew members and the social support network among the crew over the course of a full year of isolation, Dev said, to plan for the eventual two-and-a-half year missions to Mars.\nProspective crew members for the CHAPEA missions are “astronaut-like” members of the general public who are selected through a series of physical and mental tests.\nNASA is expected to announce the four crew members and two alternates for the first mission in the coming weeks."

    "title": "Maryland Gov. Moore exploring abortion drug stockpile",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  In the wake of a federal district court ruling revoking FDA approval for a major abortion drug, Maryland Gov. Wes Moore is working with the state Department of Health to explore stockpiling the drug. \nLast Friday, Matthew Kacsmaryk, a conservative federal judge in Texas, ruled that the FDA should withdraw approval for mifepristone. The abortion pill has been on the market for 23 years and the ruling, which takes effect on Friday, represents an unprecedented challenge to the FDA’s authority. \nJust before departing for Northern Ireland on Tuesday, President Joe Biden called the ruling “completely out of bounds.”\nWhether the ruling will have any effect remains to be seen. \nMinutes after the ruling was handed down in Texas, a federal judge in Washington state issued a contradictory ruling which compels the FDA to ensure that mifepristone remains available. The decision in Texas will likely be appealed to the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals and possibly the United States Supreme Court. \nThe uncertainty over the status of the drug has led some Democratic governors to announce that they are building stockpiles of the drug in the event it should become unavailable federally. Governors in California, Massachusetts, Maine and Washington state have announced they will be stockpiling mifepristone in the wake of the Texas ruling. \nWhile Wes Moore’s office did not provide specifics on a potential stockpile, it did say the governor is exploring the issue with the Maryland Department of Health.\n“As other states work to tear down reproductive protections and attack access to care and medication, the Moore-Miller administration is exploring options to implement more safeguards for all Marylanders — including working with the Department of Health to explore stockpiling mifepristone,” a spokesperson for Moore told Capital News Service. \nPlanned Parenthood of Maryland told CNS that it will continue to offer mifepristone as long as the Washington court ruling stands, and that it will continue to provide other forms of medical abortion if mifepristone is removed from the market. \n“The banning of mifepristone is not only unprecedented — never before have we seen a medication with such long-standing FDA approval ripped from the U.S. market overnight — but is also based on exaggerated claims,” Planned Parenthood of Maryland CEO Karen Nelson said in a statement. “Mifepristone is safe, effective, and was used by more than 4 million people since its approval two decades ago. The truth of the matter is that this case is not motivated by concern for patient health as the plaintiff claimed. Instead it is a boldfaced attack on sexual and reproductive health care that will have dire consequences.”\nThe Maryland General Assembly has recently passed a constitutional amendment that would enshrine abortion rights in the state constitution. The bill is now headed to the governor’s office for Moore’s signature and then will be on the ballot for approval by Maryland voters in the 2024 general election. \nMoore’s office told CNS: “The governor will continue to do everything in his power to ensure that Maryland remains a safe haven for abortion and reproductive health care access, including signing into law a comprehensive and historic reproductive rights legislative package that will provide concrete protections for Marylanders’ reproductive freedoms; protect private medical information; expand access to reproductive health care services; and enable a ballot measure to enshrine reproductive rights in the Maryland constitution.”"

This will come as no surprise to residents of cities like Washington and Baltimore, where it is often difficult to see more than the moon.\nAlthough it may not garner the same popular attention as other forms of environmental degradation, light pollution has far-reaching impacts for Earth’s ecosystems and human health.\nAstronomers at the National Science Foundation’s NOIRLab (which stands for National Optical-Infrared Astronomy Research Laboratory) estimate that light pollution levels are increasing by 10% every year. Children born today in a city where 250 stars can be seen at night will only be able to see 100 by the time they turn 18.\nConnie Walker, a scientist at NOIRLab, told Capital News Service that increasing light pollution represents a lost cultural heritage.\n“Just think about (Gustav) Holst in creating the musical composition, ‘The Planets’, or (Vincent) Van Gogh, who did ‘The Starry Night.’ I mean, this is not just astronomy, its art. Its if we basically cut ourselves off from access to the night sky, were really damaging the opportunities for future generations and the inspiration that provides,” Walker said. “And so its like cutting off an appendage or something, were losing part of ourselves. So its really a kind of imperative for us to take action and try to protect the night sky.”\nWhat some may not realize when viewing paintings like “The Starry Night” or “The Night Cafe” is that during Van Gogh’s time the Milky Way really could be seen from the city streets at night. This is how it was for most of human history; change came with the explosion of electric lighting in the 20th century.\nHowever, light pollution is a serious threat beyond cultural heritage. It disrupts our sleep cycles and circadian rhythms, which can put individuals at greater risk of developing a number of cancers, according to researchers at Harvard University.\nSleep deprivation also interferes with people’s work and social lives and puts individuals at increased risk for many illnesses including heart disease, kidney disease, high blood pressure, obesity and depression to name a few.\nMillions of Americans are missing out on much-needed sleep. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimate that at least one in three Americans does not get enough sleep.\nFor animals, the consequences of light pollution can be even more dire.\nMany animals have evolved to use the moon and stars to guide their way in the night. Sea turtle hatchlings use the moonlight to find their way to the ocean, but in light-polluted areas, the newborns become disoriented and may actually crawl inland. The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission estimates that light pollution results in thousands of sea turtle deaths every year.\nMany communities in the southeastern United States, from Florida to the Carolinas, have ordinances requiring people living on the coast to turn off lights during sea turtle nesting season.\nLight pollution is also a likely culprit in what some scientists have called the “Insect Apocalypse.”\nIn recent years, global insect populations have plummeted, with as many as 40% of all species around the globe experiencing declines. For example, species that rely on bioluminescence, like fireflies, are unable to find mates among all of the competing lights.\nOther species that rely on the moon and stars for guidance, like moths, can spend the entire night in disoriented wandering. Some species mistake light bouncing off pavement for the surface of a body of water and mistakenly lay their eggs in the street.\nOne of the challenges to assessing light pollution’s growth is that it doesn’t show up well in satellite data.\nIt is difficult to do longitudinal studies because of the dramatic changes in satellite imaging quality over the years. Even the modern sensors are largely unable to pick up the blue light that is the most biologically disruptive component of light pollution.\nThis is why NOIRLab created the Globe at Night Program, which collects light data from ordinary people around the world. Participants rate their ability to see stars in the sky from wherever they find themselves.\nOver 277,000 measurements have been submitted since the program began collecting data in 2006. The submissions have been compiled into interactive maps and datasets available to the public that give a better snapshot of light pollution than standard satellite imagery.\nReducing light pollution is far from a Herculean task, according to Jim Dougherty, an environmental attorney and president of the International Dark-Sky Association’s D.C. Chapter. One easy fix is making sure that lights are properly covered so that the light is aimed down and not shooting off towards the night sky.\n“Here in D.C., the light fixture that we love to hate is the globe, which sends maybe 70% of its light straight up into the sky and serves no purpose whatsoever,” Dougherty told CNS. “That’s what we do in our homes, right? We don’t have bare light bulbs over the dining room table, we have lamps shades and covers.”\nAlongside better covered lights, the IDA advocates for dimmer and warmer lights overall. While some cities such as Pittsburgh have moved towards dimmer lights, Baltimore has been growing brighter with an increased number of electronic billboards.\nIn Washington last month, the Smithsonian Institution’s National Museum of Natural History launched an exhibit titled “Lights Out: Recovering Our Night Sky.” The temporary exhibit features over 100 photographs, 250 objects and interactive experiences underscoring the importance of nighttime darkness.\nFor many people, brighter streets are associated with safety and crime prevention.\n“That’s a common reaction. And there’s very little truth to it,” Dougherty said. In fact, studies have shown that brighter streets have little impact on crime. One study out of Chicago actually found that increasing the brightness of alleyways corresponded with a significant increase in crime."

    "title": "Maryland’s Cardin, other Democrats, push to include dental coverage under Medicare",
    "content": "WASHINGTON – Led by Maryland Sen. Ben Cardin, Senate Democrats are renewing a push to include dental care benefits under Medicare.\n“Oral health is integral to overall health and well-being,” Cardin said Wednesday at the year’s first hearing of the Senate Finance Committee’s health care subcommittee, which he chairs. “It can make worse an underlying health condition, impacting overall healthcare costs. It can impact a person’s ability to get a job and be well enough to work. It impacts a person’s ability to go to school, impacting the local and national economy.”\n“It seems to me the solution is clear,” said Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Massachusetts. “It’s time to expand Medicare to cover dental care.”\nMedicare currently does not cover dental costs in most cases. As of 2019, nearly half of Medicare beneficiaries, or 24 million people, did not have dental coverage, according to a study by the Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF). The average out-of-pocket spending for those with Medicare coverage was $874 in 2018.\nMedicaid beneficiaries have optional and limited services for dental care.\nEarlier this month, Cardin and Sen. Bob Casey, D-Pennsylvania, introduced legislation that would allow Medicare to cover dental, vision and hearing services, and increase the federal investment in Medicaid covering these services.\nCardin has been an outspoken proponent of accessible dental health coverage, often referring to the case of Deamonte Driver, a 12-year-old from Maryland whose difficulty receiving Medicaid eligibility prevented him from getting the proper dental care that would have saved his life.\n“What would have initially cost $80 for a tooth extraction, ended up costing hundreds of thousands of dollars, and, tragically, Deamonte Driver lost his life,” Cardin said. “So, that really struck home. A person in my community, that I represented, that we could have that kind of outcome.”\nIn February, Cardin, Sen. Debbie Stabenow, D-Michigan, and Rep. Nanette Barragán, D-California, reintroduced legislation that would significantly expand dental insurance coverage available to children nationwide through the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP).\nAs of Jan. 1, Maryland’s adult Medicaid beneficiaries became eligible for dental coverage, including regular checkups as well as emergency procedures under the Maryland Healthy Smiles Dental Program.\nIn 2019, two states had no dental coverage under Medicaid, 15 had “limited” coverage, and 13 had only emergency coverage, according to a study by the Center for Health Care Strategies.\nThe American Dental Association estimated $4 million in savings per year to Maryland’s Medicaid budget by expanding dental coverage to adults.\nEmergency visits for dental problems that could have been avoided by regular check-ups cost taxpayers, hospitals, and the government, according to research by the American Dental Association.\n“There are more than 2 million emergency hospital room visits in America for oral health conditions,” Marko Vujicic, chief economist and vice president of the Health Policy Institute at the American Dental Association, said at the Senate hearing. “If you do the math, that’s about one every 15 seconds. This is heartbreaking, but as an economist, I also want to highlight that this costs our healthcare system upwards of over $2 billion per year.”\nOther witnesses named workforce diversity and size, geography, and education as barriers to dental care across the United States.\n“It is well established that a person’s healthcare and trust in the medical community improve when they are seen by a provider of their own choice,” said Cherae Farmer-Dixon, dean of the Meharry Medical College School of Dentistry in Nashville.\nOnly 4% of dentists are Black, according to data from the American Dental Association.\nFarmer-Dixon pleaded with Congress to find a solution to the limited diversity in dentistry, stating that the job of educating a diverse workforce should not lie solely in the hands of the Meharry School and Howard University in Washington, both HBCUs."

    "title": "Wider access to overdose-reversing drug could ease deadly toll of opioid crisis, experts say",
    "content": "WASHINGTON – Wednesday’s Food and Drug Administration authorization of a life-saving drug that reverses overdoses could reduce the deadly impact of the ongoing opioid epidemic in Maryland and dozens of other states, according to health experts.\nAn FDA panel last month approved over-the-counter use of the nasal spray naloxone – commercially branded as Narcan – and it could be available at stores and online retailers by late summer.\n“Having these types of treatments is important for people that are not able or ready to stop using drugs,” Eric Weintraub, who heads the addiction research and treatment division at the University of Maryland School of Medicine, told Capital News Service. “Its basically keeping people alive.”\nOver-the-counter access to Narcan will help Marylanders who face a drug supply that is increasingly dangerous and lethal, Weintraub said.\nFentanyl was involved in 81.4 percent of all fatal overdoses in Maryland from November 2021 to November 2022, according to the state’s Opioid Operational Command Center.\nThe national number of deaths involving synthetic opioids – primarily fentanyl – has also been rising, with opioid overdoses claiming more than 70,000 lives nationwide in 2021. That death toll has increased 97-fold since 1999, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.\nBefore the FDA approval, some state laws and standing orders allowed people to get naloxone without a prescription at a pharmacy. Various advocacy groups and government agencies have also distributed the spray for free in dozens of states.\nWednesday’s decision addresses the “dire public health need” of the opioid epidemic and improves access to life-saving treatment, FDA Commissioner Dr. Robert Califf said in a statement.\nNaloxone’s approval is the latest initiative that Maryland health officials say could help curb the state’s opioid crisis.\nMultiple bills in the Maryland General Assembly this legislative session look to improve fentanyl testing and increase penalties for distributing fentanyl-like substances. Manufacturing, selling, or distributing fentanyl in the state currently carries a $20,000 fine and 20 years of prison.\nMaryland has “always been a leader” in helping people struggling with substance use disorders, Weintraub said.\nBut he added that naloxone’s approval sends a loud message supporting harm reduction strategies, which look to meet people who use drugs “where theyre at” when mitigating overdoses, according to the National Harm Reduction Coalition.\nSince 2017, Maryland residents have been able to get naloxone without an additional prescription from pharmacies.\nBut overdose response programs, which often distribute the life-saving drug for free, need a sign-off from a medical prescriber or must provide training before administering naloxone, according to Zach Kosinski, a harm reduction director with the Behavioral Health System Baltimore.\nOffering over-the-counter treatment could “change the game” for how response programs provide access to naloxone in Maryland, Kosinski added.\nThe Maryland Department of Health will share additional information about the availability of over-the-counter naloxone in Maryland as more details are finalized, according to Michael Coury, a spokesperson for the Opioid Operational Command Center.\nImproved naloxone access could also help reduce stigma around substance use disorders in the state, Kosinski said. A person may be more willing to get naloxone at a grocery store or gas station than through an overdose response program because it affords them more privacy, he added.\n“On the flip side, theres no requirement that places that now will legally be able to sell it over the counter actually will, so stigma could also contribute to retailers not carrying it,” Kosinski said. “People who use drugs are already shopping at all of these establishments in every way that anyone whos not using drugs is, and all this would do is make those stores a safer place.”\nIn a statement Wednesday, Robert Kramer, the CEO of the Gaithersburg-based company that manufactures Narcan, Emergent BioSolutions, also emphasized the need for community collaboration in setting up widespread naloxone access.\n“With leaders across government, retail and advocacy groups, we must work together to continue increasing access and availability, as well as educate the public on the risks of opioid overdoses,” Kramer said."

    "title": "New House caucus pushes for ratification of Equal Rights Amendment",
    "content": "WASHINGTON —Democratic Reps. Cori Bush of Missouri and Ayanna Presley of Massachusetts unveiled a new congressional caucus Tuesday with the goal of establishing the Equal Rights Amendment as the 28th Amendment to the United States Constitution.\n“Were here because from the start, people like me and many of my constituents were intentionally written out of our nations founding document,” Bush told a crowd outside the United States Capitol. “That ain’t right! The absence of foundational equality allows discrimination to persist and injustice to fester.”\nBush and Presley were joined by six other Democratic House members in launching the new Equal Rights Amendment Caucus: Sheila Jackson Lee of Texas, Jennifer McClellan of Virginia, Judy Chu, and Sydney Kamlager-Dove, both of California, Delia Ramirez of Illinois, and Madeleine Dean of Pennsylvania, as well as women’s rights activists, including ERA Coalition President and CEO Zakiya Thomas.\n“Weve had so many supporters and champions of the Equal Rights Amendment in Congress in both houses and this is the first time we actually have a caucus dedicated to the Equal Rights Amendment,” Thomas told Capital News Service. “We know that this is the time, the time is now. We’ve never been closer in the 100 years this movement has been going on. And so were excited about the energy, the enthusiasm that these congresswomen bring, but also the movement across the board. We have overwhelming public support, support in both houses of Congress. Now we just need to get the ERA added to the Constitution.”\nMaryland Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin will also serve as a vice chairman of the new caucus, although he was not present at Tuesday’s event.\n“Our new ERA Caucus proves that momentum for an Equal Rights Amendment is building as more and more Americans recognize the vital importance of writing gender equality into our Constitution,” Raskin said in a statement to CNS. “I’m proud to be a founding vice chair of this new — and urgently needed — ERA Caucus, and thankful to Reps. Bush and Pressley for leading us in the fight for women’s rights and against gender discrimination.”\nThe movement to enshrine the Equal Rights Amendment as the 28th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution was dealt a blow in February when the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia ruled that the original 1979 deadline and subsequent extension to 1982 for ratification of the amendment were binding.\nThe number of states needed to ratify the amendment — 38 — was not reached until 2020, long after the congressionally-mandated deadline. After Virginia became the 38th state to ratify the amendment, an ultimately unsuccessful legal battle began to compel the Archivist of the United States to publish the amendment.\nUndaunted, activists are now turning their focus to Congress.\nWhen asked about the impact of the D.C. Court of Appeals’ ruling, Thomas told CNS: “So if you read the court decision, what they actually say is, ‘Congress its now up to you to make the choice to do the thing that you need to to get the Equal Rights Amendment over the finish line.’ So for me that just gives more credence and power to what were doing here today and the efforts that are going on in Congress to get the Equal Rights Amendment published.”\nDean noted that the first iteration of the Equal Rights Amendment was introduced 100 years ago in 1923.\n“Here we are a century later and we still havent gotten it done,” she said. “I now have three granddaughters, so that century is weighing on me heavily. How is it we have not protected the rights of all women, all girls in this country regardless of race or creed or color?”"

    "title": "Maryland’s Moore seeks disaster aid for Chesapeake Bay invasive fish",
    "content": "WASHINGTON – Maryland Gov. Wes Moore has asked the federal government to declare the increasing population of invasive fish species in the Chesapeake Bay an ongoing commercial fishery disaster.\n“In recent years, the state has become increasingly concerned about the explosion in the abundance of invasive fish species in the Chesapeake Bay, including blue catfish, flathead catfish, and snakehead,” Moore said in a statement on Thursday. “It is critical to act now to mitigate the effects of these invasive species and to provide assistance to the commercial fishing industry.”\nIn a letter to Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo, the governor said “blue catfish are a particular concern.”\n“They are voracious eaters,” Moore wrote. “They consume other fish, crustaceans, and even other catfish. They out-compete the native species for both habitats and food and threaten key commercial fisheries including blue crab, striped bass, white perch, yellow perch, and American eel.” \nFor the fourth consecutive year, the Maryland Department of Natural Resources found in its 2022 annual survey that the native juvenile striped bass population in the Chesapeake Bay was below average. \nSince 2012, the total catch of seven of Maryland’s commercial fishery species that share their habitat with invasive fish has declined between 27% and 91%, according to data from the state.\nAlthough there is no direct scientific link between decreasing fish populations and the invasive species, the Maryland Department of Natural Resources still is concerned about the growing impact of these species. \nJoseph Love, manager for the Maryland Department of Resources Freshwater Fisheries Program, pointed to the relationship between predator and prey as a potential link to increasing blue catfish populations and decreasing native fish populations.\n“What we tend to do is point to the species that blue catfish eat, and highlight those prey as potentially impacted by the expansion of blue catfish,” Love told Capital News Service.\nIf the federal government were to declare this a disaster, Maryland would qualify for federal fishery disaster assistance. The request begins a formal review process by the Department of Commerce.\nUnder two federal statutes – the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act and the Interjurisdictional Fisheries Act – governors may request federal assistance if a natural or manmade disaster decreases fish populations, resulting in economic losses.\nThe decline of native fish species and the increase of invasive species has had detrimental effects on the state’s commercial fisheries, furthermore impacting the state’s economy. \nCommercial fisheries — including hard blue crab, striped bass, yellow perch, and others — have brought in an average of $64 million yearly in dockside value since 2012. Declines in these species are a significant loss for Maryland’s commercial watermen and the state’s economy, according to data from the state.\nBlue and flathead catfish were first introduced in Virginia in the 1970s and 1980s to establish recreational fisheries. Since then, their numbers have grown out of control. Now, these invasive catfish can be found in nearly every Chesapeake Bay tributary, according to the Chesapeake Bay Foundation. \nAllison Colden, the Chesapeake Bay Foundation’s Maryland senior fisheries scientist, said that declaring the invasive fish species a disaster could also complement regulatory reforms up for debate in the 2023 Farm Bill. \nThe 2008 Farm Bill required that U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) inspectors examine the processing of catfish on-site before they go to the market. Catfish are the only fish inspected by the USDA, as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) handles food safety for all other fish species. \n“This regulatory requirement to have a USDA inspector makes it economically infeasible to process blue catfish,” Colden told CNS. “It also means that it’s more difficult, and hurts the price of the product as well.”\nA similar disaster request was made in 2009 by then-Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley to help revitalize the Chesapeake Bay’s blue crab population. \nThe state received $2.2 million in funding from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administrations National Marine Fisheries Service. If NOAA approves the latest request for a disaster declaration, Maryland hopes to receive similar funding that could potentially decrease invasive fish species populations. \nThe Maryland Department of Natural Resources has been working on potential solutions to decrease the abundance of blue catfish in the Chesapeake Bay, all of which could be expanded if Maryland received federal funding. \nOne possible approach is to incentivize watermen to catch blue catfish. Love said the Maryland Department of Natural Resources offered money to watermen to buy nets and traps. There has also been discussion of further action to create a stronger demand in the market for the abundant blue catfish.\n“If we can find additional uses for blue catfish within our society, then that helps to diversify the marketplace and gives watermen greater opportunity…to sell their product and thereby increase the price per pound that they get,” Love said.\nIn his letter to Raimondo, Moore acknowledged that “the science quantifying the impacts of invasive species on the Bay ecosystem and to our commercial fisheries is relatively new and it is also challenging.”\n“Not all relationships are perfectly clear and myriad factors drive changes in abundance, species composition and fishery dynamics,” the governor wrote. “However, the evidence continues to mount that invasive species are a major and growing threat to the health of Marylands environment and economy. The opportunity before us is to take action now BEFORE they become a truly unmanageable disaster.”"

    "title": "Van Hollen, activists push policy priorities for Black women",
    "content": "WASHINGTON – Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Maryland, on Thursday urged congressional action to protect voting rights and commended the participation of Black women in politics as he welcomed dozens of activists from the Black Womens Roundtable to Capitol Hill.\nMembers of the Black Women’s Roundtable, an empowerment program that works to mobilize Black participation in American democracy, gathered in Washington to advocate for criminal justice reform, voting rights protections and a slew of other national issues.\n“Black women have been at the forefront of the fight for justice and liberty since the earliest days of our country,” Van Hollen said at a press conference outside the United States Capitol. “When it comes to casting your votes and calling for change, you are the ones who have moved our country forward.”\nVan Hollen called on Congress to pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act, which would identify states with a history of voting discrimination and require them to obtain permission before changing their voting procedures.\nSo far this year, state legislatures have introduced 150 restrictive voting bills and 27 election interference bills, according to the Brennan Center for Justice at the New York University Law School. Since 2020, dozens of states have enacted laws that make it harder for voters of color to cast their ballots.\n“Every citizen should be able to have access to the ballot box without having to jump over a lot of hoops or standing in long, long lines specifically designed to get people to get tired of voting,” Van Hollen said.\nAdvocates from the group also called on Congress to take action on criminal justice reform.\nThrough her work as CEO of the Clean Slate Initiative, Sheena Meade has spent her time advocating for so-called “clean slate” laws, which can seal arrest records for people convicted of low-level, nonviolent drug offenses who complete their sentences. Nationwide, Black people comprise 62 percent of drug offenders admitted to state prisons, according to Human Rights Watch.\nDuring the press conference, Meade asked activists to raise their hands if they had a friend or family member in jail or with a criminal record. A flurry of hands shot up in the crowd at the press conference.\n“Were about civic engagement, bringing people to the table, bringing people to the voting booth. But what happens when they’re shut out? How do we ask them to show up for our community when they cant?” Meade said.\nRoughly 4.6 million Americans cannot vote because of felony disenfranchisement convictions, according to The Sentencing Project. One in 19 Black Americans is excluded from voting in some way.\nAdvocates emphasized how criminal justice issues facing Black people across America connect to injustices associated with over-policing in Black communities.\nCriminal justice reform is of paramount importance to the lives of Black Americans, said Melanie Campbell, the president of the National Coalition on Black Civic Participation and convener of the Black Women’s Roundtable.\n“We have been brutalized by the criminal justice system. We have been the victims of poor policing. Weve been victims of aggressive policing,” Campbell said.\nAfter Minneapolis police murdered George Floyd in 2020, advocates hoped Congress would take swift action to improve the nations policing. But the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act – a law that aimed to prevent and remedy racial profiling by law enforcement across the country – stalled in 2021.\nWhile acknowledging the progress made in Congress on other issues facing Black Americans, Van Hollen agreed with advocates that lawmakers must prioritize passage of the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act.\n“We need to make sure that we have criminal justice reform and end the national scandal of mass incarceration in the United States of America and have constitutional policing,” Van Hollen said. “We have a lot of work to do.”"

    "title": "D.C. Guardian Angels return to the city to patrol Metro following increase in crime",
    "content": "WASHINGTON – The D.C. Guardian Angels, unarmed volunteer safety patrols dedicated to helping prevent crime in public spaces, are making their return to the Washington area’s Metro system after an increase in reported crimes.\nThe group is led by John Ayala, who started the Washington chapter in 1989 after previously being a member of the New York City group.\nThe Guardian Angels are a New York City-based nonprofit, started in 1979 by Curtis Sliwa. Since then, thousands of volunteers have joined the organization in cities across the country and around the world.\nAyala moved to Washington from New York City when he was 19 to bring the Guardian Angels to the nation’s capital. During the 1990s, both the New York and Washington groups were focused on the “crack cocaine era,” Ayala said.\n“We were involved with the open-air drug market, trying to get a hold on it.

Today, the group is working on trying to keep the Metro safe while recruiting new members with a goal of returning to a core of about 100 people. There are currently 40 members signed up, averaging around 40 years old.\n“Now it’s going to get to the point…where history is starting to repeat itself.

After hearing about the increased police presence, the Guardian Angels are focusing on what is happening on the trains, while also monitoring the station platforms.\n!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r=0;r\n“We're tired of hearing everybody blaming the mayor, blaming the police chief, blaming the councilman,” Ayala said. “Those people are not the ones out...robbing people, they’re not telling people to rob people.

He heard of the Guardian Angels recently through social media and saw that they were looking for volunteers.\n“I've seen increasing reports of violence and harassment on the Metro, particularly against women, and I'm a pretty strong and tall guy, so I'd like to think I'd step in and stop some acts like that, but it's easy to vigilante yourself thinking about it in confrontational terms like that,” Dailey said.\nIn February, there were a total of 195 arrests at various Metro facilities, including buses, Metro rail and parking lots, compared to 121 arrests in February a year ago, according to data released by the Metro Transit Police Department.\nThe MTPD reported 569 total crimes in February, an increase of 125 percent over the previous February. Sixty-five percent of the reported crimes in February happened on the Metro rail system.\nOverall crime on Washington’s transit system decreased during 2020 and 2021, reflecting the height of the COVID pandemic. Over the past year, crime rates have started rising again.\nA Guardian Angels patrol usually lasts two-and-a-half hours and volunteers are asked to put in eight hours a month.\nThe D.C. Guardian Angels' goal is to have 100 volunteers by spring. Those interested in volunteering can contact the Guardian Angels at 202-359-0601."

    "content": "WASHINGTON – A group of Maryland lawmakers, including Democratic Sens. Ben Cardin and Chris Van Hollen, has urged the Federal Communications Commission to improve broadband mapping data accuracy for the state.\n“Guaranteeing all Americans access to affordable, reliable, high-speed internet is a shared goal, and we appreciate the FCC’s commitment to this endeavor,” the lawmakers said in a letter Tuesday to the FCC. “To that end, we urge your agency to update and improve its broadband mapping data based on the feedback from our state’s broadband office.”\nJoining Cardin and Van Hollen on the letter were Maryland Democratic Reps. Steny Hoyer, Dutch Ruppersberger, John Sarbanes, Kweisi Mfume, Jamie Raskin, David Trone and Glenn Ivey.\nThe FCC is developing a national broadband map, which the lawmakers called “a crucial tool for understanding the state of broadband access in the country.” Broadband most commonly refers to the accessibility of high-speed internet resources. \nThe recommendation by Maryland lawmakers to update the FCC’s national broadband map data is based on comments made by the Maryland Office of Statewide Broadband, which found approximately 3,800 addresses incorrectly identified as serviceable by internet service providers compared to the state’s information on unserved locations, according to the letter. \nAs required by the Broadband Deployment Accuracy and Technological Availability Act, the FCC’s broadband map will provide insight into which areas are better served with high-speed internet. \nThe national map also will be used to determine how much each state needs in federal funding to increase connectivity. \nFunding comes from the Broadband, Equity, Access, and Deployment program, which provides $42 billion to implement high-speed internet access and is part of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act signed into law in 2021 by President Joe Biden.\nMaryland will receive base funding of $100 million from BEAD, and the accuracy of FCC mapping will impact equitable broadband funding. \nFunding will go towards deploying high-speed internet networks, developing digital skills training programs, connecting with communities without access and improving digital inclusion, according to the lawmakers’ letter.\n“Inaccurate data will result in unfair funding allocations,” the lawmakers said. “As such, we ask the FCC to consider reviewing additional data from states through the end of March.” \nErrors observed by the OSB found that inaccurate mapping data primarily impacts households in Western Maryland and the state’s Eastern Shore.\n“For many, particularly in urban and suburban areas, the high cost of broadband has prevented them from acquiring the service,” the lawmakers said. “Families in rural areas … face greater distances to existing broadband infrastructure.”\nThe national broadband map lists Hughes Network, Viasat, T-Mobile, Verizon and Comcast as Marylands top five high-speed internet providers.\n“We look forward to working with (the FCC) to consider whether current data collection efforts are sufficient to address mapping issues and whether additional legislative action is needed to incorporate other variables into the FCC’s collection efforts,” the lawmakers said."

    "title": "Moore and lawmakers plead Maryland&#8217;s case for new FBI headquarters",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  After a final pitch meeting Wednesday with the General Services Administration to land the new FBI headquarters in Prince George’s County, Maryland Gov. Wes Moore and the state’s congressional delegation said they urged federal officials to equally weigh racial equity in making a final decision.\nThe GSA said it is willing to reassess the September criteria, Moore said in a press conference after the meeting.\n“All we’re asking was a fair and transparent process and one where a thumb is not being put on the scale to unfairly disadvantage a community that has already been historically disadvantaged,” the governor said. “And we know that with a fair process, Maryland will prevail.”\nThe GSA is believed to be nearing a final decision on locating the new FBI headquarters, ending a search that began 10 years ago. The choice, narrowed from 35 initial candidates, is down to three locations: Greenbelt and Landover in Prince George’s County and Springfield in Fairfax County, Virginia.\nPrince George’s County is the only majority-Black jurisdiction in the national capital region. Greenbelt and Landover are the only sites near a historically Black college and university, Bowie State University.\nThe FBI headquarters search was suspended during the Trump administration. Restarted by the Biden administration, the selection process criteria was revised last September to give more weight  counting as 35% of the decision  to locating the new facility close to the Justice Department (which is in central Washington) and the FBI’s training center in Quantico, Virginia.\nThe other factors in the relocation are transportation access (25%), development flexibility (15%), racial equity and sustainable citing (15%), and the cost to acquire and prepare the site (10%).\n“It showed a clear bias. It was not consistent with congressional intent. It questioned the integrity of the process,” Sen. Ben Cardin, D-Maryland, told reporters, referring to the criteria.\nInstead, Cardin said, the governor and a delegation of local and state officials and Democrats in Congress urged the GSA to weigh criteria equally, at 20 percent.\nThe change would increase the importance of the racial equity criteria, something that the Biden administration has emphasized. In 2021, President Joe Biden signed an executive order that prioritized advancing racial equity through federal agencies. Last month, Biden reaffirmed the administration’s support for racial equity in another executive order.\nPrince George’s County Executive Angela Alsobrooks said both counties deserve an equal opportunity for federal investment. According to U.S. Census Data, the median income in Fairfax County is $134,000, compared to Prince George’s County with a median income of $90,000.\nLocating the site in Maryland would save taxpayers $1 billion, Alsobrooks added.\nThe Marylanders also disagreed with GSA officials that cost should be given the least weight in a location decision.\n“GSA says that it wants to get value for the taxpayer. They say that is one of their very top priorities,” Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Maryland, said. “So how is weighing the cost of site preparation and getting everything going only weighted 10 percent?”\nMaryland Lt. Gov. Aruna Miller emphasized that the two Prince George’s County sites best meet the transportation accessibility criteria, including distance to commuter airports. The locations also provide access to Maryland universities, granting the FBI a pipeline for recruitment and for training a diverse workforce, she said.\nThe Greenbelt location is only 140 steps away from a Metro and MARC train station. The Landover site provides access to three Metro stations less than two-and-a-half miles away, Miller said.\nThe Purple Line, a light-rail system with stops in Maryland, will be operating by 2026 with a stop in Greenbelt.\n“Both Maryland sites are ready to go in every sense. Transportation is no exception,” Miller said.\nMoore said that the two Maryland sites in Greenbelt and Landover are more prepared for construction and will be built on two to four years sooner than at the Springfield location.\nHe pointed out that any decision to put the headquarters in Virginia would not be because Maryland lacked anything. He said that the changes made in September gave the Springfield location an advantage.\nDespite final meetings between Virginia, Maryland and the GSA, there is still no specific timeline on when the final location will be announced.\n“Where the Biden administration decides to put the new FBI headquarters will inform the mission, the growth and also the efficacy of the bureau. Not just for this year, but for years to come,” Moore said.\nMaryland Chamber of Commerce President and CEO Mary Kane issued a statement backing the Prince Georges County sites.\n“Maryland is a hub for cybersecurity, serving as the home of the National Security Agency and Cyber Command at Fort George G. Meade, and as a perfect location for the FBI’s Cybersecurity Center,” she said. “Our highly accessible transit and highway system, strong business community, well-equipped higher educational institutions and skilled workforce provide the accessibility, infrastructure, workforce and talent pool needed to support the FBI’s mission and cybersecurity center needs.”"

    "title": "Biden to veto bill blocking use of ESG in retirement plan investments",
    "content": "WASHINGTON – President Joe Biden is poised to veto legislation that would roll back an administration rule allowing retirement plan managers to incorporate environmental, social and governance factors into investment decisions.\nThe Senate passed the measure Wednesday. It passed the House on Tuesday.\nCritics of the Biden administration rule argued that ESG policies politicize investing and are a “woke” practice, even though such policies are now in wide use.\nThe Labor Department’s rule was introduced last year and implemented in early January. It reversed a Trump-era policy that discouraged investors from citing environmental and social factors in retirement investments.\nSen. Joe Manchin, D-West Virginia, who voted with Senate Republicans to roll back the rule, said in floor remarks that “(ESG) is just another example of how our administration prioritizes a liberal policy agenda over protecting and growing the retirement accounts of 150 million Americans that will be in jeopardy.”\nBefore the vote on Wednesday evening, many of Manchin’s Democratic colleagues disagreed.\n“Republicans would like us to believe that some bizarre, viral epidemic of wokeism has spread into America’s great financial companies, into the investment advisors, into the banks, into all kinds of fiduciaries, and that needs to be somehow excised,” Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, R-Rhode Island, said during Senate debate. “That is not what has happened.”\nESG in practice is also being fought in some states. Likely Republican presidential candidate and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and trustees of the State Board of Administration passed a resolution to eliminate “woke” ESG considerations from state pension investments last year.\nThe Senate voted 50-46 to pass the rollback resolution. In addition to Manchin, Senate Republicans had the support of Sen. Jon Tester, D-Montana. Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, I-Arizona, voted with the majority of Democrats, including Maryland Sens. Ben Cardin and Chris Van Hollen, opposing the rollback.\nBoth Manchin and Tester are up for re-election in 2024 and face potentially difficult battles in red states.\nWith three Senate Democrats absent – John Fetterman of Pennsylvania, Dianne Feinstein of California, and Jeff Merkley of Oregon – Republicans were able to squeak out a rare win in the Senate, which has a Democratic majority.\nThe House on Tuesday passed, on a 216-204 vote, a resolution to block the same ESG rule. A single Democrat voted with the GOP: Rep. Jared Golden of Maine.\nThe White House’s Office of Management and Budget said Monday in a statement of administration policy that Biden would veto the rollback. It would be the first veto of his administration.\n“The rule reflects what successful marketplace investors already know – there is an extensive body of evidence that environmental, social, and governance factors can have material impacts on certain markets, industries, and companies,” the OMB said. “Such factors also can be a deciding factor among investments that equally serve the financial interests of the plan over the appropriate time horizon and that put the interests of the plan participants and their beneficiaries first and the federal government should not restrict that choice for plan managers.”\nThe OMB emphasized that the administration’s rule “is not a mandate – it does not require any fiduciary to make investment decisions based solely on ESG factors.”\n“The rule simply makes sure that retirement plan fiduciaries must engage in a risk and return analysis of their investment decisions and recognizes that these factors can be relevant to that analysis,” the statement said.\nESG factors are used by some investors and shareholders to gauge a company’s values. These factors assess a company’s eco-friendly practices, labor laws and safety measures, and structure of the company. Ultimately, they can promote sustainability and provide insight into whether a company is equipped to tackle future challenges.\n“ESG is about looking at the biggest picture possible so that investors can make decisions that decrease risk, while increasing returns,” Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-New York, said during the Senate’s debate.\nA Harvard University study found that 81% of institutional investors in the United States plan to increase their allocations to ESG products over the next two years, almost on a par with Europe.\nEnvironmental and social factors are increasingly considered in investing due to the growing risk of climate change and its economic effects.\nIn fact, global ESG fund assets reached $2.5 trillion at the end of 2022, a nearly 12 percent jump from the third quarter, according to Morningstar.\nEven so, Sen. Mike Braun, R-Indiana, told fellow senators that “this rule now allows the criterion of using those ESG goals, which would be simplified as being able to push a certain ideology or a certain point of view, into how retirement earnings are invested.”\nThe Republicans are the ones injecting ideology into the debate over ESG, Sen. Brian Schatz, D-Hawaii, countered, pointing to efforts to fight climate change as one example.\n“It’s the latest step in a campaign to prevent American financial institutions from making money from the clean energy revolution, and it should offend anyone who supports free markets,” Schatz said."

    "title": "Unpredictable cherry blossom bloom underscores climate change concerns",
    "content": "WASHINGTON – After a mild winter in the Washington metro region triggered some local cherry blossom trees to bloom in early February, the National Park Service announced Wednesday that this spring’s peak bloom for the iconic trees will occur between March 23-25.\nThe announcement signals that warmer winter weather across the region may not significantly disrupt the typical bloom cycle for the cherry blossoms around the Tidal Basin, which usually peak around the last week of March or the first week of April each year.\nExperts determine the peak bloom for cherry blossoms each year by predicting when roughly 70 percent of the flowers will have puffy, white or pink flowers. This year, experts charged with predicting peak bloom have the lowest confidence in their accuracy in roughly a decade, NPS spokesperson Mike Litterst told Capital News Service.\n“Everything is all over the place this year. Were seeing things from the trees that we cant explain,” Litterst said. “I think the trees are as confused about the weather as we are.”\nThe fact that some cherry blossom trees across the region had flowers by Valentine’s Day this year, paired with the record-breaking temperatures last week that saw Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport reach a daily high temperature of 80 degrees, have triggered climate change concerns among some environmentalists.\nChanges in timing for events like the cherry blossom bloom have historically been some of the best indicators of how natural systems around the world respond to climate change, said Matt Fitzpatrick, an ecologist and professor at the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science.\n“A lot of these events are very tightly aligned with climate, especially temperature,” Fitzpatrick said. “In any one year we cant just say, ‘oh, its climate change,’ but these events have been trending earlier and earlier.”\nCherry blossom trees adjust their blooming process depending on the warmth present in the air throughout the late winter and early spring.\nThe regions mild winter this year made cherry blossoms unable to reach their winter dormancy and gave experts no starting point for how to predict peak bloom this year, Litterst said.\nOver the last 70 years, NPS has tracked a temperature increase of about 2.2 degrees on the Tidal Basin, which is ringed with cherry trees, Litterst said. That has corresponded to peak bloom dates moving up by about six days on average.\n\nThe cherry blossoms this year would have to reach their peak before mid-March to break a record. The earliest peak bloom in recent history occurred on March 15, 1990.\nCherry blossoms around the Tidal Basin are resilient and have become accustomed to unpredictable spring weather during their 112 years in Washington, Litterst said.\nBut when cherry blossoms have to adapt to extreme weather patterns in the region, it indicates more drastic environmental issues for other species grappling with the effects of climate change.\n“The players in these natural systems, some of them are resilient, some of them are not,” Fitzpatrick said. “As these systems keep getting pushed towards an edge, the question is, ‘when do we hit the cliff?’ Thats when things can start to unravel.”\nPollinators in the region are a key species that could be affected by unpredictable cherry blossom bloom patterns in the future.\nWhile cherry blossoms and other trees typically rely on temperature cues to determine when to bloom, pollinator emergence depends on other environmental factors, such as daylight duration.\n“Lets say we get to a point where the cherry trees bloom so early that the blossoms are out, but the bees arent here yet to do their part,” Litterst said. “The earlier blooming could have a detrimental effect on those interrelationships with other parts of the ecosystem.”\nIf cherry blossoms are in full bloom before pollinators arrive, there can be a “mismatch” in timing for these two organisms. That could leave pollinators without enough food, said David Hawthorne, an associate professor of entomology at the University of Maryland.\nSince Tidal Basin cherry blossoms are not native to the ecosystem, pollinators likely won’t suffer as much if the trees disappear, Hawthorne said.\nBut cherry blossoms are a high-profile example of what is happening in hundreds of natural systems across the region grappling with mild winter weather and the effects of climate change.\n“We should use these cherry blossoms as an example of important stuff thats happening in the wider world,” Hawthorne said. “We obviously care about them because theyre local and beautiful and do this thing every spring we celebrate. But theyre also telling us whats happening to other trees worldwide.”\n“Its signaling that something really dramatic is happening out there in the whole world, which means in many places, it is really impactful and could be quite bad,” he said."

    "title": "Federal government’s “waters” definition stirs homebuilders, farmers; awaits Supreme Court decision",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  Homebuilders and farmers remain frustrated with a years-long effort by the federal government to define what constitutes “waters” for regulatory purposes.\nLast December, the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of the Army  announced a new rule to clarify what constitutes “waters of the United States,” also known as WOTUS, under the Clean Water Act. The rule, which enforces wider federal protections for navigable waters, seas, interstate waters and upstream waters, like wetlands, takes effect on March 20.\nTo provide more clarity, the EPA and the Army decided that ditches, artificially irrigated areas, artificial lakes, ponds, reflecting or swimming pools, water-filled depressions and features with low-volume water flow, including gullies and small washes, would be exempted.\nThe federal government has tried for decades to clarify what waterways should be subject to regulations under the Clean Water Act.\nBut the latest effort has not resolved conflict over the rules and may be complicated by an upcoming decision by the Supreme Court.\n“I dont know where this is ever going to end,” Robert Percival, director of the environmental law program at the University of Maryland School of Law, said in an interview with Capital News Service. “It’s clear Congress is not going to act because of political divisions.”\nPercival said the rules have been in flux since a 2006 Supreme Court decision that upheld the Clean Water Act’s “significant nexus” rule, which essentially states that a body of water is subject to regulation if it has an impact on downstream navigable waters.\nPercival said that while the EPA has authority over the WOTUS, the farm bureaus have concerns over the agency’s rulings amid the looming Supreme Court decision.\nPercival explained that anything decided by Congress before the outcome of that pending Supreme Court decision would be challenged.\nIn that case, an Idaho couple, Michael and Chantell Sackett, were told by the EPA that the lot they were building their house on violated the Clean Water Act because their land contained wetlands considered “navigable waters.”\nThe Sacketts were told to restore the property to its natural state and in 2012, the Supreme Court allowed for litigation that led to the EPA removing its compliance order.\nNow, the court is deciding how to determine and test whether wetlands should be subject to the Clean Water Act. The justices are expected to rule sometime this spring.\nDuring oral arguments last October, several justices expressed concerns that the EPA’s definitions of wetlands remained vague and worried about penalizing property owners who did not understand the definitions.\nMuch discussion focused on what the federal government considered a property that was “adjacent” to navigable waters.\n“How does anyone know, any reasonable person know, within maybe several hundred square miles in a watershed that drains into a body of water that is a water of the United States, know whether or not their land is adjacent to?” Justice Neil Gorsuch asked Deputy Solicitor General Brian Fletcher.\n“The agencies have told me they do not draw bright-line rules,” Fletcher replied. “They do not think 300 feet is unreasonable for adjacency.”\n“So how about 3,000 feet? Could be?” Gorsuch asked.\n“I dont know the answer to that, Justice Gorsuch,” Fletcher said.\n“Could it be three miles?” Gorsuch pressed.\n“I dont think it could be three miles,” Fletcher answered.\n“Could it be two miles?” Gorsuch continued.\n“That, again, when we start to talk about miles, that sounds too far to be adjacent  to reasonably be proximate to,” Fletcher said.\n“One mile?” the justice tried.\n“Again  and I see where this is headed…,” Fletcher started, to laughter.\n“So, if the federal government doesnt know, how is a person subject to criminal time in federal prison supposed to know?” Gorsuch said.\nJustice Sonia Sotomayor told Fletcher: “As you can probably tell, some of my colleagues are dubious that this is precise enough definition, adjacency, to survive.”\nDamien Schiff, attorney for the couple, told the justices his clients shouldn’t have been subject to federal regulation at all.\n“Theres no surface connection from the Sacketts property to any plausible water,” Schiff said. “Mere geographic closeness cant justify the contratextual conclusion that a two-third-of-an-acre residential lot with a sewer hookup with an address and a mailbox is somehow considered a water of the United States.”\nRepublicans in the House have introduced a resolution of disapproval, sponsored by Reps. Sam Graves of Missouri and David Rouzer of North Carolina, to reverse the latest EPA waters rule.\n“As American families and businesses continue suffering under the economic crises caused by the disastrous Biden policies of the last two years, this Administration has inexplicably decided to move the country back toward the costly and burdensome WOTUS regulations of the past,” Graves, chairman of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, said in a statement.\nThe new rule “is both poor policy and badly timed,” Rouzer said in a statement.\nAlicia Huey, the chairman of the board of the National Association of Home Builders, said that the current definition of WOTUS adds to numerous other federal regulations already in place.\nHuey said developers may wait 14 months or longer because they need the federal government to send someone to test if their properties are covered by the waters rules.\n“If I have a drainage ditch that runs into a storm drain, that runs into a creek that runs into the waterworks property… in order for me to put a fence in, I would have to have someone from the government come in,” she explained. “That could add five thousand (dollars) to the cost of just a fence.”\nIn its Dec. 2022 rule, the EPA stated that homebuilders may contact local regulators to make judgments on their land under the Clean Water Act.\nHuey said that the Biden administration and Congress have failed to clarify the regulations.\n“If the Supreme Court comes up with a new interpretation, then it will generate more litigation,” Percival predicted.\nPat Wolff, senior director of national affairs at the Maryland Farm Bureau, said that farmers only desire certainty from the government. She added that the definition of the country’s bodies of water should be easy to understand so that farmers won’t rely on expensive consultants.\n“Under any circumstances, it doesnt make sense for the EPA to issue rules while the Supreme Court is waiting to release decisions,” Wolff said.\nAlmost all farms are in a watershed, she explained, and farmers have been hesitant to make changes to their land, as a wet spot may be connected to a national waterway.\nSince the EPA established pollution limits for the Chesapeake Bay in 2010, the Maryland Farm Bureau has worked with the Maryland Department of Agriculture to develop watershed implementation plans for agriculture.\nShe said farmers fear efforts to conduct their business and protect the Bay will be hampered by new regulations.\n“Its the flip-flopping back and forth between rules that has created uncertainty for farmers,” she said."

    "title": "Supreme Court ruling could impact 800,000 Maryland student loan borrowers",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  A ruling from the Supreme Court against the White House’s student debt relief program could impact more than 800,000 Maryland student loan borrowers who are currently eligible for relief according to data from the federal Department of Education.\nSo far, about 320,000 Maryland borrowers have had their loan forgiveness applications approved, according to the Education Department data. Maryland ranks second in the nation for average student loan debt burden, according to data from the Education Data Initiative, a nonprofit research group that examines data from the federal government.\nJustices heard oral arguments Tuesday in two cases, Biden v. Nebraska and Department of Education v. Brown, which both feature challenges to the Biden administration’s authority to forgive student loans under the 2003 HEROES Act.\nHowever, the lawsuits are rooted in contrasting arguments. The case brought by the states alleges the loan forgiveness program will negatively impact state revenue from loan servicing, while the individuals in the other case are actually seeking greater student debt relief.\nThe court’s conservatives repeatedly voiced concerns about whether the high cost of the program fit within the framework of the HEROES Act’s authorization for the secretary of education to “waive or modify” statutory or regulatory provisions. Chief Justice John Roberts and other conservatives repeatedly returned to questions of fairness.\n“What I think they argue that is missing is costs to other persons in terms of fairness,” said Justice Neil Gorsuch. “For example, people who have paid their loans, people who plan their lives around not seeking loans and people who are not eligible for loans in the first place, and half a trillion dollars is being diverted to one group of favored persons over others.”\nIt should be noted that half a trillion dollars is a slight exaggeration. The Department of Education estimates that the cost of the program would be $379 billion over the course of a decade. Both the Department of Justice and the court’s liberals contended that the economic cost of not forgiving the loans would be far more troubling.\nJustice Sonia Sotomayor underscored the concrete impact of this program to the 50 million borrowers struggling with student loan debt: “Many of them don’t have assets sufficient to bail them out after the pandemic. They don’t have friends or families or others who can help them make these payments after the pandemic. The evidence is clear that many of them will have to default. Their financial situation will be even worse because once you default, the hardship on you is exponentially greater. You can’t get credit. You’re going to pay higher prices for things. They are going to continue to suffer from the pandemic in a way the general population doesn’t.”\nMaryland Sen. Chris Van Hollen, a Democrat, echoed Sotomayor’s concerns, telling Capital News Service: “Hundreds of thousands of Marylanders are struggling under the weight of student loan debt. And it’s not just holding them back, it’s also weighing down our economy.”\n“President Biden’s targeted student debt relief plan provides an economic lifeline to Marylanders struggling to get by and achieve their full potential,” the senator said. “The Supreme Court can and should uphold this plan, and I will keep working to pass long-term solutions to make higher education more accessible and affordable for all.”\n\nThere were significant questions during oral arguments over whether the states and individuals even had the right to sue the Biden administration in the first place.\nIn Biden v. Nebraska, the justices grilled Nebraska Solicitor General James Campbell about whether Missouri had the right to sue on behalf of MOHELA —Missouri’s loan servicing authority— which is not a state agency, but a state-affiliated corporation like Amtrak. MOHELA has the right to sue and be sued, but chose not to involve itself with the state’s lawsuit and only cooperated with the Missouri government when compelled to under state sunshine laws.\nJustice Amy Coney Barrett joined the liberal justices in hammering this point: “Why didn’t the state just make MOHELA come then? If MOHELA is really an arm of the state and all of this would be a lot easier — I mean the Solicitor General conceded that if MOHELA was here, MOHELA would have standing. If MOHELA is an arm of the state, why didn’t you just strong-arm MOHELA and say you’ve got to pursue this suit?”\nThe legal concept of standing  meaning a litigant is affected by the issue and thus has a right to bring suit  is a major hurdle for the complainants in both suits. But, even if Barrett were to side with the liberals on standing, another conservative justice would still have to join them for Biden to prevail.\nFor many Marylanders, the outcome will have major financial impacts.\nDepartment of Education data reveals that so far about 40% of eligible Marylanders have had their loan forgiveness applications approved. That could all be canceled out if the court nixes Bidens program.\nThe average amount of debt in Maryland is $42,861 per borrower. That’s a steep sum for a state where the per capita income is just $45,915, according to the United States Census Bureau.\n“A higher education is not the only way to succeed in this country, but the long-term financial benefits are indisputable,” Maryland Sen. Ben Cardin, a Democrat, told CNS. “As states have cut back their proportion of funding for higher education, the cost has skyrocketed and the financial burdens of the pandemic dug a deeper hole for millions."

    "title": "Cardin part of bipartisan effort to designate Wagner Group as foreign terrorist organization",
    "content": "WASHINGTON — A group of senators has reintroduced legislation to designate the Russian paramilitary Wagner Group as a foreign terrorist organization. \nThe bipartisan group, which includes Sens. Ben Cardin, D-Maryland, and Roger Wicker, R-Mississippi, targets the Wagner Group through the Holding Accountable Russian Mercenaries (HARM) Act. \nThe bill would require Secretary of State Antony Blinken to designate the Wagner Group as a terror organization under section 219(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act. The proposal also includes measures that would apply to any organization that would either be an affiliate or a future successor of the Wagner Group.\n“Putin’s unprovoked and illegal war against Ukraine has been made more deadly because of the Wagner Group,” Cardin said in a statement. “These mercenaries have been credibly linked to countless atrocities in Ukraine as well as Syria and across the African continent. The U.S. must step up and immediately designate the Wagner Group as the terrorists they are. It is the best way to hold them and Russia accountable for their human rights violations.”\nSince the Russian invasion of Ukraine last February, the Wagner Group, a paramilitary organization of mercenaries, has operated as a private military for Russian President Vladimir Putin and has supplemented depleted Russian forces. \nCardin said the proposed measure aims to diminish the strength of Putin’s military forces. The war in Ukraine reached its one-year anniversary on Feb. 24.\nThe Wagner Group — which has run operations not only in Ukraine but in African countries such as Mali, Sudan, and the Central African Republic — has also delivered weapons to North Korea and engaged in multiple atrocities, including using nerve agents against members of the public, killing journalists and committing acts of sex trafficking, torture and rape.\nWhile the Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control recently labeled the Wagner Group as a transnational criminal organization, the newly reintroduced legislation would go a step further. \nDesignating the Wagner Group as a terrorist organization would not only continue to show the United States’ support of Ukraine, but it would also allow for stricter financial sanctions to be levied against the organization. \nThe Bureau of Counterterrorism at the State Department lists five main implications for designating a group as a terrorist organization: it supports efforts to curb terrorism financing and encourages other nations to follow suit; it internationally stigmatizes and isolates designated terrorist organizations; it deters donations or contributions and economic transactions; it heightens public awareness of terrorist organizations; and it signals to other governments the U.S. concern about named organizations.\n“We must hold the Wagner Group and any who support these terrorists accountable for the atrocities they have committed across the globe,” Wicker said in a statement.\nCardin and Wicker were joined on the legislation by Sens. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, Jeanne Shaheen, D-New Hampshire, Thom Tillis, R-North Carolina, Richard Blumenthal, D-Connecticut, Marco Rubio, R-Florida, and Sheldon Whitehouse, D-Rhode Island.\n“This is an important designation as it provides the United States even more tools to hold this organization accountable for their heinous behavior,” Graham said in a statement. \nThe reintroduction of this legislation also follows the European Parliament, which last November condemned the Wagner Group and declared Russia a state sponsor of terrorism."

    "title": "Maryland advocates push specialty crop support, conservation for 2023 farm bill",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  Maryland agriculture officials, conservation groups and producers from the state’s more than 12,000 farms are vying for their priorities to appear in this year’s federal farm bill.\nA behemoth package of legislation considered to be the primary vehicle for addressing agriculture issues and setting policy, the five-year farm bill expires in September.\nThe bill authorizes billions of dollars in a dozen areas ranging from crop price supports to forestry, with most funding set aside for nutrition programs. The measure’s three primary stakeholders are nutrition, farm and conservation groups.\nThis year, groups in Maryland will push to increase farm bill programs for smaller specialty farms – which produce crops like fruits, vegetables and tree nuts – and establish more incentives for farmers to embrace conservation practices.\nAgriculture is Maryland’s biggest industry, but the state’s farms occupy an average of 161 acres, according to the Maryland Department of Agriculture. That means most Maryland farms are considered small or medium within farm bill programs, which disproportionately subsidize large farms growing commodity crops like corn, wheat and soybeans.\n“The pie always gets sliced too small for farms like us, and the pie is sliced much bigger to the really corporate, big industrial farms,” said David Paulk, an organic vegetable farmer who sells at Sassafras Creek Farm in Leonardtown, Maryland. “That’s where the farm bill needs to be opened up and restructured to be more inclusive.”\nCrop insurance – purchased by farmers to protect against the loss of their crops or falling prices – is among the most important provisions of the farm bill, with roughly $90 billion authorized in 2018. But insurance protection remains out of reach for most Maryland specialty crop farmers.\n“Crop insurance has worked very well for the major row crop industry, but its been lacking when it comes to specialty crops. Crop insurance isnt available or the cost of the insurance isnt in line with the coverage provided,” said Patt Wolffe, senior national affairs director for the Maryland Farm Bureau.\nThe farm bill has slowly expanded the number of crops covered by crop insurance in the last few decades, said James MacDonald, a research professor at the University of Maryland agriculture school.\nThis year could be a tipping point for expanding this safety net beyond the largest agricultural commodities, MacDonald said.\nIncentivizing farm bill conservation programs is also a key priority this year as Maryland fights to preserve the Chesapeake Bay watershed.\nRoughly 90 percent of remaining reductions in Chesapeake Bay pollution need to come from state agricultural sectors, said Beth McGee, the science and agricultural policy director at the Chesapeake Bay Foundation.\nMaryland is already a national leader in climate-friendly farm practices. The state has heavily promoted sustainable agriculture and boasts one of the highest rates of cover cropping, plants grown primarily to benefit the successful growth of other future crops by preventing soil erosion and controlling pests and weeds. But conservationists like McGee hope to see incentives in this farm bill for greater crop diversity in the state.\n“From the global perspective, the current programs are subsidizing a food system that isnt sustainable. And we need to start making incentives for smaller farms that want to diversify, McGee said.\nThe pandemic exposed the need for more diverse agricultural practices across the United States, said Marc Grossman with The Farm at Our House in Olney, Maryland. Provisions in the new farm bill should be more environmentally “targeted” and “resilient” because current regulation in the U.S. agricultural industry discourages farmers from implementing climate-resilient practices, he said.\nAgriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack hit on the same theme in a speech Thursday to the USDA’s Agricultural Outlook Forum.\n“We have an extraordinary opportunity with the farm bill reauthorization to say to the farming community: ‘It’s not just get big, it’s diversify. It’s create multiple profit centers in your farming operation,’” Vilsack said, according to The Fence Post, an agriculture newspaper.\nBut for farmer Jason Scott, everything must come with flexibility. Some USDA conservation programs require farmers to sign up for the entire, five-year farm bill authorization period, which causes them to be risky due to environmental changes.\n“My system and my fields in my farms are a lot different than my neighbors and much more different than farmers in Kansas and Washington state,” the Dorchester County grain producer said. “Because were dealing with Mother Nature, I think its important to keep all these things voluntary.”\nFarmers across the state have utilized the Maryland Department of Agriculture’s more flexible conservation programs as a substitute for many farm bill conservation programs. But with the bold policies necessary for states to reverse climate change, the farm bill must incentivize wide-reaching farm conservation practices, Wolffe said.\n“Farmers want to be part of the solution. We just need incentives to make that possible because everything has a cost. And if that cost doesnt increase your farm profit, then farmers need help to implement it,” Wolffe said.\nMost farm bill programs will run through the end of the federal fiscal year on Sept. 30. Some were also extended as part of last year’s Inflation Reduction Act, which allocated more than $40 billion to many programs traditionally authorized by the farm bill.\nWith a looming deadline, a divided Congress and dozens of converging wishlists, the biggest challenge in passing this year’s farm bill is avoiding a split of the coalition of farmers, nutritionists and conservationists.\nMany Republicans have proposed spending cuts to nutrition programs, while the Inflation Reduction Act has funneled an unprecedented amount of money into conservation programs.\nIf either party makes too many cuts or compromises, it could split the coalition and leave millions of farmers in financial peril.\n“The big political battle this year is whether they can form an agreement in a timely enough fashion to put a bill together with support from the whole coalition, and they need the coalition to get it passed through Congress,” MacDonald said.\nBoth the Senate Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee and the House Agriculture Committee already have begun hearings and held listening sessions as lawmakers and staff craft the new farm bill."

    "title": "Supreme Court justices skeptical of challenges to tech giant immunity",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  — The Supreme Court heard arguments this week in two cases that could reshape the internet as we know it. \nGonzalez v. Google and Twitter v. Taamneh both challenge Section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act, which shields internet service providers from liability over hosted content. Both suits were brought by the families of terrorist attack victims who allege online platform algorithms promoted radicalizing content.\nThough rulings in either cases could have dramatic repercussions for tech companies, the justices seemed wary of making waves and there was little noticeable daylight between the court’s ideological wings.\nCaitlin Chin, a fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), broke down the law in an interview with Capital News Service:\n“Section 230 is a legal provision that essentially says two things: First, that online platforms should not be treated as the publishers of content that is created by third parties. In other words, if platforms like social media or restaurant review sites or e-commerce platforms decide to allow user-generated content or third party content, they should not be sued or liable for that content in most, but not all, cases. And second, Section 230 also says that if platforms make good faith efforts to remove or moderate content on their website, they shouldnt be held liable for that either.”\nThe issue considered in Twitter v. Taamneh is whether a company that provides widely accessible services can be considered to provide substantial assistance to terrorists using the platform under the federal Anti-Terrorism Act.\nThe families of five victims of terrorist attacks perpetrated by ISIS sued under the ATA, claiming that the companies allowed the terror organization to use their platforms to recruit, plan and fundraise for the attacks. \nIn a related case, Gonzalez v. Google, the family of a U.S. citizen killed in a terror attack while studying in Paris, claimed that YouTube’s algorithm targeted and recommended videos to its users, thus supporting ISIS. \nDespite the order in which they were argued, the Gonzalez case can only proceed if the justices rule in favor of Taamneh et al. in the Twitter case. \nAt multiple times during Tuesday’s arguments, the justices suggested that perhaps Section 230 issues would be better resolved across the street at the Capitol. \nThere was much hand-wringing  at the court about making a blanket solution to a complex problem. As Justice Elena Kagan quipped, “We really dont know about these things. You know, these are not like the nine greatest experts on the Internet.”\nOn the first day of proceedings — Google v. Gonzalez — justices seemed to question attorney Eric Schnapper, who was representing the Gonzalez family. Justice Clarence Thomas asked what the difference was between an algorithm that recommends cooking videos and one that suggests ISIS content, which Schnapper had trouble answering. \nThe question illustrated a point made later by Kagan, who said that it was difficult to draw a line between recommendations of neutral algorithms, which suggests content with minimal input from its owners.\nIn the Taamneh case, Kagan compared Twitter’s role to that of a bank: “Yeah, the same thing could have been said of banking. It was, you know, we just provided the same banking services to the terrorists as we did to everybody else. But in fact that — the provision of that service materially supported, and the bank knew that it was going to materially support, terrorist services.”\nOn the other hand, Justice Samuel Alito was far more skeptical that Twitter’s general services constituted aiding and abetting, comparing it to the liability a telephone company would have if terrorists used their phones. \nAttorney Lisa Blatt, who represented Google, juxtaposed what some perceive as the two extremes presented by Section 230: an internet where everything is subject to challenge and only uncontroversial, sunshiney things pass through and an anarchic place where almost everything is allowed.\n“You have the Truman Show versus a horror show,” Blatt said. “You have only anodyne, you know, cartoon-like stuff thats very happy talk, and otherwise you just have garbage on the Internet.”\nThere is a middle ground between those two extremes, though it most likely would require legislative action, rather than a decisive ruling in either case. Congress has already made carve-outs from Section  230 for sex trafficking and copyright violations. \nCongress could make additional exceptions for hate speech and violence, according to Chin. \nOther proposals include allowing internet platforms to be sued, but for highly limited damages. An individual harmed by something posted online could sue for injunctive relief or attorneys fees, but not for large sums of money. \nAlternatively, Congress could take a consumer protection approach, making internet service providers subject to terms of service agreements and bringing them under the jurisdiction of a federal regulatory agency like the Federal Trade Commission. \n“The way I personally stand is, yes, I can see why Section 230 helps a lot of businesses, especially smaller businesses,” said Chin. “If I were to run a tech startup with one or two people, it would be super, super difficult for any startup to get off your feet, if theyre facing millions of lawsuits over content that other people post on their websites. So I can understand why Section 230 can be beneficial.”\n“But at the same time, as weve seen in the past, Section 230 has provided incentives for tech platforms to essentially not moderate very, very harmful content,” she said. “And I think the two terrorist attacks highlighted in these cases demonstrate that. Tech platform tech platforms need responsibilities. I do think that theres a middle ground between either no liability or 100% liability.”\nThe Biden administration has called for Congress to revoke Section 230’s liability shield and bring tech companies under tighter regulation. \nHowever, the administration is walking a narrow line on the issue. The Department of Justice argued against the tech companies in Gonzalez vs. Google, but joined Twitter in the second case. \nThe administration is balancing its interests. The government wants to limit Section 230 immunity, but is hesitant to expand the scope of the ATA. \nDeputy Solicitor General Edwin Kneedler said Wednesday: “The United States condemns in the strongest terms the terrorist act that caused Mr. Alassaf’s death and sympathizes with the profound loss that the plaintiffs in this case have experienced.”\n“We submit, however, that the allegations in this complaint do not state a claim that the defendants aided and abetted, that is, that they assumed a culpable role in that murder.”"

    "title": "New calls by Biden, Democrats for assault weapons ban face familiar foe: most of GOP",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  Despite renewed calls for an assault weapons ban following a string of mass shootings, prospects for passage of any new gun safety legislation in a divided Congress are poor.\n“There’s very little chance of any movement in the House. I don’t want to say never, because you never say never,” Tanya Schardt, senior counsel and director of state and federal policy at the Brady Campaign, told Capital News Service.\nSen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, who was involved in a bipartisan gun safety bill that became law last year, saw no appetite among GOP lawmakers to do more.\n“I’d be surprised if the House would be willing to take something up,” Cornyn said on NBC last month after two mass shootings in California.\nGun violence is an epidemic in the United States. And 63 percent of Americans are dissatisfied with the nation’s gun laws, according to a Gallup Poll released Wednesday. That is the highest level of public disapproval in the 23 years the poll has tracked the issue.\nThe Michigan State University shooting that killed three and injured five on Feb. 13 marked the 67th mass shooting since the start of 2023, reported the Gun Violence Archive, an independent data collection organization.\nThe shooting occurred less than a week after President Joe Biden’s State of the Union address in which he urged: “Ban assault weapons now. Ban them now. Once and for all.”\nThe differences among lawmakers were on display during the week of the speech: some Republicans wore assault rifle lapel pins; some Democrats wore lapel pins saying “March for Our Lives,” produced by a gun violence survivor group of the same name.\nDemocrats hold a slim majority in the Senate, while Republicans have a very narrow majority in the House. Most GOP lawmakers have opposed major gun safety bills. Any gun bill would have to get the nod from the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, who is a strong opponent of an assault weapons ban.\n“They’re coming for your guns,” Jordan declared during a House debate last year on an assault weapons ban measure.\nIn early February, House Natural Resources Committee Republicans defeated a push to explicitly ban firearms from the House floor.\n“I feel I need one everywhere here. There are often times we are harassed in the hallways. We walk alone,” said Rep. Lauren Boebert, R-Colorado, during the committee meeting.\nRep. Andrew S. Clyde, R-Georgia, handed out the assault weapons lapel pins. Clyde described his motives in a tweeted video on Feb. 2, the second day of National Gun Violence Survivors Week.\n“Well, I give it out to remind people of the Second Amendment of the Constitution and how important it is in preserving our liberties,” Clyde said.\nNevertheless, Democratic lawmakers are pressing ahead with new gun safety legislation.\nIn late January, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-California, who, with then-Sen. Biden pushed for the assault weapon ban in 1994 that expired 10 years later, sponsored a new bill to restore the ban. Among the 41 co-sponsors of the new bill are Maryland Sens. Ben Cardin and Chris Van Hollen, both Democrats.\n“The anguish of families who have lost children to daily gun violence and mass shootings is indescribable. As a nation, as individuals, we cannot become numb to this pain. We must finally take meaningful action,” Cardin said in a statement.\n“Gun violence has traumatized our country for far too long Inaction is not an option, Van Hollen said in a statement. This necessary legislation will help keep weapons of war off our streets and put a stop to this senseless violence.”\nRep. David Cicilline, D-Rhode Island, introduced a companion version of the assault weapons ban in the House.\nOn Feb. 7, Cardin and Van Hollen joined 26 colleagues to re-introduce the Keep Americans Safe Act, a bill that would outlaw high-capacity magazines.\nTwenty-four senators, including Cardin and Van Hollen, have co-sponsored a separate measure raising the minimum age to purchase an assault weapon from 18 to 21.\nOn Feb. 1, the chairman of the House Gun Violence Prevention Task Force, Rep. Mike Thompson, D-California, and Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick, R-Pennsylvania, reintroduced the Bipartisan Background Checks Act. The bill, which would establish new background checks for firearm transfers between private parties, was initially passed in the House last session but not in the Senate.\nIf passed, all the bills would build on historic bipartisan gun control legislation signed into law by Biden last year.\nA rare moment of accord between the two parties on gun safety, the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act provides $750 million for states to enact “red flag laws” and invest in programs to expand mental health and support services in schools.\n“I am absolutely certain that the law that we passed last year, the first gun safety measure passed by Congress in 30 years, is as we speak saving lives,” Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Connecticut, said earlier this month on MSNBC.\nOn Tuesday, the Justice Department announced over $200 million to be sent out to help administer “red-flag laws” and other crisis-related services authorized by the act. Maryland will receive $5.12 million.\n“These are not extreme steps,” David Pucino, deputy chief counsel at Giffords Law Center, an organization advocating for an end to gun violence, told Capital News Service. “These are incremental, important, gun safety laws that respect the rights of law-abiding gun owners, but that simply will do important work to reduce gun violence in America to protect all people from gun violence.”"

    "title": "Meet the people fleeing the United States",
    "content": "WASHINGTON — At the foot of the Statue of Liberty in New York Harbor are the words “Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free,” inviting the oppressed and downtrodden from across the globe to America’s protective embrace. Yet since 2000, almost 14,000 Americans have applied for asylum in other countries.  \nThe dangers of life in America outweigh the benefits for some Americans, according to a new paper from Jayesh Rathod, a professor of law at American University’s Washington College of Law. This stands in stark contrast to America’s self-image as the land of the free. \n“As somebody who studies immigration law, part of the narrative that I impart to my students, and that those of us living in this country, and even abroad are aware of, is that the United States is portrayed as a destination country, the premiere destination country for immigrants,” Rathod told Capital News Service in an interview. “And in some ways what this trend is doing is pretty profoundly disrupting that narrative.”\nRathod’s paper primarily focuses on the rare phenomenon of American citizens seeking asylum in other countries because they feel unsafe in this country. Since 2000, just under 14,000 asylum applications have been made by United States citizens to other countries, with Canada being the top destination by far. \nRathod outlines various reasons why Americans may choose to take the leap. There are, of course, political dissidents  Edward Snowden and others who can become propaganda tools for governments at odds with the United States. There are domestic violence survivors, like Holly Ann Collins, who in the 1990s was granted asylum in the Netherlands after escaping an abusive husband in the United States. \nIn addition, many asylum applications are cases of families where the children are U.S. citizens by birth but the parents are immigrants to the United States who feared deportation and the separation of their families. This was especially prominent during the presidency of Donald Trump and the data reflects a large spike in asylum applications following his victory in 2016. \n\nThe grounds upon which a person can claim asylum are narrow. Criteria for who may claim asylum vary by country, but generally the United States is not considered dangerous enough to warrant asylum. \nThe United States makes for an interesting case because persecution does not exist equally across the country. Someone can move between states and find different levels of legal and social acceptance. Given the patchwork, most American asylum claims fail. \nWhen asked how often these claims succeed, Rathod said: “Not very often. So thats another finding is that of the 14,000 or so claims that were lodged by U.S. citizens from 2000-2021, fewer than 400 were granted. So what that tells us is that theres a general sense that the U.S. can still protect people.”\nOne group of emigres highlighted in Rashod’s paper are trans and queer people who no longer feel safe living in the United States. Researchers at UCLA’s Williams Institute found that transgender people are four times more likely to be the victims of violent crime than their cisgendered counterparts. \nNot only that, but violence against trans people has been on the rise in recent years. Both 2021 and 2022 were record-breaking years for violence against trans people. According to the Human Rights Campaign, there were at least 38 trans people killed by gun violence or other violent means. Most of this violence is perpetrated against Black and Latina transgender women. \nGiven the increased risk of violence in the United States, a life abroad has seemed appealing to some members of the trans community. \nIn deep red North Dakota, Zara Crystal and other activists are working to get trans people out of the country through the new non-profit TRANSport. The group started on Facebook and achieved 501(c)(3) nonprofit status in November. The organization will focus on moving trans people in difficult situations out of the country and to a safer locations of their choosing. \nBefore even attempting an asylum application, TRANSport will help make its clients have their passports, paperwork, money and medical needs in order for relocation. The organization is currently raising money and plans to begin accepting applications in March. \nCrystal herself hopes to eventually start a new life in Sweden, which a survey by UCLA’s Williams Institute ranked among the most supportive countries for transgender rights.\nSweden also is where transgender activist Danni Askini sought asylum in 2018. The 20-year-old grew up in a small, conservative North Dakota town with a conservative evangelical Christian family. In high school, she underwent four years of conversion therapy before running away to Fargo. \nWhile Fargo has been an improvement, Crystal said she still feels alienated: “I never felt at home in the United States. Ive always felt other. And it got to the point where so many people were sending me death threats and stuff. I just didnt feel safe here anymore.” \nShe told CNS the threats,  combined with concerns over proposed anti-LGBT legislation, spurred her to make solid plans to leave the States. \nThere are those who have already been able to establish new lives abroad, even without asylum, like Julia and Justine, a couple who moved to Berlin, Germany, during the Trump administration.  They asked that their last names remain confidential.\nJustine is a trans woman who originally fled violence and abuse in rural Arkansas before landing in the Washington, D.C., area. \nIn Washington, Justine met Julia and found work as a contractor with U.S .Citizenship and Immigration Services, an agency of the Department of Homeland Security, which is responsible for immigration and naturalization services. Justine had concerns about the Trump administration’s immigration policies, but an incident in 2018 served as the catalyst for her departure from the United States.\n\nJustine was leading a hackerspace in Washingtons Columbia Heights neighborhood when Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers conducted a raid in the neighborhood. Some of Justine’s students were undocumented and the raid served as her “road to Damascus” moment. She realized she needed to get out. Around the same time, she saw a job posting with a tech startup in Berlin. \nFor Justine, Berlin was the obvious choice: she had been there several times before and actually spent time living in Germany as a child when her father was in the military. When asked if she would ever come back to the United States, Justine expressed concerns about the state of American democracy and anti-LGBT laws, especially ones targetting teachers. \n“I think they have effectively made the practice of me just being myself and teaching people illegal,” Justine said. Recruiters have contacted her about job openings in places like Texas, but that’s off the table for Justine: “No, no, no, you cannot pay me enough to go to Texas.”\nJustine and Julia are active users on the subreddit /r/AmerExit. The page, which has over 30,000 members, is dedicated to Americans who no longer want to live in the United States. \nThere seems to be a large interest in life abroad among American citizens, even if asylum may not be on the table. A 2019 Gallup poll found that record numbers of Americans wanted to leave the country. The survey found that 40% of women under 30 would rather live in another country. Canada was the most desired destination. \nWhile the vast majority of Americans will not be permanently leaving their country,  Rathod said that it is an important question to ask why people feel that they need to not only leave their town or state but also the country as a whole. \n“The point is that people are feeling like, well, its just not worth it for me to live in this country,” Rathod said. “ Now, you know, so I think thats an important and really, for me, a very powerful message that we need to pay attention to.”"

    "title": "Maryland lawmakers aim to promote Black history education even as it is under attack in some states",
    "content": "WASHINGTON – While the teaching of Black history is under fire and facing censorship in some states like Florida, two Maryland lawmakers have proposed legislation aimed at providing more federal support to promote and preserve Black history, culture and education.\nRep. Kweisi Mfume and Sen. Ben Cardin, both Maryland Democrats, introduced their measures on Feb. 1, the first day of Black History Month.\nThe legislation would create a council of 12 presidential appointees to advise the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) on promoting Black voices, ensuring that Black history and culture is recognized in schools, providing resources to preserve Black history, and recommending national policies that would generate improved public understanding of African American history and culture.\n“African American history is American history,” Cardin said in a statement. “For too long our history lessons failed to fully acknowledge the role of Black Americans. And it happens in far more places than schools – so much of what we have learned for generations about history, music, culture and more has diminished the role of African American creators, writers, musicians and beyond.”\n“This bill pushes back against the attacks on African American history in our schools and communities,” Mfume said in a statement. “We must ensure that Black history is told fully and accurately in America. While the truth of our journey may not be the easiest to tell, it should be protected and celebrated because the story of African American people is intricate and integral to the story of the United States of America – that history must be treated and admired as such.”\nSchool courses on African American history are generating political controversy. A new Advanced Placement African American studies course, which is currently being piloted across the country, has come under fire recently.\nGov. Ron DeSantis, R-Florida, and the Florida Department of Education attacked some of the topics being covered in the course, including so-called critical race theory and the Black Lives Matter movement.\nThe AP course’s official framework has since been revised. Supporters of Black history education claim that texts by scholars focusing on critical race theory have been removed from the course and that essential topics were left out. According to a statement from the College Board, however, no such changes were made.\n“We must also clarify that no Black scholars or authors have been removed from the course. In fact, contemporary scholars and authors are never mandated in any AP framework,” the College Board said in a Feb. 8 letter to the Florida Department of Education.\nThe College Board also wrote that no topics were removed because “they lacked educational value.”\nIn an updated statement on Feb. 11, the College Board said it should have been more clear about the framework and topics of the course, differentiated between the final curriculum and the early framework, and denounced the Florida Department of Education’s “slander” of the course.\nThe course is being piloted in Maryland at the Baltimore Polytechnic Institute, part of Baltimore City Public Schools, and is one of only 60 schools in the country participating in the pilot program during the 2022-2023 school year.\nIn a Feb. 1 tweet, Cardin wrote that he was proud that the course is being piloted in Baltimore.\n“Any kind of censoring or shielding students from #BlackHistory is a disservice to our nation  the people who came before us. Black History IS this nations history,” the senator said.\nAs of December, 31 students were enrolled in the AP course, according to Dennis Jutras, coordinator of Gifted and Advanced Learning at Baltimore City Public Schools. The district has not received any direct responses from students or families regarding the course, which “is typically the case when things are going well,” he said.\n“The problem is that traditional history classes do not give equal bandwidth to all voices,” added Jutras, who taught AP U.S. History for nine years. “AP African American Studies  what its doing is trying to balance the equation and giving a greater bandwidth to part of U.S. history that is oftentimes neglected.”\nJutras said the legislation proposed by Cardin and Mfume would have minimal impact in Baltimore City schools.\n“I definitely see a need for it in maybe some other districts in the state of Maryland,” Jutras said in an interview with Capital News Service. “And, of course, if national legislation would follow, theres certainly states that could use those kinds of protections, but in Baltimore City, we have a long history of genuinely appreciating academic freedom.”\nAt a hearing earlier this month by the House Education and the Workforce Committee, Virginia Gentles, director of the Education Freedom Center at the Independent Women’s Forum, a conservative nonprofit, said she “absolutely” supports the teaching of African American history in schools.\nHowever, she added: “I don’t think from a federal perspective that Congress needs to get involved in what a state should or shouldn’t teach. That isn’t the role of the federal government.”\nDuring the hearing, Rep. Aaron Bean, R-Florida, defended his state’s choice to restrict the teaching of critical race theory.\n“Let’s teach subjects that matter, reading, writing, arithmetic. The so-called CRT, (critical race theory) we’ve said ‘no’ in the state of Florida, ‘no’ to CRT. There’s no value. There’s no value to teach kids to hate each other based on race. There’s no value in teaching kids to feel guilty just because they’re of a certain race,” Bean said.\nRep. Susan Wild, D-Pennsylvania, countered: “CRT, otherwise known as critical race theory, is not taught in K-12 schools ever. This is a talking point that has been used by the opposition party to try to inflame parents and people and it is simply not done, and we need to stop talking about it.”"

    "title": "White House 2023 Christmas Ornament honors President Gerald R. Ford",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  The White House Historical Association on Tuesday unveiled its Official 2023 White House Christmas Ornament honoring the 38th president of the United States, Gerald R. Ford. \nEach year for President’s Day, the association releases a custom ornament honoring a former president. A team of up to 20 people work on planning and designing the American-made ornaments throughout the year.\n“The ornaments serve as a wonderful teaching tool designed to tell the story of the White House during a specific presidency or anniversary,” said Stewart McLaurin, president of the White House Historical Association. “Through these collectibles, we’ve been able to further our mission to protect, preserve, and provide public access to the rich history of Americas Executive Mansion.”\n\nWASHINGTON  The White House 2023 Christmas ornament in its gift box. (Photo courtesy of the White House Historical Association)\nThe 2023 ornament, a three-dimensional wreath, features symbols on the front inspired by the First Lady Betty Ford’s White House decorations that could be recreated on Christmas trees at home, Matthew Costello, senior historian at the White House Historical Association, said.\n“One thing that Betty Ford did, and it was reflective of the times, was this old-fashioned, handcrafted Christmas,” Costello said. “This was a feature amongst their Christmas decorations every year that they were at the White House.”\nThe front of the wreath is adorned with tiny decorations including dolls, doves, stars, candles, and gingerbread men, as well as red ribbons with “Christmas 2023” and “The White House.”\nOn the back of the ornament are a series of emblems relating to the life and presidency of Ford and a gold plaque featuring the North Portico of the White House.\nA member of the House since 1949, Ford was nominated as vice president by Richard Nixon in 1973 after the resignation of the previous vice president, Spiro Agnew. Ford assumed the presidency just 10 months later when Nixon resigned over the Watergate scandal. Ford was the only president to have never been elected to the office of vice president or president. \nFord is also the only president to become an Eagle Scout, the highest achievable rank in the Boy Scouts of America, an accomplishment that is referenced in the “Troop 15” emblem on the White House ornament.\n“Gerald Ford was either one of our most, or our most, athletic presidents,” Costello said. “He played collegiate football at University of Michigan and was offered contracts to play professionally but he decided not to and went to law school instead, which was probably a good decision.”\nA football with Ford’s jersey number 48 is featured at the top of the ornament’s wreath alongside a line portrait of Liberty, the Ford family’s famous golden retriever, who had a litter of puppies in the White House.\nWASHINGTON  The reverse side of the 2023 White House Christmas ornament, with symbols honoring Gerald R. Ford. (Photo courtesy of the White House Historical Association\nThe ornament also features a bicentennial pin, commemorating the Ford family’s celebration of the 200-year anniversary of America’s founding, and an emblem for the U.S.S. Gerald R Ford, a first-in-class aircraft carrier commissioned to honor the president’s service in the Navy.\n“All of these different element emblems tell us a part of the story of who Gerald Ford was and you know, what he did earlier in his life, and what took place when he was president of the United States,” Costello said. \nProceeds from the ornaments fund the White House Historical Association’s educational work, Costello said, including a teacher institute and resources, public programming, a web series called “White House History Live,” and research initiatives.\nThe association is a private, nonprofit organization founded in 1961 by First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy.\nThe popular Christmas ornaments date to 1981. That first ornament depicted a flying angel. The next year, the ornament honored George Washington; subsequent ornaments have honored each president in order."

    "title": "In Maryland union hall visit, Biden touts economic initiatives",
    "content": "LANHAM, Md.  President Joe Biden on Wednesday highlighted several key points of his economic plan — improving infrastructure, funding accessible health care, emphasizing American manufacturing and lowering the deficit — during a speech to friendly union workers.\n“We got more work to do,” Biden said at the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local Union 26 here. “But it’s never been a good idea to bet against America, and I can honestly say as I stand here today that Ive never been more optimistic about Americas future.”\nIt was a familiar line in a 30-minute speech that echoed his State of the Union Address on Feb. 7. Biden also reiterated his pledge to protect Social Security and Medicare and tax Fortune 500 companies, part of what he is calling a “blue collar blueprint.”\n\n\nLANHAM, Md.  President Joe Biden snaps a selfie after speaking Wednesday about his economic policies before members of the LANHAM, Md.

(Ian Decker/Capital News Service)\nAccompanied by notable state and congressional leaders, including Maryland Gov. Wes Moore, Sen. Ben Cardin and Rep. Glenn Ivey, Biden also touted his efforts to reduce carbon emissions by building charging stations, improve transportation infrastructure  including replacing an aging railroad tunnel in Baltimore  and reduce the costs of prescription drugs such as insulin.\nBy contrast, “our Republican friends are doubling down on the same failed politics of the past: top-down, trickle-down economics. There is not much trickle-down…at most kitchen tables in America,” the president said.\nIvey said he endorsed the president’s message, saying there is a lot of positive news to spread, especially at the IBEW, which he said has been a backbone union in Prince Georges County for ages.\n“I think the key thing were trying to do right now is make sure the American people hear about all the things that are coming,” Ivey told Capital News Service, “from funds, reductions in costs from prescription drugs, infrastructure, build out spending, internet access, all of those things I think are important for him to tell.”\nBiden repeated his call for Republican lawmakers to pass his proposal for a minimum billionaire tax and to increase the minimum tax requirements for billion-dollar companies.\n“No billionaire should pay a lower tax than a school teacher,” Biden said.\nAfter criticizing the Trump administration for sending the country further into debt by enacting tax cuts for the wealthy, Biden said his proposed tax reforms involving large corporations would help decrease the U.S. deficit.\n“If Republicans try to take away peoples health care, increase costs within class families and push Americans into poverty, Im gonna stop it,” Biden said.\nThe union members positioned behind the president held signs with slogans such as “IBEW 26 Stands with Joe” and “IBEW + Biden = Perfect Union.”\n“Biden’s very much been committed to the worker and especially to unions,” B. Travis Brown, a fourth-year apprentice at IBEW, said in an interview with CNS. “Its great to see him continue to work on legislation thats going to help middle-class people and help families. That was one of the promises that he campaigned on, and its just really nice to see him continuing to put that plan into action.”\nRoland Carter, president of IBEW Local 70, where he has been a member for 24 years, said he was grateful that the president came to speak to union workers.\n“It’s a big deal, especially for union workers and for workers, period. Its showing that hes not about a bunch of talk. Hes about action… and its trickling down to where it’s supposed to be, to the middle class,” he said.\n“I hope it creates in the minds of the young people who are coming up behind us, that they have to continue to push for the same exact things that he’s (Biden) is pushing for,” Carter added.\nMatt McLaughlin, a union member of Amalgamated Transit Union Local 1300 in Baltimore, said he felt reassured by Biden’s speech, both as a union member and as someone who uses insulin.\n“One thing that this country does is they tend to discard their seniors. We shouldn’t do that,” McLaughlin said.\nEarlier in the day, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, offered a far different view of White House policies in a speech on the Senate floor.\n“We’ve now had 21 straight months above 5% annual inflation. A mind-boggling policy failure,” the senator said. “And what does the White House have to say about it? Yesterday the president’s press secretary proclaimed, ‘the president’s economic plan is indeed working.’”\n“So I guess the official White House position is that Democrats caused all this crushing inflation on purpose,” McConnell said. “This is the kind of insanity that has left just 16% of Americans saying they’re in a better financial position than they were two years ago.”"

    "title": "Despite cleanup efforts, Chesapeake Bay remains pollution challenge",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  Despite decades of conservation efforts, the Chesapeake Bay Foundation gave the overall health of the Chesapeake Bay a D+  in its recently released 2022 State of the Bay report. \nIn fact, the needle has hardly moved since the Chesapeake Bay Foundation began issuing the annual report in 1998. The original report gave the bay a score of 27 out of 100. Today that score has only improved to 32 out of 100. \nCBF’s Interim Maryland Executive Director Erik Fisher told Capital News Service: “Were a long way from where we need to be, and its clear that we have to pick up the pace to get back on track. We are behind. I dont think anyones happy with where we are.”\nThe bay faces a long road ahead: the goal is to raise the score to at least 70 out of 100, which is a long way from the current 32. \n“I think we recognize that in our lifetimes, well never be back to the bay of pre-European settlement,” Fisher said. “But we can have a stable, thriving ecosystem where we can feed ourselves, where we can swim, and fish and meet those standards that were all aiming for.”\nOne issue hindering conservation progress is a dramatic decline in water-related pollution enforcement. Between 2016-2021, Maryland took 67% fewer water-related enforcement actions, according to the 2022 Chesapeake Accountability Project report. \nThe Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) is significantly understaffed as well. The agency has lost one out of every seven staff members since 2002 and the budget has fallen by more than one-third. In spite of the threats posed by climate change, MDE’s budget only represents one-fifth of one percent of Maryland’s general fund state budget. \nEven with more resources, the changing environment presents significant hurdles for conservation efforts. Fisher said that “climate change has moved the goalposts.” \nClimate change makes hitting the restoration targets for the bay significantly more challenging. For one thing, there needs to be enough oxygen in the water for fish to breathe, but warmer water holds less oxygen. That means there needs to be even greater reductions in nitrogen and phosphorus pollution to make the bay thrive. \nRising sea levels are a major factor as well. As the seas rise, marshes and wetlands will be lost without plans in place that allow those marshes to move. Luckily, there are spillover benefits to shoreline conservation. \n“Climate change is making it even more imperative that we focus on these natural filter solutions,” Fisher said.  “And while we’re doing it we’re capturing carbon. And when we do it near communities we’re also cooling the air and mitigating heat island effects.”\nBay grasses on the Susquehanna Flats in Harford County, Maryland (Photo courtesy of Chesapeake Bay Program)\nNatural filters are more than just a matter of tall grasses and wetlands. Fisher said he hopes to see Gov. Wes Moore’s administration make “a concerted investment in natural filters in Maryland. And that’s everything from our forests to our shorelines to oysters. All three of these things act as natural kidneys for the bay.” \nOn the campaign trail, Moore pledged to clean up the Chesapeake Bay. In January, Moore announced there would be $1.1 million in new funding for the Chesapeake Conservation Corps. Additionally, the Moore administration’s proposed budget for fiscal year 2024 includes funding for 67 new MDE employees. \nThe staffing issues and lax enforcement at MDE have spilled past the Chesapeake Bay. Last September, officials in Baltimore issued a “boil water” advisory after detecting E. coli bacteria in the city’s water supply. The advisory lasted for nearly a week and affected more than 1,500 homes and businesses. \nWhether or not the Moore administration’s proposals reinvigorate MDE, Fisher remains optimistic about the work CBF is doing, \n“One of the exciting things that weve seen in the cleanup is that when we help the bay, the bay starts to build enough resilience to help itself,” he said."

    "title": "Southwest official on December service meltdown: “We messed up”",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  Southwest Airlines’ Chief Operations Officer Andrew Watterson told senators Thursday the carrier “messed up” when its holiday meltdown in December left millions of passengers scrambling.\nA “cascade” of factors, including a winter storm and outdated crew-tracking technology, caused the airline to cancel more than 16,700 flights over the Christmas week, Capt. Casey Murray, president of the Southwest Airlines Pilots Association, said during a hearing by the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee.\nBaltimore-Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport, one of Southwest’s major bases, saw hundreds of canceled flights at the height of the disruptions. Nationwide, some 2 million passengers were stranded. \n“Let me be clear, we messed up,” Watterson said. “In hindsight, we did not have enough winter operations this Christmas week.”\nFrontline workers saw this meltdown coming and have been “sounding alarm bells” for decades, seeing similar disruptions happen more frequently with increasing severity, Murray said. \n“Our pilots have been sounding the alarm about Southwest’s inadequate crew scheduling technology and outdated operational processes,” Murray said. “Unfortunately, those warnings have been summarily ignored by Southwest leaders.”\nSen. Ed Markey, D-Massachusetts, said that Southwest’s mismanagement of the situation “absolutely led to real pain and conflict” for his constituents. \nA software update that could have mitigated many of the cancellations will go live on Friday, Watterson said, but the overall scheduling technology will remain while the company conducts its investigation and looks for a replacement.\n“Right now we are doing a top to bottom review of our winter operations and when it comes out it may be in the millions and millions of dollars,” Watterson told senators. “But it wont be until probably in March that well finish the assessment of exactly how much and where.”\nThe “root cause” of the disruptions was insufficient winter weather operations, Watterson said, specifically at airports in Denver and Chicago, where the wave of cancellations started when Southwest could not de-ice enough planes to meet demand.\nSouthwest plans to invest $1.3 billion to modernize its operations across all departments in response to the incident, Watterson said, and will “fund what’s necessary to proceed” after a review.\nThe airline has reimbursed 96% of requests from affected passengers, Watterson told reporters after the hearing, automatically approving any costs under $4,000.\nSenators at the hearing told stories from constituents of unfulfilled requests, cross-country drives in expensive rental cars, and losses that could not be regained with money. \n“They can’t really be reimbursed for the time and frustration of being in that technical situation,” said Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wisconsin. “Theres so many other factors (affecting delayed passengers) and because of Southwest cancellations.” \nThursday’s committee hearing is part of the panel’s consideration of policy recommendations in the Federal Aviation Administration reauthorization bill to improve protections for passengers and build more resilient airline operations. \n“It is my hope that we use the reauthorization opportunity to push the FAA safety and technology into the 21st century, to protect competition and to resist the temptation to get into the business of regulating prices, which will only make air traffic air travel unaffordable,” said Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, ranking member of the committee."

    "title": "Statue of notorious Dred Scott justice removed from Capitol",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  The bust of Roger Taney, the justice who wrote the notorious 1857 Dred Scott decision ruling African Americans were not citizens, has been removed from the United States Capitol, an effort led by Maryland Sens. Ben Cardin and Chris Van Hollen and Maryland Rep. Steny Hoyer. \nThe statue will be replaced by a new work honoring Justice Thurgood Marshall, a champion of civil rights.\nTaney’s bust for years was in the Old Supreme Court Chamber in the Capitol. Its removal was announced Monday by the senators and Hoyer. \nCardin and Van Hollen sponsored legislation passed in December directing the removal of Taney’s bust and the placement of a new bust of Marshall, the first African American to serve on the Supreme Court.  \n“Roger Taney and others who actively helped prolong slavery should find no home within the walls of the U.S. Capitol,” Cardin said in a statement. “Thurgood Marshall helped advance civil rights in this nation and inspired a generation of legal minds…It is wholly appropriate that such a legal icon have a place of honor.”\nIn one of the most infamous decisions the court has issued, Taney, born in Calvert County, Maryland, delivered the majority opinion in Dred Scott v. Sandford, which refused Black Americans the right to citizenship and ruled unconstitutional the Missouri Compromise of 1820, which sought to limit the spread of slavery in new territories in the upper Plains and the West.\nMarshall, born in Baltimore in 1908, became one of the nation’s most prominent civil rights lawyers and argued 32 cases before the Supreme Court. He was nominated to the high court by President Lyndon Johnson in 1967 and confirmed later that year. Marshall retired from the court in 1991 and died in 1993. \n“It’s fitting that we’ve finally removed from display the likeness of former Justice Taney, who…used his power on the Supreme Court to deny African Americans their most basic legal rights,” Van Hollen said in a statement. “In its place we will see the bust of former Justice Thurgood Marshall, a Marylander we are proud to celebrate for his trailblazing efforts to advance civil rights and justice for all.”\nReplacing Taney with Marshall is part of a recent movement to eliminate artwork commemorating former slave-owning and Confederate historical figures from prominent locations in the Capitol. The House in June 2021 voted to remove all Confederate statues and busts in the Capitol from public display, but the measure did not clear the Senate. \nA recent Washington Post analysis of more than 400 works of art in the Capitol found that over 33 percent depicted enslavers or Confederates — most notably, the statues of Jefferson Davis, Christopher Columbus and Joseph Wheeler, a Confederate cavalry general who staunchly supported secession. \n“When millions of visitors to the Capitol walked past Taney’s bust each year, they saw the worst that America has to offer,” Hoyer said in a statement. “Thanks to this same legislation, they will soon see the best America has to offer when walking past a new bust of civil-rights icon Justice Thurgood Marshall.”\nIn Annapolis, Maryland lawmakers also have shown a willingness to replace historical figures with unscrupulous pasts with those who positively contributed to society. Just last month, legislators worked to successfully replace a portrait of likely enslaver Cecilus Calvert with Marshall in the Maryland Senate building in Annapolis.\nThe Cardin-Van Hollen legislation charges the Joint Committee on the Library of Congress with obtaining, and most likely commissioning, a bust of Marshall. \nUnder the joint committees direction, the Architect of the Capitol will install the bust in a prominent location near the Old Supreme Court Chamber in the Capitol."

    "title": "Maryland&#8217;s Van Hollen wants Congress to address medical debt practices",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Maryland, hopes to reform medical debt practices with the introduction of legislation that would curb unfair policies and protect consumers.\nVan Hollen and co-sponsor Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Connecticut, announced the bill Nov. 30. \nThe Maryland lawmaker and Murphy first sponsored the legislation in 2020. The bill, called the Strengthening Consumer Protections and Medical Debt Transparency Act, failed to pass before the end of 2020.\n“When folks are sick or in the hospital the last thing they should be worried about is whether they’ll lose their house or their wages for seeking care,” Van Hollen said in a statement. “This legislation puts safeguards in place to ensure transparency, cap interest rates, and keep the focus on patients’ health and wellbeing so they can get the care they need.”\nIf passed, the measure would require health care institutions to communicate about debt with consumers and cap the annual interest rate growth for medical debt at 5%.\nThe legislation also calls on the Department of Health and Human Services to create a database for public information about medical debt collection practices from hospitals and other providers.\nAdditionally, the bill includes consumer protections like checking for insurance coverage assistance before a provider sends debt to collection agencies and that health care entities must provide patients with itemized bills and payment receipts.\n“Forcing people to go bankrupt just because they get sick is immoral — plain and simple,” Murphy said in a statement. “We need to shed light on the hospitals out there who are abusing patients with overly aggressive debt collection practices.”\nIn 2021, 12% of Maryland residents had medical debts in collection, according to a study by the Urban Institute.\nA 2020 Gonzales poll by Economic Action Maryland showed that 34% of Marylanders would not be able to pay an unexpected $500 medical bill.\nMedical debt also disproportionately affects Black people. In Maryland, 24% of Black residents said they delayed seeking medical care because of costs compared to 12% of white people.\n“Unlike a lot of other debts, no one chooses to get sick,” said Marceline White, executive director of Economic Action Maryland, an organization that has helped pass legislation targeting unfair medical debt practices.\n“You cant cost-comparison shop when youre in an ambulance on the way to a hospital,” she said. “So many families simply dont have the resources to absorb that kind of unexpected financial blow, which can be catastrophic.”\nWhite said the new bill by Van Hollen and Murphy is a positive step for the country and targets the “most egregious” medical debt practices.\nShe stressed the importance of reform with the backdrop of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and said there has been broad support in Maryland for this type of legislation.\n“I think we are going to see continued strains on our health care system, and on many families who are having chronic illnesses sort of post-pandemic post-COVID,” White said. “I think this should be something that most Americans and most members of Congress can agree upon. At least I would certainly hope so.”\nRIP Medical Debt is a charity established to reduce the burden of medical debt on low-income families using donations, paying off over $7 billion of debt since 2014 for over 4 million people. CEO and president of RIP Medical Debt, Allison Sesso, is enthusiastic about federal attention to the topic.\n“We must do more to protect patients from medical debt and ensure people get the health care they need without fear of incurring debt,” Sesso said in a statement to Capital News Service. “(The bill) takes positive steps toward addressing the data challenges we face in understanding the prevalence of medical debt so we can better target policy solutions and more closely monitor the use of extraordinary collection actions.”"

    "title": "Supreme Court considers the ultimate power of state legislatures in elections",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  The Supreme Court heard arguments Wednesday in an election dispute out of North Carolina that could reshape the balance of power in American electoral politics.\nThe case stems from a dispute between North Carolina’s legislature and state supreme court, which ruled that a gerrymandered redistricting map drawn by legislators was incompatible with the state constitution. The North Carolina State Supreme Court then drew a new map giving equal representation to Republicans and Democrats; the legislature then sued.\nAttorneys for the North Carolina legislature are basing their argument on something called “independent state legislature” theory, which is the idea that state legislatures can regulate state and federal elections without input from the state courts and over the constraints of state constitutions.\nNeither side is arguing that the North Carolina Supreme Court ruled unfairly; rather, attorney David Thompson contended that the state court did not have the authority to weigh in on the map in the first place.\n“We say, ‘take the North Carolina Supreme Courts decision on face value and as fairly reflecting North Carolina law,’ and when one does that, we see that theres a violation of the Elections Clause, and thats why were here,” Thompson said.\nSome scholars worry about the potential broader implications of a ruling in favor of the independent state legislature theory.\n“Although its called the independent state legislature theory, really the way it would function is to transfer power, not from state courts to the state legislature, but from state courts to the Supreme Court,” said Carolyn Shapiro, law professor and co-director of the Institute on the Supreme Court of the United States at Chicago-Kent College of Law.\nShe also filed an amicus brief on behalf of the plaintiffs.\n“The U.S. Supreme Court would become the arbiter of all of these election disputes,” she said.\nJustice Elena Kagan echoed those worries during oral arguments.\n“This is a theory with big consequences,” she said. “It would say that if a legislature engages in the most extreme forms of gerrymandering, there is no state constitutional remedy for that, even if the courts think that’s a violation of the Constitution.”\nThat could impact federal elections on lots of levels, Kagan added.\n“It would say legislatures could enact all manner of restrictions on voting, get rid of all kinds of voter protections that the state constitution in fact prohibits,” the justice said. “It might allow the legislatures to insert themselves, to give themselves a role in the certification of elections and the way election results are calculated.”\nShapiro worries this could create chaos in determining the results of the 2024 elections.\n“You could imagine how things might have gone differently in Arizona, for example, in 2020, if the legislature had been in charge of deciding who really won, as opposed to having election professionals do and courts oversee the process,” she said.\nThis argument has drawn broad criticism from the right and left alike, but the previously obscure theory has gained new currency in conservative legal circles. Justices Neil Gorsuch, Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito previously expressed support for the theory, Shapiro said.\n“But all of those opinions were written when cases were on the shadow docket, and there was not full briefing and argument,” she said. “Moreover, since 2020, there has been an enormous amount of scholarship, in particular historical research, on the ISLT. That research demonstrates overwhelmingly that neither original intent, nor original public meaning, nor longstanding practice before and after the Constitution was drafted and ratified, support the ISLT.”\nAttorneys for private and state respondents argued that the independent state legislatures theory is a significant deviation from centuries of precedent.\n“For 233 years, this court has never second-guessed a state court interpretation of its own constitution in any context,” said former Solicitor General Neal Katyal, arguing on behalf of voting rights groups.\nThomas appeared skeptical.\n“Let me ask this, just as it may be a bit unfair,” he said during arguments. “If the state legislature had been very, very generous to minority voters in their redistricting, and the state supreme court said under that this violated the state constitution of North Carolina, would\nyou be making the same argument?”\nJustice Ketanji Brown Jackson expressed concerns about state legislatures superseding the authority of state constitutions.\n“I guess what I dont understand is how you can cut the state constitution out of the equation when it is giving the state legislature the authority to exercise legislative power,” she said. “Its the state constitution that is telling the legislature when and under what circumstances it can actually act as the legislature.”\n“Since Gorsuch, Thomas and (Brett) Kavanaugh, at least, are self-professed originalists, they should be willing to take a second look at their positions in light of all this new information,” Shapiro said."

    "title": "New House Democratic leaders look ahead to life in the minority",
    "content": "WASHINGTON — As Republican Rep. Kevin McCarthy struggles to gain support to become speaker, Democrats have rallied around their new leaders Hakeem Jeffries, Katherine Clark and Pete Aguilar after the dust settled from the 2022 midterm election.\n“It’s all wine and roses right now…because we are coming off a historic over-performance in terms of the House of Representatives,” Jeffries, who will be the first Black man to lead the House Democrats in January and represents New York’s 8th District, told reporters Tuesday.\nAs minority leader, Jeffries will be tasked with uniting the progressives and moderates of the party, who have clashed over policies in the past.\nSpecifically, “the squad”  progressive Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York; Ilhan Omar of Minnesota; Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts; Rashida Tlaib of Michigan; Cori Bush of Missouri and Jamaal Bowman of New York  has been vocal in its criticisms of the moderate sector of the party.\nJeffries said that it should not be difficult to find a level of unity among them.\n“At the end of the day, what unites us is our genuine, authentic commitment to putting people over politics, to fighting for lower costs for better-paying jobs for safer communities, defend democracy, fight for freedom, protect the public interest and show economic opportunity in every corner of America,” Jeffries said.\nAnother question many observers have is how the new Democratic leadership will work to bridge the gap with Republicans dominated by pro-Trump and far-right ideologues.\nThe House Republicans are struggling to coalesce around a leader. McCarthy is believed to be short of the 218 votes he needs to become speaker, largely because a handful of the most conservative members of his caucus have vowed to oppose him.\nMcCarthy’s path to the speakership may have been further complicated on Tuesday when Rep. Andy Biggs, R-Arizona, announced he would challenge McCarthy for the top post. Biggs called McCarthy “a creature of the establishment status quo.”\nAccording to the Pew Research Center, 38% of Americans believe partisan relations in Congress will get worse.\n“We are genuinely interested in trying to find common ground with the other side of the aisle to advance priorities that make life better for everyday Americans,” Jeffries said.\nHowever, common ground may be difficult, since Democrats have continued to bash the Republican Party’s recent push for abortion bans and refusals to condemn those endangering democracy.\n“There is an essential question facing Republicans. Do they have an affirmative vision for our country? Or is their only plan to divide us, suspend our Constitution, and roll the clock back on liberty?” said Clark, the incoming minority whip.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump posted on Truth Social on Saturday that “a Massive Fraud of this type and magnitude allows for the termination of all rules, regulations, and articles, even those found in the Constitution.” The post about terminating the Constitution has sowed even deeper divisions between the two parties, and Democrats continue to criticize those GOP colleagues who have not yet condemned Trump’s statement.\n“It should not be that complicated to denounce the former president,” Jeffries said.\nDemocrats also have expressed doubts that a Republican House can pass legislation raising the debt ceiling and keep the government open.\n“We also talked about the importance of preventing a GOP-led government shutdown,” said Pete Aguilar, the incoming House Democratic Caucus chairman.\nJeffries and other party leaders, including President Joe Biden, specifically have been targeting the MAGA wing of the GOP.\n“The notion that extreme MAGA Republicans would threaten to default on our nations debt for the first time in American history in order to blow up Social Security and Medicare is stunning. Its catastrophic,” Jeffries said."

    "title": "State dinner featured a champion American cheese already loved by the French",
    "content": "WASHINGTON – France may be renowned for its wine and cheeses, but at the White House’s state dinner Thursday, American fare was the guest of honor.\nThe dinner showcased American culinary achievements including wines from Napa Valley, California, 200 Maine lobsters and award-winning cheese from Oregon and Wisconsin, including world champion Rogue River Blue.\nWe came up with a menu that would highlight and express the state of America at the moment,” said White House Executive Chef Cristeta Comerford. “We are featuring beautiful things from the land and the sea.\nThe menu, organized over the course of six months by the First Lady, Comerford and White House Executive Pastry Chef Susie Morrison, included a course of three American artisanal cheeses.\nRogue River Blue cheese from Central Point, Oregon, was among the three cheeses selected, and the only one to win a world championship.\nIn 2019, Rogue River Blue became the first American-made cheese to win top prize at the Guild of Fine Food’s World Cheese Awards in Bergamo, Italy, the marquee achievement of nearly 20 years in production.\n“We really started gaining international attention in 2003 with the release of our Rogue River Blue cheese,” said Marguerite Merritt, cheese emissary at Rogue River Creamery. She’s unofficially known as the marketing manager for the nearly 90-year-old Oregon creamery.\nWASHINGTON  Cheesemonger Mark Bedford presides over choice cheeses like Rogue River Blue at Bowers Fancy Dairy Products in Washingtons Eastern Market. (Hunter Savery/Capital News Service)\nRogue River Blue won Best American Cheese and Best Blue Cheese awards at the 2003 World Cheese Awards, and is the recipient of 17 other national and international awards over the last two decades.\nIt remains the only American winner of the World Cheese Awards’ grand prize.\nComerford said the cheese was served with macerated grapes and grenadine walnuts, plus honey from the White House, of course.\nThe chef first learned about the cheese from the French.\nActually, on my trip to France a couple years ago, my chef counterparts asked me, Have you ever tried Rogue River? Its the World Champion of Cheese. And I said I never did, Comerford said.\nThe ultimate compliment: the French embassy in Washington recently bought three wheels of the cheese.\nThe cheese is wrapped in grape leaves that have been soaked in pear liqueur. The wheels then spend 9 to 11 months aging in caves. Ten thousand wheels of the cheese are released in the fall of each year, a small batch compared to the creamery’s other cheeses, Merritt said.\n“Rogue River Blue is a seasonal released cheese that we only make in the fall months, when our dairy milk is at its best,” she said. “Its only made with milk from our own certified organic dairy here in Southern Oregon.”\nThe wheels retail for $240 on the creamery’s website, and typically sell out by the new year.\nAbout three miles east of the White House, Eastern Market’s Bowers Fancy Dairy Products sells Rogue River Blue for $76 per pound.\nHow the cheese got to the White House remains unclear.\nRogue Creamery confirmed that the cheese was not purchased directly from nor was it gifted by the creamery.\nEastern Market cheesemonger Mark Bedford also denied involvement. Arrowine  Cheese in Arlington, Virginia, told Capital News Service it only received a limited supply and was sold out before the state dinner.\nThe White House so far has not responded to an inquiry about its supplier for the cheese."

    "title": "Taylor Swift, Bad Bunny top Spotify in DC this year",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  Taylor Swift and Bad Bunny dominated streams on the music platform Spotify in the nation’s capital this year.\nThe top five artists were Taylor Swift, Bad Bunny, Drake, Kanye West and The Weeknd. The top genres in Washington were pop, rap, hip hop, dance pop and trap, according to Spotify Wrapped.\nTaylor Swift’s popularity tracks with Tony Tomelden’s experience. Tomelden owns The Pug, an H Street dive bar.\nMost days, the bar plays punk, rock and hip hop music. But twice in the last month, it’s become the place to be for local Swifities. Somebody asked on Twitter for a bar that would host a listening party for the release of “Midnights,” Swift’s latest album.\n“People were like ‘well, Tony will definitely play it,’” Tomelden said. “And somebody else called in and asked if we would really do that, and I said that I couldn’t do it the night it comes out but Ill definitely do it that Monday night.”\n“And its just sort of exploded,” he added. “We already had a group of folks that watch ‘The Bachelor’ every Monday night in here. I dont know if those two things intersect totally, but there’s a base crowd of younger folks out here who love ‘The Bachelor,’ so I got a copy of it on vinyl and played it Monday night.”\nThere was a line out the door. Tomelden replicated the event with Swift’s album “Red” last Monday. He said the bar intends to do similar events on a monthly basis in the future.\nTomelden said Taylor Swift wasn’t number one on his own Spotify Wrapped, but he’s excited about the popularity of the listening parties nonetheless.\n“Me personally, I like that ‘cheerleader in the bleachers’ song,” he said. “I’m this grumpy old man, and I think its kind of fun that they come in and they sing along to every lyric, just like I did when I was that age to The Clash. It was perfect.”\n\n\nSpotify Wrapped  DC Edition by Jonathan Hunter Donville\nBad Bunny was the second-most streamed artist in Washington, but he was the number one streamed artist on Spotify in the world for the third year in a row with more than 18.5 billion streams. He was also recognized as Artist of the Year by Apple Music and Billboard.\n“He started getting on our radar around 2017 with a very distinctive sound,” said Leila Cobo, chief content officer of Latin at Billboard.\n“He has a very deep voice which is unusual for someone in his genre, which is reggaeton rap,” she said. “And himself  his persona, his vocal style, his aesthetic  was also very unusual. His music was also different, I think, a little bit more aggressive in its production, more aggressive and more streamlined. So he very quickly got a big Latin following behind him at a time when streaming was really breaking out in Latin (communities).”\nBad Bunny’s continued popularity is a unique cultural moment, Cobo said. Other artists  like Shakira, Ricky Martin, Mark Anthony and Jennifer Lopez  have historically been number one on the global charts. But there’s never been a number one artist whose discography is solely in Spanish.\n“I think (the fanbase) has transcended from people that only speak Spanish to people that dont speak Spanish and dont care, and someone like Bad Bunny was very effective at doing that,” Cobo said. “And I dont think he was trying to do that.”\nHis music just happens to be very danceable,” she said. “Its very catchy. So even if people dont understand what the heck hes saying, they like it and they like him. And thats really opened up the door, I think, for a lot of other artists.”"

    "title": "Despite decline in death penalty, Supreme Court backs states carrying out executions",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  While the use of the death penalty has waned nationally, the Supreme Court has continued to give the green light for states to carry out executions.\nThe Supreme Court on Nov. 18 condemned an Alabama man to death in an order issued at 11:20 p.m. The late-night decision overturned a lower court’s stay of execution and allowed Alabama to proceed. As fate would have it, there would be no execution.\nAlabama officials were unable to successfully administer the lethal cocktail of drugs to Kenneth Eugene Smith before his death warrant expired at midnight. Alabama’s governor then put a pause on executions.\nBefore reaching the Supreme Court, the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in favor Smith’s claim that there were issues with Alabama’s execution methods based on a previous botched execution. The Supreme Court overturned this ruling in the middle of the night without ever having heard full arguments.\n\n                    var divElement = document.getElementById('viz1669918086347');                    var vizElement = divElement.getElementsByTagName('object')[0];                    if ( divElement.offsetWidth > 800 ) { vizElement.style.width='780px';vizElement.style.height='567px';} else if ( divElement.offsetWidth > 500 ) { vizElement.style.width='780px';vizElement.style.height='567px';} else { vizElement.style.width='100%';vizElement.style.height='727px';}                     var scriptElement = document.createElement('script');                    scriptElement.src = 'https://public.tableau.com/javascripts/api/viz_v1.js';                    vizElement.parentNode.insertBefore(scriptElement, vizElement);                \nAs of Dec. 1, more people have been executed in 2022 than in all of 2021. There have been 17 executions so far this year. In 2021 there were only 11, which was the lowest number since 1988.\n“What were seeing in U.S. executions and new death sentences is that theres been a sustained decline in the use of the death penalty,” Ngozi Ndulue, deputy director of the Death Penalty Information Center, told Capital News Service. “Now, of course, executions are a lagging indicator of that decline, because were having executions of people who had been sentenced to death, decades beforehand, but overall, we see states just being less and less likely to resort to the death penalty.”\n\n                    var divElement = document.getElementById('viz1669918206465');                    var vizElement = divElement.getElementsByTagName('object')[0];                    if ( divElement.offsetWidth > 800 ) { vizElement.style.width='780px';vizElement.style.height='567px';} else if ( divElement.offsetWidth > 500 ) { vizElement.style.width='780px';vizElement.style.height='567px';} else { vizElement.style.width='100%';vizElement.style.height='727px';}                     var scriptElement = document.createElement('script');                    scriptElement.src = 'https://public.tableau.com/javascripts/api/viz_v1.js';                    vizElement.parentNode.insertBefore(scriptElement, vizElement);                \nStates planning on carrying out executions have faced significant hurdles in recent years as export restrictions have made it difficult to obtain the drugs necessary to carry out lethal injections and pharmaceutical companies have sought to avoid the negative public image associated with the drugs.\nIn 2011, the European Union banned the export of drugs like sodium thiopental, which it says “could be used for capital punishment or torture.” The reduced supply has led states to turn to less preferred drugs or to compounding pharmacies, facilities not authorized by the FDA, which mix their own chemicals on an individual basis.\n“As soon as this issue became more prominent, no pharmaceutical company really wanted their drugs to be used for executions,” Ndule said. “They see it as not consistent with what the drugs were created for and also, I think they see some potential reputational harm if their drugs are kind of seen as the drugs that are used to kill people.”\nThe Texas Tribune has found that Texas, which is in many years the nationwide leader in executions, has only nine available doses of lethal injection drugs available. Texas currently has eight executions scheduled, but seven of the state’s nine doses are slated to expire on Dec. 8.\nActivists hoped that the scarcity of lethal injection drugs would make executions unfeasible or lead to lethal injections being ruled in violation of the Eighth Amendment because of the unreliability of substitute drugs. However, the court has been largely unsympathetic to these claims.\nSource: Death Penalty Information Center (DPIC).\nIn 2015, the court ruled 5-4 in Glossip v. Gross that the use of ersatz drug cocktails for executions was not unconstitutional because the death penalty is constitutional and it always contains a risk of pain.\nGlossip established the standard that when convicts challenge a specific method of execution, they have to propose an alternative method.\nJustice Samuel Alito wrote in the court’s majority opinion: “Because some risk of pain is inherent in any method of execution, we have held that the Constitution does not require the avoidance of all risk of pain…After all, while most humans wish to die a painless death, many do not have that good fortune. Holding that the Eighth Amendment demands the elimination of essentially all risk of pain would effectively outlaw the death penalty altogether.”\nTwenty-three states have outright abolished the death penalty and three more, California, Oregon and Pennsylvania, have governor-imposed moratoria.\nThe election of Donald Trump presented a change. The Department of Justice under Trump carried out a record wave of executions.  In 2020, the Trump administration resumed imposing the death penalty after a 17-year moratorium.\nThe Trump administration carried out executions with unprecedented speed: between July 2020 and Trump’s leaving office in Jan. 2021, the federal government executed more prisoners than in the previous 56 years combined. Even days before President Joe Biden’s inauguration, the Department of Justice raced to carry out executions.\nPresident Biden, for his part, has not resumed the federal execution moratorium, as opponents of the death penalty had hoped he would.\nWith the Supreme Court’s seal of approval, outlier states are continuing to forge ahead with executions. Oklahoma, for example, has scheduled 25 executions over the next two years.\nHowever, the number of executions and death sentences is in decline. Even if the Supreme Court continues to sign off on executions, it may make little difference in the overall direction away from executions and death sentences.\n“The long-term trend remains the same throughout the country. What we see is that outliers crop up,” Ndule said. “Some jurisdictions that are outlier jurisdictions will continue to try to execute and could end up with an outsized proportion of executions, while the vast majority of jurisdictions will have no executions.”"

    "title": "Trump dinner just one indicator of rising antisemitic rhetoric and incidents",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  The furor over former President Donald Trump’s dinner with notorious antisemite Nick Fuentes and controversial rapper Kanye West underscores a recent surge in antisemitic incidents and rhetoric on social media and in American society.\nAccording to the American Jewish Committee and the Anti-Defamation League, public figures like Trump and West are “normalizing” antisemitic speech, and it has influenced the growth of antisemitic rhetoric on social media platforms including Twitter. \nMeanwhile, antisemitic assaults, harassment and vandalism are projected to increase after reaching new highs in 2021, according to the ADL.\nGrowing antisemitism was the focus of a meeting among government officials, members of Congress and nonprofit organizations at the United States Capitol on Tuesday. The session was convened by Sen. Ben Cardin, D-Maryland, who is chairman of the U.S. Helsinki Commission and special representative on antisemitism, racism, and intolerance for the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) Parliamentary Assembly. \n“We can and should be doing more,” Cardin said in a statement. “A unified, national strategy on countering antisemitism is needed. While finding the proper balance between protecting free speech and protecting Americans from harm, we need to up our game, rebuild coalitions with other groups that have been the target of hate-based violence, and institutionalize coordination that counters antisemitism wherever it is found.”\n“We cannot allow antisemitism to be mainstreamed, nor can fighting it become a partisan issue,” the senator said.\nImmediately following billionaire Elon Musk’s acquisition of Twitter last month, the Center for Strategic Communication at Montclair State University tracked an increase in hate speech across the platform. \nBond Benton, a Montclair professor of communication and media, said Musk signaled that speech would be less moderated under his leadership. Benton said the initial spike in hate speech faded quickly, but hate speech incidents have yet to return to pre-Musk levels.\n“The second that you say ‘were going to reduce moderation,’ it doesnt enhance free speech. It can almost overwhelm free speech with the amount of negative content that you would see,” the professor said. “Weve seen that on a lot of free speech-absolutist platforms, which have really become havens for hate groups and extremists and misinformation.” \nThe MSU report found that in the hours after Musk acquired Twitter, use of a slur against Jewish people increased 23%, although the actual number of tweets containing the slur remained relatively low.\n“The thing that we were a little bit concerned about is when we analyzed the spike in hate speech, we saw that potential impressions were actually pretty high. Thats kind of the danger of Twitter,” Benton said. “It is a fairly small number of accounts posting really bad stuff that can be seen by way more people on the platform.” \nThe posts MSU tracked had the potential to be viewed 3 million times, Benton said. \nThe group also measured how many tweets mentioned the words “Zionist” and “globalist”  which are sometimes used in white nationalist circles to mean Jewish  after the Musk acquisition. In the pre-Musk days, users might see 200 tweets in a day mentioning “globalist”; in the days after the acquisition, the high point was 1,100 tweets, about a 500% increase. \nTweets referencing “Zionist” peaked at about 700 tweets an hour, up from 150 in a day. \nAlthough the terms could have been used inoffensively, Benton said he didn’t think it was arbitrary that their usage increased so dramatically alongside terms hateful to other groups.\n“I dont want to overstate it. Were not saying that this overwhelmed Twitter or anything like that,” he said. “But were just seeing that terms pejoratively used against the Jewish community are being used more.”\nThe AJC’s U.S. director for combatting antisemitism, Holly Huffnagle, said “conspiratorial antisemitism” on social media has been increasing for over a decade. But only recently has the country witnessed an increase in “real-life responses and actions” of this volume, she said.\nIn the spring of 2021, the ADL recorded the highest number of antisemitic incidents  including cases of assault, harassment and vandalism  in their annual audit since it began tracking in 1979. \nThe “2021 Audit of Antisemitic Incidents” showed that there were over 2,700 incidents, with an average of “more than seven incidents per day and a 34% increase year over year.” \n“Looking at some of the numbers in 2022, so far, there is no question that the numbers are continuing to increase,” Meredith Weisel, the ADL’s regional director for Washington, D.C., said. The 2022 audit is expected to be released in the spring.\nLast month, the AJC discovered antisemitic graffiti along the Trolley Trail in Bethesda, Maryland, a town with a sizable Jewish population. Three hangmen were painted in red along with the words “no mercy for Jews,” a large swastika and the neo-Nazi slogan “1488.” \nSimilar antisemitic graffiti has been found on the same trail twice over three months, Weisel told Capital News Service.   \n“We have seen national leaders and local leaders in government who, in the media, have served as a gateway – as a champion – for some of these radical ideologies. It validates people, promoting their bigotry and militant type of views,” Weisel said. “There are a lot of people who are buying into it.” \nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Georgia, was barred from her personal Twitter account in January after Twitter said she violated several of the platform’s policies, including one about COVID-19 misinformation. \nBut Greene has never been afraid to share her controversial views on social media. On Facebook in 2018, Greene blamed a California wildfire on “Jewish space lasers.” \nHer congressional account on Twitter has remained active. And under Musk’s control of Twitter, Greene’s personal account was up and running again, too. \nIn a tweet posted on Oct. 8, West said he “wanted to go death con 3 on Jewish people,” in a rant about the Jewish community “controlling” the entertainment industry. \n“What they don’t realize is that Jewish people were forced out of other industries years ago,” Weisel said. “Its a classic antisemitic trope to imply that Jews control the entertainment industry. People believe that, and people act out on that.”\nTwitter took down West’s tweet and locked his account a day later. However, as soon as Musk took over the platform, West’s account was restored.\n“Welcome back to Twitter, my friend,” Musk wrote in a tweet. \nBased on the increased polarization of online discourse and the changing landscapes of many social media platforms Americans use today, including Twitter, Huffnagle said finding the balance between participating in “cancel culture,” a method of public shaming, and teaching someone a lesson is essential to solving the problem.  \nBoth Huffnagle and Weisel said that they prefer to participate in what they call “counsel culture” instead. \n“The reality of hate speech is protected speech,” Weisel said. “So, our motto here is that we want to counter hate speech with good speech — and with education.”"

    "content": "WASHINGTON — Outgoing House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Maryland, has started transitioning into a new role after stepping away from his leadership position Nov. 17.\nHoyer said he looks forward to returning to the House Appropriations Committee, where he served during the years when he was not in party leadership.\n“Im going back to a committee that I think is one of the critical committees in the Congress of the United States,” Hoyer told reporters on Tuesday.\nThroughout his time on the committee, he secured funding for many projects in St. Marys, Calvert, Charles, Prince George’s and Anne Arundel Counties, which comprise his district.\nHoyer said he has prioritized his constituents throughout his tenure in leadership, but now he looks forward to dedicating more time focused on the interests of the 5th District.\n“Im going to a position that I think will give me the opportunity to do that,” Hoyer said.\nThe Maryland Democrat has been in the House since 1981 and served as the second-ranking Democrat in the House since 2003. He was considered to be in line for his party’s top post, but when he announced he was leaving leadership he said “now is the time for a new generation of leaders.”\nHouse Democrats on Wednesday elected Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, D-New York, as their new leader, replacing Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-California, who has been given the title “speaker emerita.”\nHoyer’s role will be filled by Rep. Katherine Clark, D-Massachusetts, who will be the minority whip in the next Congress. Rep. Pete Aguilar, D-California, will be caucus chairman. Jeffries is 52, Clark 59, and Aguilar 43  a trio representing the younger generation in the caucus.\nThe new leaders were announced on the same day Pelosi and Hoyer announced their plans to step down. Wednesday’s votes formally endorsed the new, uncontested leaders.\n“What you saw… was a change of generational leadership within our party in a very unified fashion, which I think is good for our party and its good for the country,” Hoyer said Tuesday.\nHoyer said he will lend his experience and guidance to Jeffries and Clark whenever they need it. Even though he is no longer in leadership, Hoyer said he still has his passion to make a difference in Congress, pushing his agenda forward and helping Democrats campaign in future elections.\n“You wouldnt expect me to disappear. Thats just not my personality,” Hoyer said.\nEven though he is one of the oldest members in the House, Hoyer said he is still as excited about his job as ever.\n“At 83, I’m doing pretty well,” Hoyer said."

    "title": "Supreme Court hears arguments over immigration arrest policy",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  The Supreme Court heard arguments Tuesday over Biden administration guidelines that put a priority on arresting noncitizens with criminal backgrounds or those who pose a threat to national security.\nIn September 2021, the Department of Homeland Security released immigration enforcement guidelines that prioritized the apprehension and removal of three classes of noncitizens, including those who pose a threat to national security, public safety, or border security.\nTexas and Louisiana sued to stop the guidelines; the 5th Circuit Court decided in their favor and issued an order stopping the guidelines from being implemented nationwide.\nThe federal government is calling for a reversal of that decision, arguing that the district court only had authority to grant an injunction to the parties before it, therefore pausing the guidelines in Texas and Louisiana during the legal process, rather than removing the policy entirely.\nThe Biden administration argues that the states lack standing to sue; that the district court’s decision to vacate the guidelines was improper and that the new guidelines are consistent with a history of the government’s prosecutorial discretion.\nStates’ legal ability to sue the government based on the administration’s guidelines, especially immigration policies, is a central issue in the Supreme Court case.\nThe administration argued that states did not have standing to sue because they do not suffer direct harm from the policy. Texas and Louisiana said they faced indirect impacts like increased spending on law enforcement and social services.\n“Getting into the facts of this case, there was no basis in this record to show that the states will incur these indirect effects on their own taxing, spending, or regulating,” said U.S. Solicitor General Elizabeth Progar.\nTexas Solicitor General Judd Stone argued that states take on the danger of violent crime and costs of further incarceration if certain noncitizens are not detained by DHS immediately after release from their criminal sentences.\n“Texas suffers injuries regardless of what it does, whether it detains, releases or paroles individuals because not only do we have law enforcement costs, but social service costs, and very serious threats of recidivism,” Stone said.\nBut Justice Elena Kagan didn’t seem persuaded.\n“The fact that you are not the party directly regulated and the fact that you are challenging an enforcement action  particularly an enforcement action where the most discretion has been given to executive officials  those form the backdrop by which we should say ‘it is just not enough that you are coming in here with a set of speculative possibilities about your costs,’” she said.\nKagan also worried that this case would set a dangerous precedent of states dictating federal immigration policy.\n“This isn’t anything that has to do with this (Biden) administration  some other administration will come in and the California solicitor general where you are,” said Kagan. “Immigration policy is supposed to be the zenith of federal power, and it’s supposed to be the zenith of executive power. Instead we’re creating a system where a combination of states and courts can bring immigration policy to a dead halt.”\nJustice Ketanji Brown Jackson argued that the states made voluntary decisions to incarcerate noncitizens not considered threats by the federal government, making associated costs a self-inflicted injury.\nImplementing the guidelines falls on the discretion of ICE officers, who are asked to assess noncitizens based on “the totality of the circumstances” to determine whether they pose a threat to public safety\nThe guidelines build upon two existing provisions that require certain noncitizens to be detained during removal proceedings. One provision says that the DHS “shall take into custody” non-citizens who have committed certain offenses, while the other says that DHS “shall remove” and “shall detain” noncitizens within 90 days of a filing of a removal order.\nThe justices spent time Tuesday discussing the meaning of “shall.”\nProgar contended that “shall” cannot be interpreted literally. Expecting the DHS to apprehend, detain and remove all 11 million undocumented immigrants would be impossible given the agency’s current allocated resources, she said.\n“It is impossible for DHS to comply with each and every ‘shall’ in the (Immigration and Nationality Act),” Progar said. “We don’t have the resources or ability to go after those individuals who are threats to public safety, national security and border security. That is a senseless way to run an immigration enforcement system and it’s not the statute Congress enacted.”\nChief Justice John Roberts pushed back.\n“When we get to the merits, I think ‘shall’ means ‘shall,’” he said. “It’s our job to say what the law is, not whether or not it can be possibly implemented or whether there are difficulties there, and I don’t think we should change that responsibility because Congress and the executive can’t agree on something that is possible to address this problem.”"

    "title": "This year&#8217;s White House holiday theme: &#8220;We the People&#8221;",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  The White House has unveiled its 2022 holiday decorations. This year’s theme, “We The People,” brings a distinctively homespun feel to the White House with an emphasis on decorations that people could make at home and a sense of shared national values. \nDecorations include ornaments drawn by children in the State Dining Room, a tower of flickering candles in the Red Room and, in the China Room, the mantle is adorned with wooden spoons and well-loved family recipe cards contributed by volunteers from around the country, including First Lady Dr. Jill Biden’s own family. \nWASHINGTON  A 300-pound gingerbread White House is a featured holiday tradition in the White Houses State Dining Room. (Hunter Savery/Capital News Service)\nThe decorations were put up by over 150 volunteers from across the country and the White House expects 50,000 visitors this holiday season. The president and first lady wrote in a letter to guests, “our hope is that you feel at home and find yourself in the great story of America.” \n“When our country comes together, we are stronger. What we share is so much greater than the things that pull us apart,” Mrs. Biden said during remarks in the East Room Monday. “The soul of our nation is — and always has been — ‘We the People.’ And that is what inspired this year’s White House holiday decorations.” \nNowhere is this theme better embodied than in the Grand Foyer where rectangular mirrors and reflective metal ribbons hang from the trees. In this room, guests can quite literally see themselves in the decorations.\nWASHINGTON  Snow-covered trees representing the Great Smoky Mountains are part of the holiday decorations in the White Houses East Room. (Destiny Herbers/Capital News Service)\nThe welcoming, familial theme of this year’s decorations draws a notable contrast from former First Lady Melania Trump’s blood-red trees and opulent decorations. \nThe Bidens have taken a more DIY approach, with cardboard cutouts of the presidential dog, Commander, and cat, Willow, popping out of gift boxes and playing in the snow. \nThe State Ballroom is home to a 300-pound gingerbread White House and a sugar cookie-based replica of Philadelphia’s Independence Hall. The edible display is made up of 30 sheets of gingerbread dough, 20 sheets of sugar cookie dough, 30 pounds of chocolate and 40 pounds of icing. \nWASHINGTON  The Biden family dog, Commander, and the family cat, Willow, sit in a wintry scene at the East exit of the White House Colonnade. (Destiny Herbers/Capital News Service)\nNatural themes were woven throughout the decorations as well. In the East Room, four national parks were highlighted: The Grand Canyon, Yellowstone, Great Smoky Mountains and Shenandoah, each represented above a fireplace mantel. The East Room is the largest room in the White House and features a portrait of famed conservationist President Theodore Roosevelt. \nThe official tree, one of 77 Christmas trees on the White House grounds, is an 18-foot, 6-inch tall concolor fir from Auburn, Pennsylvania.. The tree is trimmed with representations of the official birds of all 57 U.S. states and territories, including Maryland’s Baltimore Oriole, Virginia’s Northern Cardinal and the District of Columbia’s Wood Thrush. \nThe holiday display includes a new addition to the White House’s collection, a menorah crafted from wood salvaged from a 1950 White House renovation. \nMusic filled the halls of the East Wing during a preview Monday, thanks to performances by the United States Marine Band, led by Col. Jason K. Fettig, 28th director of the United States Marine Band. The band, along with smaller ensembles scattered throughout the building, played holiday classics along with more modern additions such as “Let It Go” from the movie “Frozen.” \nWASHINGTON  The United States Marine Band, directed by Col. Jason K. Fettig, plays during a preview of White House holiday decorations. (Hunter Savery/Capital News Service)\nIn addition to the 77 Christmas trees, the White House is decked out with 83,615 lights and 25 wreaths. Planning began in the spring and the volunteers worked for a full week to put up the decorations. \n“We may celebrate different holidays—we may sing different songs or say different prayers— but our shared American values endure season after season,” Mrs. Biden said. “May the promise of ‘We The People’ light our path forward into the New Year and bring us together always. Merry Christmas and happy holidays. God bless you. God bless our troops and their families.”"

    "title": "With narrow House majority in divided Congress, GOP signals more conflict than consensus",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  While the anticipated Republican “red wave” did not materialize, the GOP-controlled House will impact President Joe Biden’s policy agenda and increase the chances for possible investigations when the divided 118th Congress convenes in January, analysts say. \n“One-party Democrat rule in Washington is finished. We have fired Nancy Pelosi,” House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-California, said in an interview with Sean Hannity on Fox News Wednesday. He hopes to be the next House speaker but is having trouble securing the necessary votes in his own divided caucus.\nPelosi, D-California, announced Thursday she would step aside from leading the House Democrats but would remain in the House.\nWith a divided government, some observers are concerned about potential government shutdowns and conflicts over the debt ceiling.\n“I think one of the outcomes will be even more of a paralysis for the government, not just the division between the White House and Congress,” said former Maryland Governor Parris Glendening, a Democrat, in an interview with Capital News Service. “When your margins are that near, its very difficult to do anything significant.”\nIt is unlikely that a Republican-controlled House would cooperate with Biden, according to Jacob Rubashkin, an analyst for Inside Elections, a nonpartisan newsletter.\n“I think that a lot of the Republicans…have very little incentive to work with Biden and the Democrats,” Rubashkin told CNS. “Their voters really dont like Biden, and they were elected off of anti-Biden sentiment.”\nPolitical stalemates could lead to Biden to rely more on his executive power to enact more of his initiatives.\n“Youre going to see Joe Biden recede into the world of executive orders and presidential memoranda, much the way Barack Obama did after losing the House (in 2010),” Todd Eberly, a political science professor at St. Mary’s College of Maryland, said in an interview with CNS.\nBy contrast, Michelle Whyman, an assistant political science professor at Florida State University, said that there is still a semblance of bipartisanship in the government and collaboration between House Republicans and Biden on the legislation could be possible.\n“American institutions are explicitly designed in order to incorporate diverse preferences,” Whyman told CNS.\nAfter the Democrats retained a narrow majority in the Senate, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-New York, called on his Republican colleagues to collaborate with Democrats on important issues for the benefit of the American people.\n“If we come together and stick to our principles, we can get a lot done, often working with the other side,” Schumer said. “Just in June and July, we passed 5 major bipartisan bills.”\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, sounded less conciliatory in Senate floor remarks on Monday: “Senate Republicans have spent two years working to check and balance reckless policies; it will be an outstanding thing for the country to have new reinforcements arriving on the other side of the Capitol.”\n“If Washington Democrats do not want to pivot to sanity and common sense… if they will not help us address the ways their policies are hurting families… they will encounter stiff resistance from the sizable Senate Republican Conference that half the country has elected to be their voice, to be their champions, to fight for them,” McConnell warned.\nThe fact that Republicans have clinched a slim majority in the House, and not a large one as many polls projected, also may impact the organization and power structure of the party.\n“You know that the Democrats have a very small majority right now (in the outgoing House). Its about five seats. Nancy Pelosi has done a fantastic job of holding them together,” Eberly said. “There is not the same degree of unity in the Republican Party caucus, and I think that a small majority creates a nightmare scenario for McCarthy.”\nHowever, McCarthy said he is confident that the Republican party can work together as a unit, and that even with a small majority, he has enough power to accomplish his agenda in the speaker’s chair.\n“They don’t hand the gavels out in small, medium, and large sizes,” McCarthy said.  Republicans certainly are not sounding discouraged by their small majority.\nIn a press conference Thursday, Rep. James Comer, R-Kentucky, and GOP colleagues announced plans to investigate Biden and his son Hunter’s business dealings.\n “We are trying to stay focused on if Joe Biden was directly involved with Hunter Biden’s business deals and if he was compromised,” Comer said.\nGlendening said that some Republicans in the Freedom Caucus, like Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Georgia, will use their new power in the majority to “try to do very explosive and damaging things.”\nMcCarthy, meanwhile, said he wants to investigate numerous issues, such as COVID-19 in Wuhan, China.\n“We want to know the origins of where COVID began, so it never happens again. Who funded it? How did it get there?” McCarthy said.\nAlso, some Republicans have threatened to impeach Biden. However, Eberly said there are strong divisions in the party, and a small majority could prevent this, and investigations, from happening.\n“Theres an appetite on that wing of the party to impeach by anything that they can think of, but it would take enough Republicans so that they can overcome the fact that theres at least a handful of folks who dont want to go down that road,” Eberly said.\nWhile most of Biden’s agenda may be stymied by the Democrats’ loss of House control, he can still use the Democratic Senate majority to confirm more judicial nominees, which has been a priority over the last two years.\n“Senate Democrats have been committed to restoring balance to the federal judiciary with professionally and personally diverse judges,” Schumer said last week. “With two more years of a Senate Democratic majority, we will build on our historic pace of judicial confirmations and ensure the federal bench better reflects the diversity of America.”\nWhile Democratic control was cemented with wins in Arizona and Nevada, it is still unclear whether their majority will consist of 50 or 51 senators. If Sen. Raphael Warnock, D-Georgia, defeats Republican Herschel Walker in the Georgia runoff on Dec. 6, Democrats would have 51.\nThe addition of one seat would make a huge difference because under Senate rules it would allow for a more streamlined confirmation process for nominees.\n“It will mean appointees and judges will get appointed much more quickly,” Schumer said Monday on MSNBC.\nFor his part, Biden struck a hopeful tone after the House was called for the GOP, saying in a statement on Wednesday that “I am ready to work with House Republicans to deliver results for working families.”  \n“In this election, voters spoke clearly about their concerns: the need to lower costs, protect the right to choose, and preserve our democracy,” the president said. “As I said last week, the future is too promising to be trapped in political warfare. The American people want us to get things done for them. They want us to focus on the issues that matter to them and on making their lives better. And I will work with anyone – Republican or Democrat – willing to work with me to deliver results for them.”"

    "title": "Library group: book titles targeted for banning tripled in 2021",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  The number of books people tried to ban from schools and libraries nearly tripled between 2019 and 2021, according to data from the American Library Association. \nThe ALA Office for Intellectual Freedom tracked 729 challenges to 1,597 separate book titles in 2021. That’s up from 377 challenges to 566 book titles in 2019. \n“Its a situation that Ive never witnessed in the two decades Ive worked for the Office for Intellectual Freedom and a real change in the nature of the demands to censor books,” said Deborah Caldwell-Stone, director of the organization.\nIn 2021, the ten most commonly banned books according to the ALA were Gender Queer, Lawn Boy, All Boys Arent Blue, Out of Darkness, The Hate U Give, The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian, Me and Earl and the Dying Girl, The Bluest Eye, This Book is Gay and Beyond Magenta.\nBook banning is not a new idea. In fact, Banned Books Week—which promotes book titles targeted over the decades—has been celebrated in libraries since 1982. \n  \nMost Banned Books By Year by Jonathan Hunter Donville\nBut the scope of efforts to ban books is new. Caldwell-Stone attributes the rise in book banning to advocacy groups calling for the removal of dozens of books at the same time. \n“I want to clarify that its entirely appropriate for a parent to raise a concern about a book their student is reading and have discussions about that with librarians or teachers and even making a choice that the book isnt the right book for their child or their student,” she said. \n“But what were seeing now is advocacy groups going to school boards and library boards with a list of 10, 25 or even 50 books, demanding their removal all at once, often based on claims that the books are either inappropriate because they reference LGBTQ persons, or reflect the lives and experiences of Black persons or persons of color.”\nGroups like Moms for Liberty and No Left Turn in Education have been vigorous advocates for book removal. The groups have ties to conservative groups and donors. \n“Unfortunately, what we have found is that there is obscene graphic sexual content in books that are located in public school libraries across the United States of America,” said Tiffany Justice, co-founder of Moms for Liberty.  \n“American parents are very concerned about the fact that their children have access to pornography in school, that its being done under the supervision of adults who are okay with children having access to pornography in schools, and so we have gotten involved to ensure that school districts follow the law because apparently they are unable to do that on their own,” she said.\nJustice declined to enumerate books Moms for Liberty disapproves of.\n“It wouldnt be appropriate for a national organization to put out a list because we dont want parents to think that every book is in every single library,” she said. “They need to go and do the work to find what books are in their libraries, and what books and what the laws and statutes are in their state.” \nPEN America, a nonprofit that says it works to celebrate and defend free expression, identified at least 50 organizations pushing for book removals across the country. \n[Book banning resonates as an issue in Maryland school board races]\n“Previously, you might have somebody objecting to a particular book because of a particular slur or offensive statement, or representation or content with something people don’t like, but now we have this mass list of books or people going to databases and looking up with any book that has any LGBTQ content, or any book that touches on the history or contemporary commentary about racism,” said Jonathan Friedman, director of free expression and education programs at PEN America. “Were seeing an escalation of book banning, culminating in something that is really different from the banning we saw even five years ago.”\nThe book challenges have been effective: According to data from Northeastern University, 15 states have passed legislation banning certain books in K-12 education, often on the grounds that they contain elements of critical race theory. An additional 16 states have proposed similar legislation.\n“Thats the distressing thing about this time,” Caldwell-Stone said. “Were seeing elected officials adopt the rhetoric that books dealing with race, racism and slavery are inappropriate for young people to read, or if they are available, can only reflect certain viewpoints—a certain view of history that the elected officials and the advocacy groups approve of. And were seeing elected officials also adopt the rhetoric that books dealing with gay, queer or transgender people are inappropriate for young people to read and demanding that such books be removed from schools and libraries.” \nPEN America found that about half of challenged books are intended for young adult readers, but they also include picture books intended for elementary schoolers. \nBooks like Heather Has Two Mommies, This Day in June — a picture book about Pride parades — and Anti-Racist Baby have all been challenged or banned. The organization also found that 41% of banned books “explicitly address LGBTQ+ themes or have protagonists or prominent secondary characters who are LGBTQ+.” \nJustice says that the idea that the book challenge fight is about LGBTQ issues is a lie.\n“Weve been very clear about saying that parents being concerned about pornography in schools whether its with heterosexual couples, homosexual couples, heterosexual children, homosexual children, their sexual orientation isnt the issue,” she said. “Its the pornography. Thats the issue and we need to be honest about that.”\nCaldwell-Stone worries about this trend from both a legal and moral standpoint.\n“Were talking about public institutions, government-funded institutions, engaged in telling young people and telling families and telling adults what they can read and think about, which is repugnant to the First Amendment,” she said. “But also, it’s a matter of addressing the dignity and humanity of others who live in society and their right to find their lives and experiences. reflected in the collections of a public library or school library that their taxes support as well.” \nFriedman agreed.\n“Its having an impact for students, teachers, writers, publishers and librarians, some of whom have been harassed or intimidated,” he said. “It’s highly concerning because if you start reducing the availability of books based on anything anyone might object to, youre very quickly going to run out of any kind of library or classroom book to have available to young people.”\nCaldwell-Stone said she anticipates the number of challenged books this year will be about the same or higher than last year.\n“The end result is that books that do reflect the diversity of society, that reflect the lives of persons who attend that school or part of the community and that the public library serves, are being told that they dont belong and that their stories dont belong,” she said. “And I think that is the ultimate tragedy here.”"

    "title": "Pelosi ends historic speakership but will stay in the House",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, one of the most powerful politicians in U.S. history and the first woman speaker, announced on the House floor midday Thursday that she would not seek another run for leadership in the Democratic Party.\n“I will not seek reelection to Democratic leadership in the next Congress,” Pelosi, dressed in white, said to a chamber packed with Democratic members, who broke her remarks with loud applause and standing ovations.\nPelosi recalled the first time she saw the United States Capitol: she was riding in the car with her brothers as a six-year-old girl going to the swearing-in ceremony of her father, Thomas D’Alesandro, Jr., who was representing Baltimore in the House. She called the Capitol a “stunning white building with a magnificent dome.”\nPelosi’s announcement came after the narrow loss of the House by the Democratic Party, in last week’s midterm elections. Republicans are projected to have at least 218 seats  the bare minimum for a majority.\n“Last week, the American people spoke, and their voices were raised in defense of liberty, of the rule of law and of democracy itself…And now we owe to the American people our very best, to deliver on their faith,” Pelosi said.\nAs an indicator of the polarization in the House, few Republicans came to the chamber to bid farewell to a Democrat that for many elections was a favored bete noir in GOP campaign commercials. Among those absent was the man who hopes to be the next speaker, fellow Californian Kevin McCarthy, whose bid so far has failed to find unanimity on his party caucus.\nA major figure in the legislative achievements of the Obama and Biden administrations, Pelosi said she would be retaining her House seat representing San Francisco.\n“For me the hour has come for a new generation to lead the Democratic caucus that I so deeply respect,” Pelosi said.\nPelosi, 82, has had a long career in political leadership.\n“When I first came to the floor at 6 years old, never would I have thought that some day I would go from homemaker to House speaker,” she said.\nPelosi rose to power as a California lawmaker who has represented the state’s 12th District for 35 years. In 2007 she became the first woman to be elected as the speaker of the House.\n“When I came to the Congress in 1987, there were 12 Democratic women. Now there are over 90. And we want more,” Pelosi said.\nDemocratic lawmakers hailed the speaker’s historic accomplishments after she announced she was giving a green light to the new era of leadership.\n“Shes taken a lot of weight and she has educated us and mentored us,” Rep, Jamie Raskin, D-Maryland, told reporters.\n“And so there are a lot of people who have benefited watching her… Shes a once-in-a-century kind of figure, but there are other great leaders here.”\nPelosi’s long-time colleague, 83-year old House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Maryland, also announced Thursday that he was stepping away from leadership but retaining his House seat.\n“I think it’s time,” Hoyer said in front of reporters on the steps of the Capitol. “I’m going to continue to be working on behalf of the Democratic Party and on behalf of the values that Nancy spoke of.” He added that he hopes for “success” from the new leadership.\n“To serve with her for four years as speaker has been the greatest reward of my life because she included us and she empowers us to be our best selves everyday,” said Rep. Ann McLane Kuster, D-New Hampshire.\nPresident Joe Biden said in a statement Pelosi was “the most consequential speakers of the House of Representatives in our history.”\n“Because of Nancy Pelosi, the lives of millions and millions of Americans are better, even in districts represented by Republicans who voted against her bills and too often vilify her,” the president said. “That’s Nancy – always working for the dignity of all of the people. And, as a fierce defender of democracy through our laws, history will also note her fierceness and resolve to protect our democracy from the violent, deadly insurrection of January 6th.”\nRep.-elect Glenn Ivey, D-Maryland, tweeted: “There’s never been a more effective Speaker in our nation’s history. Thank you Madam Speaker for your leadership and dedication to our country.”"

    "title": "So close to speakership, Hoyer to step away from leadership role, remain in House",
    "content": "WASHINGTON — House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer of Maryland, has decided to leave his position as the second-ranking Democrat  a post he has held in the minority and the majority since 2003  but will remain in the House.\nHoyer for years was considered a likely successor to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-California. But as she stepped away from her post Thursday, so too did Hoyer, part of a smoothly-engineered transition to younger party leadership.\nIn a letter to his fellow House Democrats on Thursday, Hoyer said: “Like my dear friend, John Lewis, I believe God’s work for us is to create that ‘beloved community’ for which John worked so consistently and courageously. I believe there is much for me still to do in pursuit of that endeavor. I believe that it is time for me, however, to continue my service in a different role.”\n“Now is the time for a new generation of leaders, and I am proud to offer my strong endorsement to Hakeem Jeffries for Democratic Leader,” said Hoyer, who is 83 years old.\nHakeem Jeffries has represented New York’s 8th District since 2013. He serves on the Budget Committee and Judiciary Committee.\nHe is 52 years old, much younger than the current leadership.\nRep. Bennie Thompson, D-Mississippi, who is the chairman of the Jan. 6 Select Committee, has worked with Hoyer in the House for almost 30 years and has valued his leadership.\nHe told Capital News Service that he’s relieved that there isn’t a “dog fight” as to who will lead the party next and that Democrats are making a smooth transition to younger members in leadership.\n“Im glad that we leave with an understanding that its time to pass the torch,” Thompson said.\nDemocrats lost control of the House in this election, so Jeffries would be serving as a minority leader  and the first Black party leader in American history  for the next two years. However, Hoyer thinks that Jeffries will be speaker after the next election cycle.\n“He is a skilled and capable leader who will help us win back the majority in 2024 as we strive to continue delivering on our promises to the American people,” Hoyer said.\nHoyer will still continue his work in the House serving Maryland’s 5th District.\n“I do intend to continue my service in Congress and return to the Appropriations Committee as a member to complete work in which I have been involved for many years, including my focus on education, health care, and investing in America’s productive manufacturing capacity to create more jobs and opportunities for our people,” Hoyer said in his letter.\nHe said he also thrives fighting for equality, especially focusing on voting rights and civil rights.\n“I have been honored to serve alongside Nancy Pelosi, whose tenure as Speaker was both historic and extraordinarily productive,” Hoyer said.\nPelosi and Hoyer will still play a significant role in the House, even though they are no longer in leadership, according to Thompson.\n“I know the next crop of leaders will weigh heavily on their experience and knowledge,” Thompson said.\nHoyer said he looks forward to providing his guidance to the next generation of Democratic leaders.\n“I am honored to serve with you, and I look forward to what we will surely accomplish together in the years ahead,” Hoyer said."

    "title": "House GOP lawmakers say they will probe Hunter Biden",
    "content": "WASHINGTON – Reps. James Comer of Kentucky, and Jim Jordan of Ohio on Thursday set the focus of the soon-to-be Republican-led House oversight and judiciary committees on an investigation of President Joe Biden and his family.\nAs the new 118th Congress takes shape and prepares to take office in January, the House will flip narrowly to Republican control, in turn giving the party the chairmanships of committees for the first time since the 115th Congress in 2019.\nComer is expected to chair the House Oversight and Reform Committee. Jordan likely will be chairman of the House Judiciary Committee. The pair, flanked by other Republican committee members, spoke at a press conference about the alleged international dealings of the president’s son Hunter Biden, and how they implicated the president.\n“This is an investigation of Joe Biden, the President of the United States, and why he lied to the American people about his knowledge and participation in his family’s international business schemes,” Comer said.\nA spokeswoman for the House Democrats on the committee, Nelly Decker, told CNN the GOP’s targeting of the Bidens was politically motivated.\n“Now that former President Trump is running for office again, House Republicans’ top priority is attacking President Biden and his family in a desperate attempt to return Mr. Trump to power,” Decker said.\nMore broadly, the future committee heads said they would make it a priority to investigate activities they consider overreaches by the federal government.\nJordan said the judiciary panel would target it deems to be political within the Justice Department, keying in on specific action that he said interfered with U.S. elections in the past.\nJordan alleged that the FBI spied on former President Donald Trump’s campaign in 2016 and went on to speculate that the bureau’s raid of Trump’s Mar-a-Lago residence in August was an attempt to influence the most recent election.\n“Maybe it’d be nice if the FBI and the Justice Department just stayed out of it and let we the people decide who we think should represent us, who we think should lead us?” Jordan asked rhetorically. “That’s supposed to be how America works.”\nOn the oversight side, Comer said the committee has obtained two Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) from banks that involved members of the Biden family. SARs are filed by financial institutions to report known or suspected violations of law, according to the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network.\n“We’re going to do a lot of investigations. We’re going to do a lot of probing,” Comer said. “We’re focused on waste, fraud and abuse and there’s no shortage of that in this federal government, let me assure you that.”\nRepublicans on the oversight panel published an interim staff report entitled “A President Compromised: The Biden Family Investigation,” a 31-page document that included screenshots of emails, SARs and articles that alleged corrupt dealings.\nMost of the evidence presented was allegedly obtained from Hunter’s laptop, which was said to be recovered from a Wilmington, Delaware, repair shop in 2020.\nA Justice Department investigation led by the U.S. attorney in Wilmington began in 2018 and remains open, but no charges have been brought against Hunter or the president thus far.\nNeither Comer nor Jordan responded when asked about the possibility of an attempt to impeach Biden in the House.\n“You’re going to be presented with something you haven’t been used to over the past four years: evidence,” Comer said."

    "title": "Senate moves ahead on bill to protect same-sex, interracial marriages",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  The Senate on Wednesday voted 62-37 to advance a bipartisan bill that would provide federal protection for same-sex and interracial marriage. Twelve Senate Republicans joined Democrats to advance the Respect for Marriage Act, which already passed by the House of Representatives by wide margins in July. “We are on the cusp of a historic vote in the Senate because of everybody’s efforts,” Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wisconsin, said. If passed, the measure would require the federal government to recognize same-sex and interracial marriages. This would include the repeal of the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) and would codify the Supreme Court’s rulings in Obergefell v. Hodges and Loving v. Virginia. Rep. Jerrod Nadler, D-New York, introduced the original version of the Respect for Marriage Act in 2009. The bill has been introduced five times, but only picked up momentum following the Supreme Court’s June ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health overturning Roe v. Wade, which established the right to abortion. In his concurrence with the Dobbs decision, Justice Clarence Thomas suggested the court should reconsider Obergefell. Multiple senators referenced Thomas’s suggestion in their floor speeches Wednesday, including Baldwin and Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio. Baldwin, the first openly gay woman elected to the Senate, called Thomas’s opinion an “open invitation to litigators across the country to bring their cases to the court, inevitably instilling fear among millions of Americans.” Lawmakers and marriage equality activists became concerned that the court could possibly overturn Obergefell and return the question of same-sex marriage to the states. Supporters of the bill are aiming to prevent this outcome by enshrining recognition of same-sex marriage in federal law. The 2022 version of the bill also includes protection for interracial marriages, which while protected under the Supreme Court’s ruling in Loving v. Virginia, is not codified in federal law. Maryland Sens. Ben Cardin and Chris Van Hollen, both Democrats, voted to invoke cloture on the motion to proceed with the bill. “It is long past time for Congress to make clear that equal rights are guaranteed across America, no matter who you love, who you marry, or where you live,” Van Hollen told Capital News Service. “The Respect for Marriage Act ensures that, no matter where in America they live, all married couples are afforded equal rights, freedom, and dignity.”Cardin said before the vote Wednesday that he was “optimistic” the Senate would pass the bill. “Today is going to be a great day for the United States Senate and the American people,” Cardin told CNS. “Were going to be able to protect the marriage equality in our country.”A Maryland law legalizing same-sex marriage went into effect in 2013. The state began recognizing same-sex marriages from other jurisdictions in 2012. Same-sex marriage became legal in Washington, D.C., in 2010. It has been legal in Virginia since 2014. Following bipartisan support in the House with a 267-157 vote  with 47 Republicans voting in support of the bill  the Respect for Marriage Act was delayed and negotiated for months before Wednesday. Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle used the time to work together to ensure enough senators would vote to pass the bill.Republican supporters of the bill highlighted an amendment to the act that recognized protection of religious liberties and clarified that the act would not allow polygamy. Portman called current federal law a “disconnect” from American opinions, as lawmakers pointed to polling that has shown more than 70% of Americans — including a majority of Republicans —support same-sex marriage. The Ohio senator said he recognized that “millions” of American couples are hoping for peace of mind about the permanent validity of their marriage.“We must not let them down,” Portman said."

    "title": "Citing 1835 treaty, Cherokee Nation appeals to House for a delegate",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  The Cherokee Nation called upon a House panel Wednesday to uphold the terms of a 187-year-old treaty and seat a delegate representing the tribe before the end of this year.\nThe House Rules Committee held a hearing with the Cherokee Nation’s Principal Chief Chuck Hoskin Jr. and legal experts to discuss the treaty’s implications and explore options for meeting that request.\n“Words alone dont absolve us of the horrific injustices brought on Native American communities at the hands of the US government, and that is why Im hopeful that todays historic hearing opens a new door towards building greater understanding and the possible inclusion of these communities in Congress,” said Rep. Jim McGovern, D-Massachusetts, and the committee’s chairman.\nIn 1835, the U.S. government and a minority portion of the Cherokee Nation East signed the Treaty of New Echota, agreeing that the Cherokee Nation would cede ancestral land in Georgia.\nWASHINGTON  Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Maryland, (right) talks to Mainon Schwartz, legislative attorney for the Congressional Research Service, after a House Rules Committee haring Wednesday on the possibility of seating a House delegate representing the Cherokee Nation. To Raskins right is Rep. Mary Gay Scanlon, D-Pennsylvania. (Destiny Herbers/Capital News Service)\nIn return, the treaty includes a provision, Article 7, that the Cherokee “shall be entitled to a delegate in the House of Representatives,” said Mainon Schwartz, legislative attorney for the Congressional Research Service.\nThe treaty was ratified by the Senate and eventually became the legal basis for the violent, forcible removal of the Cherokee people known as the Trail of Tears.\n“The history since 1835, with the Cherokee Nation, has been one of rebuilding and then being suppressed again, being oppressed again, being dispossessed,” Hoskin told lawmakers. “We seem to be in rebuilding mode for the last few centuries.”\nNow, Hoskin said, the Cherokee Nation is finally in a position where it can assert its right to representation.\nAfter nearly 200 years with the other portion of the treaty unfulfilled, the Cherokee Nation appointed its first delegate to the House of Representatives, Kimberly Teehee, in 2019.\nTeehee would be a non-voting delegate, similar to delegates from U.S. territories, able to serve on and vote in committees, but not empowered to vote on the floor.\nThe distinction between member and delegate is important because it means the Cherokee people would not be double-represented by a House member representing their district and the Cherokee delegate in substantive votes, said Lindsay Robertson, professor of Native American Law at the University of Oklahoma.\nThe committee is considering two options for seating Teehee: a resolution to amend the standing House rules or separate legislation that would need to pass the House and Senate and be signed by the president.\nBecause standing rules need to be reaffirmed every two years, a resolution would not create a permanent position, Schwartz said, but passing a bill would address that issue.\nIf the United States decides to honor the treaty’s promise after two centuries, Hoskin said, it would be “breathtaking” for a future Congress to break that promise.\nOther tribes and Cherokee bands have sent letters to the committee requesting delegates, McGovern said, prompting concerns from House members.\nThe language of the New Echota treaty is the clearest legally, Schwartz said, and there are rulings declaring the Cherokee Nation as successor to the original treaty.\n“We need to look into everything, but needing to look into everything doesn’t mean we have to wait on taking action on something that is pretty clear,” said Rep. Tom Cole, R-Oklahoma, and the ranking member of the committee.\nThe House can both pass a resolution to seat Teehee now, and work on long-term legislation that might address the appeals of other tribes, McGovern said.\n“I dont think we should be very patient in the face of this (incoming) Congress,” said Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Maryland. “And I think we should act with dispatch to make this happen. I think there are some final things we’ve got to figure out, but we should move as quickly as possible.”"

    "title": "Memorial to Native American veterans dedicated in Washington",
    "content": "WASHINGTON — Raindrops ceased and a rainbow stretched over the horizon Friday afternoon as speakers honored Native American veterans with the dedication of a memorial in Washington.\nThe National Native American Veterans Memorial was dedicated on the National Mall on Veterans Day, exactly two years after the memorial first opened.\n“How humbled and grateful we are that this national day of recognition has finally come full circle to honor our Native American warriors, past and present,” Kiowa leader Robert Short said in an invocation.\nWASHINGTON -National Native American Veterans Memorial was dedicated Friday afternoon, on Veterans Day. (Grace Yarrow/Capital News Service)\nNative American participation in the military is higher than any other group in the United States — almost 19% of Native Americans have served since 9/11, according to the United Service Organizations (USO), higher than the 14% average among other ethnic groups.\nBefore the memorial dedication ceremony, Native American veterans from almost 125 tribes and communities took part in a procession.\nThe dedication marked the start of a weekend of events honoring Native American veterans and celebrating the memorial’s dedication. Events planned for Saturday and Sunday include music and cultural performances, film screenings, panels and crafts.\nA permanent testament to the service of Native Americans in the military, the memorial is a tall stainless steel circle lifted over a stone drum. Around that is a round space designed to encourage visitors to gather and reflect just outside the Smithsonian National Museum of the American Indian.\nVisitors can tie prayer cloths onto four lances placed around the perimeter of the area. Incorporated into the memorial is a speaker playing a loop of thirteen different veteran songs from various tribes.\nA group of judges selected the design of Harvey Pratt, a veteran and member of the Cheyenne and Arapaho Tribes of Oklahoma, out of over 120 artists’ submissions in 2017.\n“Without warriors, we may not be here. This memorial is about warriors of the past, warriors of today and warriors of tomorrow,” Pratt said before lighting a fire in the center of the memorial’s circle as part of the ceremony.\nThe memorial is the first to highlight the sacrifices of Native American veterans on a national scale and is the first memorial ever to be constructed on Smithsonian grounds.\nCongress in 2013 authorized the National Museum of the American Indian to create the memorial to honor Native Americans in all branches of the military.\nWASHINGTON -Lonnie Bunch, secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, speaks before a crowd at the dedication of the National Native American Veterans Memorial on the National Mall Friday. (Grace Yarrow/Capital News Service)\nSen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, and Rep. Sharice Davids, D-Kansas, along with Secretary of Veterans Affairs Denis McDonough, spoke at the dedication, sharing their appreciation for indigenous veterans.\n“I know I often get asked: why choose to serve a country that has mistreated tribes for generations?” said Davids, a member of the Ho-Chunk Nation and daughter of a veteran. “Its because they choose patriotism. Its because they choose love of this country and these lands.”\nCynthia Chavez Lamar, director of the National Museum of the American Indian, wiped tears from her face as she thanked attendees for their sacrifices.\n“The museum is proud to be the home of the memorial,” Lamar said. “And well carry out our responsibility to forever welcome and honor veterans and educate people about the extraordinary military service of Native veterans and active duty service members.”"

    "title": "Glenn Ivey enters the House determined to prevent democracy from crumbling",
    "content": "WASHINGTON — Glenn Ivey enters his first term as a congressman after a landslide victory against Republican challenger Jeff Warner. Ivey will represent Maryland’s 4th District, a predominantly Black constituency, which contains parts of Prince George’s County and Anne Arundel County.\nThis was not Ivey’s first time running for the House. He ran in 2012 but dropped out before the primaries due to fundraising issues. He tried again in 2016 but lost in the Democratic primary.\nIvey said he wanted to make a difference in so many communities and now his perseverance has been rewarded.\n“There are major challenges that are being addressed one way or another in Congress, and I certainly want to be part of trying to help address those problems and find positive ways to move the country forward,” Ivey said in an interview with Capital News Service on Friday.\nHe will succeed Rep. Anthony Brown, who was elected Maryland’s first Black attorney general on Tuesday.\nIvey got to know many of his constituents as the state’s attorney for Prince George’s County. He served in that position for two terms from 2003 to 2011.\n“We had some successful prosecutions that I think led us to have good overall feedback from the community,” Ivey said.\nIn that role, he prioritized issues like reducing homicides and violent crime in general, domestic violence awareness and reading programs.\nIvey was also the chairman of the Maryland Public Service Commission, a regulatory agency that ensures safe, reliable, and economic public utility and transportation services.\nHe said he hopes to be assigned to the House Judiciary Committee due to his extensive legal experience, including serving as the Democratic counsel to the Senate Whitewater Committee and working with former Rep. John Conyers Jr., when the Michigan Democrat was a member of the Judiciary Committee.\n“I think the background is really there for Judiciary Committee-related matters that deal with the courts,” Ivey said.\nGoing into his term, one of Ivey’s top priorities is protecting democracy and the right to vote. He said he is frustrated with politicians refusing to concede when they lose an election.\n“I would call it the crybaby politics of election deniers,” Ivey said. “We want to get back to the days where if you lost, you help with the transition, so incoming officials can focus on the business of governing and getting the work done for the people.”\nHe is also passionate about enacting gun control legislation, especially to protect children in schools from mass shootings.\n“I get that people want to protect their Second Amendment rights, but we’ve got to protect second graders as well,” Ivey said.\nHe said he also aims to work on the top issue for many voters in this election: the economy. He wants to help address inflation but not raise interest rates so much that it will harm Americans.\n“We dont want to put the country into a recession,”  Ivey said.\nIt is still unclear which party will win control of the House with votes still coming in from key states like Arizona, Nevada and California. The final tally will determine whether Ivey and his Democratic colleagues can move their policy agenda forward.\n“Hopefully, well win the majority, and well be able to continue building on all of the things that got done in the last few years,” Ivey said."

    "title": "Days after the midterms, Biden reinforces climate pledges at global summit",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  Days after the midterm elections, President Joe Biden on Friday reiterated American promises to stay in the fight against climate change and said the United States would reach its pollution reduction targets by 2030.\nBiden spoke at the United Nations global climate summit, known as COP27, being held in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, through Nov.18.\nAt the climate summit,  leaders of developing nations have been discussing the role the industrialized countries play in causing climate change and who should be paying to help the poorer countries offset the damage.\n“The United States of America will meet our mission targets by 2030,” said Biden, pledging the country’s commitment and leadership to help the world fight the consequences of climate change. He said that the United States “will do our part to avert a climate hell.”\n“And the sum total of the actions my administration is taking puts the United States on track to achieve our Paris Agreement goal of reducing emissions 50 to 52 percent below  2005 levels by 2030,” the president said.\nBiden’s engagement with climate change has marked a sharp reversal from the policies of his predecessor, President Donald Trump, who doubted the role carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuels play in raising the planet’s temperatures. He also withdrew the United States from the Paris climate agreement, a step Biden canceled on his first day in office.\nIn his speech in Egypt, Biden focused on U.S. accomplishments and goals such as the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, bipartisan legislation passed by Congress and signed into law by the president last summer, calling it the “biggest, most important climate bill in the history of our country.”\nBiden also renewed a promise to provide $11.4 billion to the international climate aid every year by 2024, which would likely meet challenges if Republicans gain control of the House after Tuesday’s midterms elections, and has not been fully funded.\nThe Congress has only appropriated $1 billion for climate change assistance for 2022. The initiative would help developing countries transition to clean energy sources and adjust to the realities of climate change.\n“Here in Egypt,” Biden said, “the Great Pyramids and the ancient artifacts stand as testament to millennia of human ingenuity. We see our mission to avert climate catastrophe and seize a new clean energy economy not only as an imperative for our present and future, but through the eyes of history.”\nBiden attended the climate summit alongside other administration officials, including climate envoy John Kerry, as well as Democratic lawmakers led by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-California.\nPelosi also promoted the Inflation Reduction Act in front of the COP27 delegates on Friday.\n“We know there is much more that needs to be done, but what we have accomplished with the Inflation Reduction Act was something that has never been done before in our country or in any other country,” Pelosi said.\nThe legislation was aimed at targeting various sectors of the economy, including the goals to reduce carbon emissions by 40% by 2030. The measure included a $370 billion package of incentives for investments in energy security and climate change.\nPelosi said that the U.S. government has received positive feedback on the Inflation Reduction Act from leaders around the world.\n“And there was a recognition that the Inflation Reduction Act has made a significant difference and will make a significant difference,” she said.\nMaryland Sen. Ben Cardin, a Democrat who is on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, said on Thursday in a press conference that the Democrats were not conceding anything yet. He spoke from the COP27 alongside Democratic Sens. Edward Markey of Massachusetts and Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island.\n“Politics in Washington is always challenging when it comes to any appropriation bill and I dont think thats going to change very much with the next Congress,” Cardin said.\nWhitehouse said there is a “strong bipartisan interest” in supporting the transitioning economies and supporting the International funds, but opposition would likely come from the Republicans.\n“Republican leadership, if you use the word ‘climate,’ they seem to be a guest. And we really need to work together to see whether they act responsibly,” Whitehouse said. “The Republican opposition is driven by the fossil fuel industry.”\nMarkey stressed that the United States needs to continue to fight against climate change regardless of the consequences of the elections, and should play its part in combatting the devastating consequences of climate change around the world.\n“We hear Pakistan, we hear Bangladesh…We hear all these countries, and they are right. We have to do much more,” Markey said. “This is an absolutely imminent threat to countries around the world, the United States has to be the leader.”"

    "title": "Justices considering extent of federal power to protect wetlands",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  The Supreme Court is currently deciding a case which may determine the future of wetlands around the Chesapeake Bay and across the country.\nOn Oct. 3, the Supreme Court heard arguments in Sackett v. EPA. The case stems from a seemingly parochial concern: a family in Idaho was cited for filling in wetlands on its property without a permit. However, the implications of this case are far-reaching and potentially dangerous, according to environmental groups like the Chesapeake Bay Foundation.\nLawyers for the Sackett family are contending that under the Clean Water Act, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) only has authority to regulate “navigable” waters, that is, permanent waterways that a boat or ship could pass through, not wetlands, seasonal streams or other bodies of water not directly linked to the sea. \nIf the justices were to accept the Sacketts’ argument, the EPA would be hamstrung in regulating large swaths of the wetlands in the United States, especially on the Delmarva peninsula. The US Forest Service estimates that the peninsula is home to as many as 17,000 “Delmarva bays,” also known as “whale wallows,” which are small, oval-shaped indentations covering some 34,560 acres of the peninsula, according to the Chesapeake Bay Foundation.\nIn addition to providing habitats for many plants and animals, wetlands act like sponges absorbing storm surge and flood waters. The protection to coastal communities provided by wetlands is increasingly important as sea levels rise and extreme weather events become more frequent. \nWetlands also catch and filter runoff from farmlands, parking lots and roads, keeping pollution out of Maryland streams, rivers and ultimately the Chesapeake Bay. \nThe Chesapeake Bay Foundation filed an amicus brief supporting the EPA’s interpretation of the Clean Water Act and Jon Mueller, the Chesapeake Bay Foundation’s vice president for litigation called the Sacketts’ position “extreme.” \n“When you look at the purpose of the (Clean Water) Act, which is to protect water quality and restore it where need be, then you cannot assume that Congress meant that only the permanent bodies of flowing water that you can float a boat on are going to be covered,” Mueller told Capital News Service. “There are just too many other waters that are very important to our natural resources, but also to human health to allow that to happen.”\nIn oral arguments, most of the justices seemed skeptical of the Sacketts’ sweeping argument. Justice Brett Kavanaugh repeatedly questioned why the court should break with 45 years of precedent, which has stated that a wetland covered under the Clean Water Act can be separated from a navigable body of water.\n“This case is going to be important for wetlands throughout the country and we have to get it right,” Kavanaugh said. “So why wouldn’t a wetland separated by a berm, dune, levee or dike be covered, contrary to what the past 45 years of precedent have suggested?”\nConversely, the justices also seemed to want to balance environmental protection with providing better clarity for homeowners who may have a difficult time discerning what is and is not a protected wetland. \nMueller, while concerned about the implications of the case, maintains a positive outlook towards an eventual ruling: “I think the court has its work cut out for it, but I’m kind of optimistic that we aren’t going to end up with an extremist view when the ruling is put forth.” \nIt should be noted that there are state laws on the books in Maryland and Virginia that would still protect wetlands in the region if the Supreme Court rules against the EPA. However, regulation across the region would become a patchwork. \nDelaware would be at greater risk because it follows federal guidance on the definition of covered waters. According to the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, Delaware has 30,000 acres of isolated wetlands, including Delmarva bays, that are threatened with destruction. \nNotably, this is the second time the Sacketts have argued before the Supreme Court over the same 2007 incident in which they were cited by the EPA for improperly filling in wetlands on their property. \nIn 2012, the Supreme Court issued a unanimous decision in favor of the Sacketts. The ruling stated that EPA orders are subject to civil challenge under the Administrative Procedure Act."

    "title": "NASA details new experiments headed for the space station",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  SpaceX’s 26th commercial resupply mission, targeted to launch to the International Space Station on Nov. 18, will feature several new experiments and technology to advance the health of astronauts, NASA announced in a media preview Wednesday.\n“The ISS is an amazing multi-disciplinary lab offering unique access to long duration microgravity and the low-Earth orbit. Each CRS mission brings a wealth of new research to the station,” said Kirt Costello, NASA’s chief scientist for the International Space Station Program Research Office.\nThe mission will launch on the Dragon spacecraft and Falcon 9 rocket from the launch complex at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, said Josh Finch, a NASA communications official.\nCIPHER Vestibular Health\nCIPHER’s vestibular health study will test the newly launching Falcon Goggles, a tool for examining how an astronaut’s balance adapts in space, said study leader Timothy Macaulay.\nThe goggles will use unobtrusive cameras to track eye movements to understand how spaceflight impacts the astronauts’ eye health and balance over time.\nExperiments will test eye and head movement while the astronauts actively move themselves in set patterns and while an astronaut is passively moved by another crew member.\n“We know that there are significant vestibular and sensorimotor adaptations during spaceflight, especially around gravity transitions, like when first going to space and when landing back on Earth,” Macaulay said.\nThis process can cause astronauts to experience motion sickness and deficits in both perceptual and motor functions, which are normal adaptations but they may happen quicker and become more severe during longer missions.\n“(The changes) can impact astronauts’ abilities to perform critical mission tasks during future deep-space exploration,” Macaulay said.\nThe team is working to develop counter measures to help astronauts in flight and post-flight, specifically for long-term space missions, by adapting existing vestibular treatments used to help patients with balance on the ground.\nVeg-05\nNASA’s space crop production team’s Veg-05 study will grow three tomato harvests for the spring of next year, testing new growing technologies, said Gioia Massa, the study’s principal investigator.\n“Plants are a nutritious, palatable food source that we can grow for the crew during spaceflight and this has the potential to promote health, provide bioavailable nutrients, enhance the dietary experience and reduce things like menu fatigue,” Massa said.\nThe study will look at psychological impacts of having plants on board and growing and caring for them. The astronauts will also be surveyed for their moods after consuming fresh produce.\n“The crew members, after they eat the fruit, will be asked to rate the flavor, the texture, the juiciness of the produce grown under the different light treatments,” Massa said.\nCrew members will grow Red Robin tomato seeds in NASA’s Veggie plant growth unit using plant pillows, which have coarse clay to trap the water and air into the root zone of the plants.\nThe plants will be fed with slow-release, polymer-coated fertilizer, and exposed to LED lights with different levels of blue and red, Massa said, to learn about the impact of lighting on plant growth in space.\nLooking forward, the teams are developing larger crop production hardware for future plant experiments for the Moon.\n“Tomatoes are going to be a great crop for the Moon. They’re very nutritious, they’re very delicious, and we think the astronauts will be really excited to grow them there,” Massa said.\nMoon Microscope\nThe Moon Microscope technology is a portable test kit for in-flight medical diagnosis, said Mayra Nelman-Gonzalez, immunologist in NASA’s Johnson Space Center’s Immunology and Virology Laboratory.\nThe kit includes a portable, handheld microscope that connects wirelessly to any smart device with Wi-Fi, and materials to pull and image blood samples on board.\n“Although we don’t have a profound clinical problem on the space station, crew members do experience changes in their immune systems,” Nelman-Gonzalez said. “So when we go for deep space missions, the stressors increase and our ability to care for the crew is reduced, and that combination really increases certain clinical risks.”\nMoon Microscope technology has the potential to be used in hard-to-reach areas on Earth as well, Nelman-Gonzalez said. A layman can perform the blood smear and stain from the field, and send the image to doctors for analysis.\n“Any sample that can be placed on a slide, we can image… as long as there are small particles, not necessarily a giant rock,” Nelman-Gonzalez said.\nBioNutrients-2\nThe BioNutrients-2 experiment will test new preservation methods for microbes and organisms in space conditions, explained John A. Hogan, chief of the bioengineering branch at NASA’s Ames Research Center.\n“Biomanufacturing may end up being an important component of future long-duration missions that involve human habitats on the Moon, and especially Mars, because they allow us to make the products there rather than bring them there,” Hogan said.\nFor long-term space missions to other planets, food and medical supplies need to have a stable shelf life of at least five years to be considered a reliable supply.\n“Studies have shown that the shelf life of certain vitamins, nutrients and pharmaceuticals is currently too short for these long missions,” Hogan said.\nOver six months, crew members will be testing a new, lightweight bag system to store and grow microbes in the microgravity on the space station. These results will be used to support the development of a future three-year experiment to engineer a nutrient-dense yeast strain.\nThe team is exploring ways to produce fermented milk products like yogurt and kefir on board a spaceflight using shelf-stable powdered milk, which could provide probiotics, nutrients, and medicinal products to crew members.\n“Our team is also working to find efficient ways to use local resources like carbon dioxide to make the media that’s needed to enable large scale biomanufacturing,” Hogan said.\niROSA \nNASA will be launching two new, rollout solar arrays on the space station called iROSAs, aimed at increasing the space station’s onboard power capacity, said Matt Mickle, Boeing’s developmental projects senior manager.\nThe first two iROSAs were launched last year and have been performing “extremely well,” Mickle said, each providing about 10 kilowatts of power generation capacity.\nThe new solar arrays will be installed by crew members over two spacewalks, planned for Nov. 28 and Dec. 1.\n“With a successful installation, that means we’ll be about halfway through our upgrade of the legacy solar system that’s been on orbit for over 20 years,” Mickle said."

    "title": "Maryland results: Van Hollen wins second term, one US House race may surprise",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Maryland, won a bid for a second term on Tuesday, easily defeating Republican challenger Chris Chaffee.\nMost Maryland Democrats won the House races they were expected to win. The exception could be Rep. David Trone, who on Wednesday was trailing Republican challenger Neil Parrott in the 6th District, which stretches from Montgomery County into western Maryland.\nThe state has a new member of Congress in Democrat Glenn Ivey, representing Maryland’s 4th District.\nThe Associated Press has called all of Maryland’s congressional races but the Trone-Parrott race. In 2020, Trone beat his opponent by about 20 points but in a district that was dramatically changed in subsequent redistricting. So if he were to lose this race, that would indicate a huge shift in his district, in part due to redistricting.\nHere’s a post-election day guide to results in the Senate contest and all of the U.S. House races in Maryland.\nU.S. Senate\nAfter defeating Chaffee, Van Hollen said in a statement Tuesday that he was “honored to be elected alongside a historic ticket of Maryland state leaders including Wes Moore, Aruna Miller, Anthony Brown, and Brooke Lierman as well as federal Team Maryland.”\nThe senator said he will continue to focus on issues such as “protecting a woman’s right to reproductive freedom” and “preserving our democracy and protecting the right to vote.”\n\nVan Hollen has held the seat since 2017. Before that, he represented Marylands 8th Congressional District from 2002 to 2017. He has helped other Democrats campaigns as well as chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee from 2007 to 2011 and Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee from 2017-2019.\nChaffee ran for the Senate in 2016 and 2018 but lost in the Republican primaries both times.\nVan Hollen raised $6.4 million and spent $5.4 million from January 2021 to October 2022, and Chaffee has not reported any fundraising activity, according to records filed with the Federal Election Commission.\nMaryland’s 1st District\nRepublican incumbent Andy Harris beat Democrat Heather Mizeur.\nHarris has held this seat since 2011, and before that, he was a member of the Maryland State Senate from 1998 to 2010. He also served as a physician in the U.S. Naval Reserves. He is currently the only Republican U.S. House member in the state, but that would change if Parrott wins his race.\nMizeur was a member of the Maryland House of Delegates, representing District 20, from 2007 to 2015. She ran for governor in 2014 but lost in the Democratic primary to Anthony Brown.\n\nShe is currently the founder and CEO of Soul Force Politics, a non-profit organization dedicated to “bridging the worsening divisions in American politics and civic life,” according to her campaign website.\nThe Libertarian candidate in the district race, Daniel Thibeault, is a utilities worker from Elkton, Maryland.\nFrom January 2021 to October 2022, Harris raised and spent around $1.9 million and Mizeur raised $2.6 million and spent $2.2 million. Thibeault has not reported any fundraising activity, according to the FEC. Mizeur raised significantly more than the last Democratic candidate who tried to unseat Harris.\nMaryland’s 2nd District \nDemocratic incumbent Dutch Ruppersberger, who has been in his seat since 2003, held off Republican challenger Nicolee Ambrose.\nRuppersberger won his last three elections by about 30 points. Prior to representing Maryland’s 2nd District, he served Baltimore as Marylands assistant state attorney on the Baltimore City Council and as Baltimore County Executive.\nAmbrose has served as the national committeewoman for the Republican Party of Maryland since 2012. She is also the president  CEO of The Ambrose Group, LLC, which provides government and communications consulting services.\nFrom January 2021 to October 2022, Ruppersberger raised and spent about $1 million. Ambrose raised around $441,000 and spent around $359,000 in roughly the same period, FEC records show.\nMaryland’s 3rd District\nIncumbent Democratic Rep. John Sarbanes won his race against Republican Yuripzy Morgan.\nSarbanes has held the seat since 2007 and has won every election with comfortable margins.\nMorgan, a lawyer and former conservative radio show host, ran unsuccessfully in the 2016 Republican primary for the 2nd Congressional District seat.\nAccording to the FEC, Sarbanes raised about $179,839 and spent about $660,788 from January 2021 to October 2022, while Morgan raised about $431,523 and spent about $388,343 in the same period.\nMaryland’s 4th District\nDemocrat Ivey beat Republican Jeff Warner.\nIvey was the state’s attorney for Prince George’s County from 2003 to 2011. He ran in the 2012 primary for the district but withdrew from the race due to fundraising issues. Again, he ran in the 2016 primary race but lost.\n“I am deeply honored to be the Congressman-Elect for Maryland’s 4th Congressional District,” Ivey said on his Twitter page. “Today, the work continues, and I can’t wait to get to Congress and fight for you.”\nWarner, a pastor, was making his first bid for Congress.\nIvey raised about $1.8 million and spent about $1.6 million from October 2021 to October 2022. Warner raised about $55,192 and spent about $38,935 from March 2021 to October 2022, according to the FEC.\nThere was no incumbent running in the 4th District. Anthony Brown, who has held the seat since 2017, announced in October of last year that he would run for attorney general and was elected Maryland’s first Black attorney general on Tuesday.\nMaryland’s 5th District\n\nDemocratic House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer defeated Republican candidate Chris Palombi.\nHoyer has served in this district since 1981. He was the House majority leader from 2007 to 2011 and returned to the position in 2019.\n“I thank the voters of Maryland’s Fifth District for entrusting me once again with the responsibility of serving as their voice in the House of Representatives,” Hoyer said on Twitter. “Together, we will ensure families in #MD05 have the tools they need to Make It In America.”\nPalombi, a former United States Capitol Police officer, had never previously run for Congress.\nFEC records show that Hoyer raised about $3.7 million and spent about $3.6 million and Palombi raised about $61,291 and spent about $61,251 from January 2021 to October 2022.\nMaryland’s 6th District\nA winner in Maryland’s 6th District was unclear Wednesday according to the Associated Press.\nIncumbent Trone beat Parrott in 2020 by a nearly 20-point margin. However, the election was made more competitive and unpredictable this year by redistricting.\nTrone was first elected to the House in 2018. He is the co-founder and co-owner of Total Wine  More, a chain that is now the largest independent alcohol retailer in the country.\nTrone’s campaign raised over $13 million, mostly his own money, and spent $8.2 million as of Oct. 19, according to the FEC.\nParrott has represented Maryland’s District 2A in the House of Delegates since 2011. He previously worked as an engineer and is the owner of Traffic Solutions, Inc., a transportation firm in Hagerstown.\nParrott raised $795,686 and spent $449,294 as of Oct. 19, his campaign reported to the FEC.\n“Tens of thousands of ballots are still outstanding, and it may take a few days for every vote to be counted. But Im confident that Im headed back to Congress to keep fighting for the people of the 6th District,” Trone tweeted after midnight on Wednesday.\nMaryland’s 7th District\nDemocratic incumbent Rep. Kweisi Mfume easily defeated Republican Scott M. Collier.\nMfume served in the House from 1987 to 1996 and ran again in the 2020 special election following the death of Rep. Elijah Cummings.\nMfume was a member of the Baltimore City Council from 1978 to 1986 and is the former president and CEO of the NAACP.\nMfume raised $487,525 and spent $262,052 as of Oct. 19, his campaign reported to the FEC.\nCollier has run for office three times since 2014. He is the founder of DundalkTV and the Global Brain Injury Association, according to his campaign website.\nThe FEC has no information on Collier’s campaign funds. Collier’s website states that he has never accepted donations for any of his campaigns.\nMaryland’s 8th District\nIncumbent Rep. Jamie Raskin, a Democrat, was swept to a fourth term, defeating Republican Gregory Coll and Libertarian Kevin Andrés Garcia.\nFrom 2007 to 2016, Raskin was a Maryland state senator. Raskin has risen to national prominence as a member of the Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol\nAs of Oct. 19, Raskin raised $4.4 million in this campaign cycle and spent $2.6 million, according to FEC reports.\nRaskin tweeted late Tuesday night after the AP called the race to thank voters.\n“My gratitude to the people of Maryland’s beautiful 8th District for your support and unyielding commitment to democracy, freedom and social progress. I am honored and excited to serve you once again in the people’s House,” Raskin said.\nColl currently works in the aerospace-defense field, according to his campaign website. His campaign raised $13,619 for the 2022 election and spent $13,728 as of Oct. 19, according to the FEC.\nLibertarian candidate Andrés Garcia worked in the software industry prior to his run for the House. The FEC has no reports on Garcia’s campaign funds."

    "title": "Democracy&#8217;s future worries some voters",
    "content": "UPPER MARLBORO, Md.  Maryland voters participating in the first major election since the Jan. 6 insurrection are expressing concerns about the state of American democracy, but what Democrats and Republicans worry about differs significantly. \n“I do believe that democracy is at stake. I think we’re going down the wrong road and I think we’re going to continue going down that wrong road, perhaps during my lifetime. I hate to think of it,” said Mary Ann Bailey, a 79-year-old retired school administrator from Upper Marlboro. Although she voted for Democrats across the ballot this year, she said she had split her votes across party lines in past elections.\nBailey is not alone. \nAn August 31 Quinnipiac University poll found that 67% of Americans are concerned that the nation’s democracy is at risk of collapse, which is a nine-point jump from January 2020. \nThat concern is shared equally among Democrats and Republicans, although they may have different ideas about what constitutes threats to democracy. In the poll, both 69% of Republicans and 69% of Democrats worried that democracy is in danger of collapse. \nDemocrats and Republicans may share a general concern about the state of democracy, but they find different reasons to worry, said Pippa Norris, a comparative political scientist at Harvard University. \n“Republicans say its about fraud, and those who are voting illegally, and those who are Democrats, its about political oppression, suppression, and particularly minorities will have problems getting registered or getting to vote, said Norris.\nThomas McKenzie, a 62-year-old contractor and plumber from Upper Marlboro, expressed concerns about the integrity of the 2020 presidential election, although investigations have found no evidence of large-scale voter fraud. He voted for Republicans across the ballot Tuesday. \n“The last election was clearly stolen, everybody knows it. But it’s just deny, deny, deny,” McKenzie said. \nBeyond election concerns, McKenzie pointed to the First Amendment as an element of democracy under fire. \n“Interfering with free speech can pretty much put an end to (democracy). And It’s been interfered with quite a bit,” McKenzie said. \nIn Rockville, Maryland, Edgardo Malaga’s concerns contrasted with McKenzie’s.\n“Our country is facing one of the most difficult crises in its history, ”Malaga said. “Womens rights are being taken away, we’re no longer a country that believes in facts, the amount of misinformation being disseminated is concerning and startling. People should be paying attention because its dangerous.”\nIf American democracy is in danger, it’s not alone.\nExperts from organizations like Freedom House, a nonprofit that researches democracy, civil liberties and political rights around the world, have been sounding the alarm about a rise in attacks on democratic institutions around the world for the past decade. Freedom House’s most recent “Freedom in the World” report found that in 2021, a total of 60 countries suffered a decline in democracy; only 25 countries improved.\nNorris said that there are cracks beneath the surface of countries that have been democratic for a long time, including the United States. She said the problems with democracy are often in a country’s norms and institutions, things like the “media, freedom of the press and of expression, political rights and questions about the independence of the judiciary.”\n“Often the reason for (democratic erosion) is a disjuncture, a lack of congruence between democratic cultures and democratic institutions,” she said. “The U.S. has always had somewhat weak institutions in the sense that we have constitutional rigidity. Its very, very difficult to amend the Constitution in accordance with changing times.”\nMost constitutions last for about 17 years on average; the U.S. Constitution is over 230 years old. \n“If theres a problem, for example, about the role of the president or the way in which we have run elections or any other sorts of powers of the legislature, other countries have often gone through some periodic reviews to improve and update their constitution, but the ways in which the United States has been much more rigid than others involves requiring both a two-thirds majority in the House and the Senate, and then the two-thirds majority in the states,” Norris said. \nBecause the Constitution is so difficult to amend, U.S. institutions are reliant on informal democratic norms, like the idea that politicians most of the time compromise with the intent of coming to an agreement. \nNorris said this approach used to work, when political parties served as umbrella organizations that brought in a wide coalition of people and interests. But increased political polarization has eroded that norm.\nIsaac Alex, an 81-year-old contractor from Upper Marlboro, is a registered Republican who voted for Democrat Joe Biden in the presidential election because Trump “talked too much trash.”\n“When the Republicans are in power, I can get money to borrow,” he said. “I can go to a bank and have a loan. When the Democrats were in power, all hell broke loose. That’s the way I look at (the midterm elections).” \nAlex also thinks “democracy is very jittery right now, because we don’t know where we’re going. The economy is not good, even though there’s jobs.”\nNorris said increased political polarization is a growing concern.\n“Party polarization in a two-party system is extremely problematic, particularly when you cant change the rules of the game,” she said.\nDespite some of what Norris calls red blinking warning lights, voter confidence remains relatively high, according to Lisa Bryant, a professor of political science at California State University, Fresno. Most people  around 85%  think their vote was likely counted correctly. \n“At the local and state level, (voter confidence) is still pretty high,” said Bryant. “We dont really see sort of a significant change until you get to thinking about all votes nationwide being counted correctly. And even then, the majority (64%) of people say that they think that they were counted correctly.”\nBryant said voter confidence dipped in both the 2016 and 2020 elections.\nIn 2016, “Trump had a lot of rhetoric around sort of individual voter fraud that undocumented people were filling out ballots or people were duplicating votes,” she said. “Hillary Clinton talked about election fraud in a very different way. She talked about election tampering, and most of the time thinking about external forces, like the Russians, trying to tap into our election systems and change election results or make the equipment malfunction. Both of those things can contribute to seeing a decline in voter confidence.”\n“I’m worried sick,” said Bailey. “The hatred, the violence, the lack of respect. The way people at the top instigate. I could go on and on about our former president.”\nIn 2020, voter confidence dipped again particularly among Republicans because of the “Big Lie,” which speaks to rampant voter fraud and the idea that the 2020 election was stolen, Bryant said. Nonetheless, she remains confident that elections are functioning as they should. \n“I think our elections will be fine,” she said. “I think the results are solid. I think were running better elections than we ever have before, especially because theyre under scrutiny and theyre under a very watchful, suspicious eye. That means the clerks have made things more transparent. Theyve made better documentation of everything that happens. So they can show exactly what they do.”\nThe problem, Bryant said, is getting people to believe in the integrity of elections.\n“If people want to believe that theres foul play, they might just automatically discount or discredit the evidence you show them that there wasnt,” she said. “So I think thats actually where the biggest threat to our democratic system, to our republic lies, is that people have really just moved away from believing anything.”\nNorris said although normal public policy debate is to be expected, the level of threat to democracy today goes beyond that.\n“When you cant agree on the basic rules of the game, and you dont know how to reform them, and the institutions dont allow you to reform them, thats when youre heading for trouble,” she said. “And sometimes it seems to me that America is rather like the Titanic heading for the iceberg. We can see the iceberg, and it wont hit in 2022. But gradually, the risks just get much, much greater as we approach 2024.”"

    "title": "National Guard, federal security agencies on watch against election interference",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  To thwart election interference, National Guardsmen trained in cybersecurity are on standby to provide ballot-security assistance to 14 states.\nOfficials told reporters on Friday that the guard is working with the U.S. Cyber Command, the Cybersecurity  Infrastructure Security Agency and federal and local law enforcement to detect and prevent election interference.\nAccording to assistant adjutant general and commander of the Washington National Guard, Brig. Gen. Gent Welsh, involving the military in election security makes sense. \n“You don’t train people and corporations and the state public sectors to do this kind of work,” he said at a press conference. \n“Most of the security is built around making sure the walls are higher and the lights are blinking green,” he said. The guard however, is trained “to do cyber missions against other military structures.” \nArmy Gen. Paul Nakasone, commander of the U.S. Cyber Command and director of the National Security Agency, issued an Election Day statement saying “vigilance – today and every day – isn’t just a watchword, it’s a matter of democracy.”\n“Americans can rest assured: thousands of your fellow citizens stand ready to defend your vote, every single day,” he said. \nThe Army and Air National Guard’s 38 cyber operations units are staffed by over 2,200 personnel, while the guard has an additional 2,240 people to provide support. \nThe 14 states are Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Iowa, Illinois, Louisiana, North Carolina, New Mexico, New York, Pennsylvania, Washington, and West Virginia, according to Defense One. \nThis is not the guard’s first time assisting states with elections. In the May primaries, the guard assisted eight states with election cybersecurity.\nAlthough reticent about discussing specific operational threats, Maj. Gen. Todd Hunt, adjutant general of the North Carolina National Guard, said his state’s guardsmen have conducted over 45 cybersecurity missions this year. He said requests for assistance may include cyber help against ransomware, malware or credential harvesting.\nHunt also said the North Carolina Guard has provided preemptive cyber hygiene training and network education for many of the state’s 100 counties. He called the guard a “touch point between federal and local agencies when it comes to cyber.”\nWelsh agreed, speaking to the vertical flow of communication up and down the chain of state and federal cybersecurity. \n“You actually have folks in uniform, folks with security clearances that can pass data both up to Cyber Command in a very quick way… and in some cases, some of the highest levels of security information (can be passed) down to a state that can be fingered through as appropriate,” Welsh said. \nSince Russia’s 2016 operations to obstruct U.S. elections, the Department of Defense has increasingly focused on interagency partnership to undermine foreign interference. \nThe declassified 2017 Intelligence Community Assessment, a joint report on Russian election involvement, found that Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered operations aimed at increasing then-presidential candidate Donald Trump’s election chances. \nThe report found that although the Kremlin directed a complex campaign of covert and overt cyber and messaging strategies, the systems used for tallying U.S. votes remained unaffected.\nMeanwhile, the Cybersecurity  Infrastructure Security Agency notes on its web page that “while important commonalities exist across and within states, each state, local, and territorial election jurisdiction administers its elections under a unique legal and procedural framework using varying systems and infrastructure.” \n“The differences and complexity introduced by this decentralization can lead to uncertainty in the minds of voters; uncertainty that can be exploited by malicious actors,” the agency said.\nTo combat misinformation, the agency maintains an election security fact-checking page at https://www.cisa.gov/rumorcontrol."

    "title": "In a city of museums, Washington adds another one",
    "content": "WASHINGTON – In Washington’s newest art museum, natural light streams in through arched windows and the songs of Marvin Gaye fill the air as visitors scrutinize the works of artists like Keith Haring, whose series of 20 paintings were inspired by Gaye’s groundbreaking music.\nThe Rubell Museum is a unique addition to the art scene in the nation’s capital and features contemporary pieces from the personal collection of the Rubells, a multigenerational family of art enthusiasts. The museum opened on Oct. 29.\nThe museum, located on I Street in Southwest Washington, is housed in what once was a historically-Black public school where singer Marvin Gaye was a student, Randall Junior High School. In fact, the museum’s first exhibition, “What’s Going On,” is an homage to Gaye and his music.\nAt the museum’s entrance, visitors are greeted by a modern glass addition to the former school. The concrete stairs are adorned with mums and a coffee pop-up sits atop an adjoining porch. The museum is situated in a fast-developing neighborhood near the Washington Navy Yard, Nationals Park and Audi Field, home to Major League Soccer’s D.C. United.\nPast the entrance, the space opens into a grand hall  read high school auditorium  featuring four large-scale pieces bathed in sunlight. One of the works is a massive pandemic-themed fabric tapestry by New York artist Christopher Myers.\nThe former auditorium also hosts a sprawling piece by Kehinde Wiley, famous for his portraits of Barack and Michelle Obama. The piece is a modern reimagining of 18th century French artist Jean-Bernard Restout’s painting, “Sleep.”\nThe sheer size of the 32,000-foot museum allows for viewers to comfortably wander among the exhibits. In the basement, exposed brick walls and raw concrete flooring set the scene for works carefully placed to give visitors a sense of participation and room to explore art with darker tones.\nThroughout, works reflect themes of social and political issues, with artists tackling subjects like racial violence, capitalism, environmental destruction and the exploitation of bodies and sexuality.\nThe different rooms of the museum host a variety of pieces, from golden ruins to a covered wagon with a roof woven of state flags and an interior resembling the night sky by artist Matthew Day Jackson.\nA series of paintings and sculptures on the third floor are texturally linked by fuzz.\nKeith Haring’s series of 20 paintings, highlighted prominently in the current exhibit, depict the artist’s worries about oppression, destruction and illness, which he created while constantly listening to “What’s Going On.” The series was dedicated to Don Rubell’s brother, Steve, who died from AIDS in 1989 at 45.\nMera and Don Rubell began collecting art shortly after they got married in 1964. Their son, Jason, began his collection in 1982. Since then, the family has built a reputation for supporting contemporary art; the Rubells opened a museum in Miami in 2019.\n“The museum’s historic setting in a place of learning invites the public to explore what artists can teach us about the world we live in and the issues with which we are wrestling as individuals and as a society,” Mera Rubell said in a statement about the Washington museum.\nAdmission to the Rubell is free for D.C. residents, but the cost of entry rises to $15 for anyone living outside of the District."

    "title": "Hurricane Ian aftermath underscores flood risk to Maryland coastal areas",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  As Florida residents and officials face difficult infrastructure repairs and billions of dollars in damage to property following Hurricane Ian, Marylanders are left to wonder if they could face a similar disaster sometime in the future.\nMaryland is at significant risk of flooding in future years, according to Climate Central, a communications group focused on climate issues. Among all 50 states, Maryland has the seventh-most acres below projected flood levels by 2050.\nIn 2022 alone, Maryland landowners have received nearly $8 million in National Flood Insurance Program payments, economic aid overseen by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. That’s the fifth-highest total in the United States, trailing only Washington, Alabama, Florida and Texas.\n\nThe future flooding risks have implications for future development along Maryland’s 7,719 miles of shoreline, environmental groups say.\n“Continuing to build new infrastructure and communities in the most vulnerable places without additional protections is certainly a large concern,” Laura Brush, a fellow at for the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions, a leading nonpartisan climate policy group, told Capital News Service. “Not only for the people and businesses that live there, but for the local economies more broadly.”\nFor urban areas, Brush said greenspaces, including parks and street trees, would be the easiest and most obvious solutions to prevent localized flooding and runoff.\n\nClimate change is the obvious factor looming over coastal flooding, and many of these solutions to mitigate flooding risks also work toward curbing rising temperatures, she noted.\nBrush said that on a national scale, Miami has generally done the best job of comprehensive infrastructure to reduce the impact of damaging floods.\n“In some areas, the communities that are most at risk are leading the way because they’re already seeing the biggest impacts, and they perhaps are projected to see the biggest impacts moving forward as climate change worsens and creates more extreme weather,” Brush said.\nFor rural landowners who can’t give up on their homes, the solutions are more individual.\nIn Maryland, Dorchester and Somerset Counties face the biggest risks. The data from Climate Central projects that the flood levels will get higher and higher in coming years, putting more and more property at risk.\nJennifer Starr, coordinator of the Local Government Advisory Committee of the Chesapeake Bay Program, said that the organization committee has shifted its focus to address the flooding risks in recent years.\n“(Marylanders) are dealing with that local challenge of flooding, sea level rise and ground subsidence on the Eastern Shore,” Starr said. “So you’re losing land over time.”\nStarr said that while water quality can seem like the main issue for the Chesapeake Bay, the quantity of water should be considered just as important.\n“Flooding does have an impact on quality, because you’re getting ag farm runoff just due to these severe intensive rain storms, inches of rain in a really short time period,” Starr said. “The quantity of water is having an impact on the quality of water.”\nThe financial implications of more intense weather events are even being recognized by federal agencies.\nThe Department of Treasury’s Federal Insurance Office is launching a data collection initiative to assess how climate change is impacting insurance companies across the nation.\nResults of the survey would compare current and historic underwriting data on homeowners’ insurance, according to the department.\n“The recent impacts in Florida from Hurricane Ian demonstrate the critical nature of this work and the need for an increased understanding of insurance market vulnerabilities in the United States,” said Secretary of the Treasury Janet Yellen said in a statement. “FIO’s data collection will add to the work of regulators and policymakers across the administration to assess climate-related risks to the financial system, the U.S. economy, and the American people.”\nThe results of the data collection, broken down by zip code, will be used to make more informed decisions in areas most prone to the effects of climate change.\n“It’s really important that all this new funding that’s coming from the federal government for infrastructure or for resilience specifically really supports projects that are built to last,” Brush said."

    "content": "WASHINGTON  Producing crab meat isn’t just a profitable industry in Maryland  it’s an art. \nThat art, mastered by seafood processors along the Maryland shore, is threatened by a lack of workers, according to Jack Brooks, president of the Chesapeake Bay Seafood Industries Association.\n“Were food manufacturers. You know, we were declared essential during the pandemic, provided we had staffing, but its very, very difficult to operate like this,” said Brooks, who is also the co-owner of J.M. Clayton Seafood Company.\nFor years, Brooks said, employers in the seafood industry have struggled to obtain enough H-2B visas  temporary nonagricultural worker permits  to properly staff crab and seafood businesses. \nLast month, Maryland Sens. Ben Cardin and Chris Van Hollen, both Democrats, announced a visa program for the 2023 fiscal year that aims to temporarily aid the staffing shortage. \nThe Department of Homeland Security will provide 130,716 H-2B visas in the 2023 fiscal year, made up of 66,000 that are annually released and 64,716 additional visas. Cardin and Van Hollen said in a statement that they are seeking a permanent solution to the lack of visas in the H-2B program. \n“The success of our small seafood businesses – and the strength of our Shore economy – depends on their ability to hire enough workers for crabbing season,” Van Hollen said in a statement to CNS. “This year the H-2B process is better than it has been previously, but it is certainly not a long-term solution.”\nThe move to add more visas comes after Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, a Republican, urged lawmakers to find a solution to the limitations of the H-2B visa cap. \n“Maryland’s seafood industry is part of what makes us known around the nation and the world. We cannot  and I will not  let these hardworking Maryland businesses fail on our watch,” Hogan said in a Feb. 15 letter to Maryland lawmakers.\nAt the start of the crab-picking season, seafood processors are awarded H-2B visas through a lottery system, competing with other industries for temporary workers. \nNine out of 10 crab processors said that challenges in labor availability threatened the survival of seafood businesses, according to a project conducted by the Chesapeake Bay Seafood Industry Association and supported by the Maryland Department of Agriculture. Many of the processors also said the current lottery system creates uncertainty and hurts the industry.\n“We need a long term fix,” Brooks said. “The release of the supplemental visas sounds really good but it wont come anywhere near satisfying the demand.”"

    "title": "Some scientists fear emerging COVID variants, but CDC sees no reason for alarm",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  Some researchers and medical professionals are worried about newly discovered Omicron subvariants potentially causing one of the most dangerous waves of the pandemic yet. But public health agencies, like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), aren’t sounding any alarms.\nThe differences underscore the all-too-familiar problem of mixed messaging when it comes to COVID-19. \nContrary to popular belief, and the downward trend of cases in the country at the moment, many health officials agree that the pandemic is not over. \nOmicron, a highly mutable variant of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, is one of five “variants of concern” recognized by the World Health Organization (WHO). It currently dominates the over 97 million recorded COVID infections in the U.S. as of Nov. 2, according to a CDC tracker. \nBut as more variants emerge, even the simplest of terms like “concern” or “fast-spreading” appear to be vastly misinterpreted.\nDuring Omicron’s peak midway through the summer, a Daily Beast article called subvariant BA.5 “the most dangerous one yet,” quoting health experts.\nIn other reports online, including Forbes articles and Twitter threads, many have continued to draw attention to the subvariants’ potential threat, claiming U.S. officials have not properly prepared the country for the advent of newer Omicron spawns, like XBB, BQ.1 and BQ.1.1. \nWASHINGTON  A package containing COVID booster medicine. (Maxine Friedman/Capital News Service)\n“I dont think its a panicking time,” said David Wentworth, chief of the Virology, Surveillance and Diagnosis Branch of the CDC’s Influenza Division. “We do have variants that are emerging, but they are sublineages of the Omicron umbrella. So, theyre all antigenically related to each other.”\nAntigenic, Wentworth said, means that even if the names are different, the protein spikes could look similar. \n“They have a similarity that your immune system recognizes,” Wentworth said. \nThe XBB subvariant, a hybrid of two Omicron strains, however, has been called an evolving threat by Fortune magazine due to its ability to “escape immunity” in certain cases. \nIn August, international public health agencies released statements about the increasing cases of Omicron subvariants, such as XBB. \nThe CDC encouraged people to get vaccinated in September but continues to leave out XBB data from its Nowcast due to the small percentage or infrequency of the subvariant in the country, according to their website. \nSimilarly, wastewater surveillance found traces of BQ.1 and BQ.1.1 in the United States in early September, following prior communications from the WHO Regional Office for Europe. As of Oct. 29, the CDC’s Nowcast, which the agency says “enables timely public health action,” shows BQ.1 and BQ1.1 accounts for 14% and 13.1% of cases, respectively, in this country.\nHowever, this information is new to most people, Dr. Eric Feigl-Ding, an epidemiologist and co-founder of a nonprofit public health organization, the World Health Network (WHN), told Capital News Service. \nFeigl-Ding and some other health experts on Twitter have called out the CDC in the past few weeks for “purposely” withholding information about these “deadly” variants from the agency’s Nowcast up until recently. He said the CDC is now having to “backfill” data, leaving many to question the CDC’s ability to prepare the country for another wave.\nBut Wentworth disputed that characterization. \n“We have nothing to hide,” Wentworth said in an interview with CNS. He added that the CDC’s rule is to input variants of concern only after they’ve accounted for at least 1% of cases. \nThe Nowcast page also says that it takes two to three weeks to update it, as the agency has to aggregate all of the wastewater surveillance data.    \nThat bothers Brian Castrucci, president and CEO of the de Beaumont Foundation, a private foundation focused on improving the publics health. He has worked toward bridging the gap between the scientific community and the public. He is also a father of two, a heart attack survivor, a diabetic and a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patient. \n“I look at the (COVID) messaging as that person, and I dont even know what to do,” Castrucci said. “What’s the truth?” \nThe CDC and other public health organizations are not denying that there may be another spike in cases. In fact, the CDC has even noted on its website that breakthroughs are possible. \nOn the same web page, however, the CDC says the Omicron variant has proven to cause “less severe illness and death,” unlike the Delta variant. \n“If you can’t communicate logistics, then it makes it very hard to act on,” Castrucci said.\nWith the updated vaccines, also called bivalent boosters, in addition to the preliminary vaccines and boosters, the CDC said people have a greater chance of warding off a COVID-19 infection. \n“They can help restore protection that has waned since previous vaccination and were designed to provide broader protection against newer variants,” CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said in a statement on Sept. 1. “This recommendation followed a comprehensive scientific evaluation and robust scientific discussion. If you are eligible, there is no bad time to get your COVID-19 booster and I strongly encourage you to receive it.”\nStill, with anti-vaccine sentiments and vaccine hesitancy posted on social media, it’s harder than ever for health agencies, like the CDC, to reach the public.\n“It’s not that we have people who are anti-science,” Castrucci said. “It’s that people are now finding scientists who agree with them.”\nIn July, Texas doctor Mary Talley Bowden was suspended from Twitter after the social media platform said she posted “misleading and potentially harmful information related to COVID-19.” \n“127 deaths reported to VAERS in children 6 months to 17 years. Pull them off the market. #StoptheShots,” she said.\nAccording to an article by investigative reporter Emily Miller, Bowden has treated over 4,000 COVID-19 patients and has told over 120,000 of her Twitter followers to not get vaccinated.\n“If you dont think that this is still a big problem, and its not that serious, youre going to be attracted to that stream of information,” said Cynthia Baur, director of the Horowitz Center for Health Literacy at the University of Maryland School of Public Health. \nOn Oct. 12, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced the approval for anyone over the age of five to get the Moderna and Pfizer bivalent boosters. \nThe Maryland Department of Health told Capital News Service on Oct. 19 that the vaccines and boosters are “available widely in the state,” and that they will make Marylanders “COVIDReady.”\nThe following day, the state’s Department of Health sent out an automated text message to over 2 million people, saying that more than 522,000 Maryland residents have already received the bivalent booster shot. \n“Dont miss out on the holidays and schedule your booster today by visiting covidvax.maryland.gov,” the message said. \nOverall, nearly 23 million Americans have received the updated booster as of Oct. 27 since the vaccine’s initial distribution, which is a slower pace than in the first couple of months after the original mononuclear vaccine doses came out.\nThe public is not really familiar with the medical terminology, Castrucci said.\n“Bivalence? What does that even mean?” he said. \nSearches for the meaning of bivalent vaccines on Google.com have spiked dramatically.\n“And then also within our own ranks of medicine and public health, you have people speaking out against vaccination, making the scientific community seem to be imperiled in their own perception of the safety of the vaccine,” Castrucci said.\nOn Oct. 17, White House COVID-19 Response Coordinator Dr. Ashish Jha and federal public health officials met with leading health organizations to discuss ways they are managing and communicating information about the pandemic, especially as cases of influenza begin to surge. \n“Administration officials called on the organizations to ensure their members are doing everything they can to get Americans their updated COVID-19 vaccine and flu shots this fall, including through individual patient counseling, as well as phone calls, emails, and text reminders to patients,” a White House statement said.\nPresident Joe Biden also delivered remarks on Oct. 25 on the status of the country’s fight against COVID — a stark contrast from where he thought the country was just one month ago when he claimed in a “60 Minutes” interview that the pandemic was over.\n“We still have hundreds of people dying each day from COVID in this country — hundreds. That number is likely to rise this winter,” Biden said. “But this year is different from the past. This year, nearly every death is preventable.”\nThe president also provided information about the frequency of the updated booster shots. \nWhile more high-risk people, such as those who are immunocompromised or elderly, may need to get more than one shot, most Americans, he said, will only need one each year.\nCastrucci said its important that the public health community finds a way to agree on “clear, consistent messaging” as the pandemic continues. \n“If you cant trust anyone,” Castrucci said, “you will fall for anything.”"

    "title": "NASA to roll out Artemis I for Nov. 14 launch on Moon mission",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  NASA’s Artemis I test flight spacecraft is set to roll out onto launchpad 39B on Friday ahead of the targeted Nov. 14 launch date, despite a possible incoming storm system, NASA announced in a media briefing on Thursday.\nThe launch was previously delayed by Hurricane Ian in late September, NASA communications official Rachel Kraft said. The Orion spacecraft had to be moved back into the Vehicle Assembly Building at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida due to the storm.\n“Since rolling back to the VAB for Hurricane Ian, the team has been hard at work, work has gone smoothly, and we’ve been able to protect the rocket from the hurricane,” said Cliff Lanham, senior vehicle operations manager of the Exploration Ground Systems Program.\nThe Artemis I test flight is an uncrewed mission that will travel beyond the Moon and back to Earth to test propulsion and controls on the Space Launch System rocket and the next-generation Orion crew module.\n“There’s challenges that come with this complex of a vehicle, and where we’re flying, and how we’re getting there,” Jim Free, associate administrator of the Exploration Systems Development Mission Directorate, said.\nMeteorologists at NASA are monitoring the development of an area of low pressure near Puerto Rico that will slowly move toward Florida over the weekend, potentially impacting the Artemis I mission.\n“There’s still a lot of inconsistencies on exactly where that may end up, and whether or not it does acquire significant tropical characteristics to even become a named storm,” Mark Burger, launch weather meteorologist, said.\nNASA officials told reporters on a media call that they had decided to move forward with the rollout Thursday night, after assessing the storm’s possible impact on the rocket.\nThe team anticipates the highest impacts from the system on Monday and into Tuesday, which may include rain squalls with wind gusts of 35-40 knots, but those conditions would be well within NASA’s limits for the spacecraft’s exposure to weather, Burger said.\n“We’re confident in the decision process that went into that, we talked about a lot of the same things we talked about with the hurricane,” Free said. “Certainly the wind force is not the same and the duration is not the same… so our engineering team said it was an okay risk to go out tonight.”\nNASAs Nov. 14 launch has a liftoff planned in a 69-minute window that begins at 12:07 a.m. EST that day, Kraft said.\nThere are two backup dates in the November launch window, Free said: Nov. 16 at 1:04 a.m. and Nov. 19 at 1:45 a.m.\nTeams have a preference for launching in the daylight, but it is not a requirement, Free said.\nDaylight launch options are restricted through the end of the year because the Federal Aviation Administration regulates holiday air space.\nThe downside of night time launches, Free said, is a loss of visuals, but the “big fire shooting out the back” of the rocket will help light up the launchpad.\n“Everybody asks, ‘Are you confident in going after a launch attempt?’ If we weren’t confident, we wouldn’t roll out. If we weren’t confident, we wouldn’t start the countdown when we do. So yeah, we’re confident moving forward,” Free said.\nThe Artemis I mission will send the unmanned Orion and a service module provided by the European Space Agency out to the Moon and into an orbit about 60 miles above the Moon’s service. The spacecraft will orbit the Moon for weeks, then return to Earth.\nThe mission is slated to cover more than 1 million miles, with splashdown in the Pacific Ocean set for Dec. 9.\nThe Artemis I will be the opening of a series of space flights aimed at eventually establishing a long-term presence at the Moon."

    "title": "US, Russia discussing how to improve services at American embassy in Moscow",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  Despite tensions over Russia’s invasion in Ukraine and possible escalation, the State Department and the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs are discussing how to address the restrictions that prevent the American Embassy in Moscow from issuing visas.\n“As Under Secretary for Political Affairs Victoria Nuland stated recently, we want to make it easier for Russians to obtain U.S. visas in Moscow, but that requires action by the Russian government that would allow us to do so,” a State Department spokesperson told Capital News Service. \nThe measures would require the U.S. Embassy in Moscow to add more personnel. The embassy is currently limited to issuing only a small amount of official and diplomatic visas. \nThe U.S. Embassy in Moscow, the Russian embassy here in Washingtonboth remain operational, of course. It has not been without challenges, State Department spokesman Ned Price said during a press briefing Tuesday. The Russians, we believe, had imposed onerous restrictions.\nPrice added: “The viability of our embassy in Moscow is of the utmost importance to us principally because we will believe that even in times of tension…especially in times of conflict, its vitally important that well be able to communicate openly with one another in the U.S. Embassy in Moscow, the Russian embassy here in Washington.” \nWASHINGTON  The State Department and the Russian Foreign Ministry are discussing how to address restrictions that have hampered the processing of visas at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow. (Ekaterina Pechenkina/Capital News Service)\nThe Russian Embassy in Washington did not respond to a request for comment.\nPrice said he did not expect the embassy issue to be raised at the G20 summit in Bali, Indonesia, later this month mainly because I don’t expect that there will be discussions between the United States and Russia in the context of the G20.\nIn May 2021, the Russian government issued a ban on employing foreign nationals by the U.S. Embassy and designated the United States as an “unfriendly” country. \n“That ruling reduced staffing by more than 85% in our consular section,” the State Department’s spokesperson said. “These cuts greatly affected our operations, impeded our ability to provide visa services to the Russian public, and constrained our ability to engage with the Russian government and the Russian people.” \nThe State Department is interested in keeping the lines of communication open and engaging in diplomatic dialogue on a number of issues, including but not limited to the consular affairs and issues of Americans who are unlawfully detained in Russia.\n“At the height of the Cold War there were exchanges between Russians and Americans and it was important,  said Dr. Robert W. Orttung, research professor of international affairs at George Washington University. \nHe said the reason for that was to make sure that the Russian society got an accurate picture of American intentions and goals, and in return, that Americans had a real understanding of how things worked inside of Russia.\n“Today it seems much worse than it was back in those times,” he said. \nOver the years the United States and Russia made considerable efforts to develop relationships among the academics of both countries, according to Orttung.\n“So I think its important to try and preserve those connections even though condemning the Russian aggression in Ukraine,” he said.\nThe current diplomatic relationship corresponds with the state of the real relationship between the United States and Russia, which has deteriorated since Russian President Vladimir Putins attack on Ukraine. \nElizabeth Rood, the deputy chief of mission in the U.S. Embassy in Moscow, assumed duties as chargé d’affaires after John Sullivan’s departure in September. He served three years in the post but stepped down and announced his retirement after his wife died."

    "title": "In death penalty case, justices hear arguments over when a precedent is a precedent",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  The Supreme Court heard oral arguments Tuesday about an Arizona procedural rule that prevented a man from challenging the death sentence imposed on him for murdering a police officer. \nIn 2005, John Montenegro Cruz was convicted of first-degree murder for killing a Tucson police officer in 2003 and received the death sentence. \nCruz argued that the trial judge repeatedly denied him the right to inform the jury that if he received a life sentence, he would be ineligible for parole. Essentially, he received the death sentence because jurors thought that if he got a life sentence, he would be let out on parole. \nThe Supreme Court ruled in 1994 in Simmons v. South Carolina that if a defendant who could receive a life sentence is ineligible for parole, the jury must be notified of that fact. The justices said that rule should be applied in cases where the “defendant’s future dangerousness” is discussed, which applied to Cruz.\nHowever, the Arizona Supreme Court in 2008 affirmed Cruz’s conviction and ruled Simmons did not apply to Arizona because the state’s sentencing law is substantially different from sentencing guidelines in other states.\nJustice Elena Kagan said she found Arizona’s dismissal of Simmons disrespectful to the Supreme Court.\n“It sounds like youre thumbing your nose at us,” Kagan said.\nThe Supreme Court in 2016 overturned the Arizona Supreme Court decision in Lynch v. Arizona, saying that its ruling in the 1994 case had always applied to Arizona.\nCruz’s attorneys petitioned for post-conviction relief, arguing this ruling formally implemented Simmons in Arizona law, “a significant change in the law” that “would probably overturn (his) conviction or sentence.” Under Arizona criminal procedure rules this is one of the stipulations needed for a defendant to petition for post-conviction relief.\nThe Arizona Supreme Court affirmed the trial court’s denial of the petition, ruling that Lynch did not present a significant change in the law, just a change in the application of the law, so Cruz did not have standing to petition for post-conviction relief.\nThat reasoning met with apparent skepticism among many of the Supreme Court justices. \nJustice Ketanji Brown Jackson asked why Lynch did not present a significant change in the law if previous court decisions were overturned and were considered a significant change. Chief Deputy Attorney General Joseph Kanefield kept repeating that this was a unique case.  \nKagan questioned why Arizona argued that before 2016, Simmons didn’t apply to the state, so it didn’t have to give Cruz those rights in his trial, but Arizona also argued that the earlier ruling has always applied, but it’s not a significant change in the law that warrants post-conviction relief. \nKagan said Arizona can’t have it both ways: “Whatever you say, you win.” \nJustice Samuel Alito emphasized Arizona’s distinction between a change in law and an application of the law and how it applied in the Cruz case, but Justice Amy Coney Barrett argued this distinction was just “splitting hairs.”\nDeputy Solicitor General Eric Feigin agreed with Jackson, Kagan and Barrett.\n“It is striking that they still have not explained why they are so resistant to giving Cruz his Simmons rights, rights that they now say he was always entitled to,” Feigin said.\nArizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich told reporters after the oral arguments that the justices focused on the wrong issues in the case and that the state does not owe Cruz relief.\n“Post-conviction relief procedures aren’t even something this state has to offer. Arizona in some ways is being punished by affording defendants additional opportunities to make their case,” Brnovich said. \nAndrew Case, senior counsel for LatinoJustice, told Capital News Service that part of the reason Cruz was even given the death penalty in the first place was racial bias.\n“Studies show that jurors as a whole will be more susceptible to being convinced that a Black and Latino defendant will pose a future danger than a white defendant,” Case said.\nCase also hopes this case brings attention to the death penalty in general and helps end this “gruesome and horrific process.”\nBrnovich disagreed, telling reporters that the individuals on death row deserve to be there because they are guilty and “have committed heinous crimes” and Cruz is no exception.\nThe Supreme Court will likely release its decision in mid-June."

    "title": "Supreme Court considers future of affirmative action at colleges and universities",
    "content": "WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court heard arguments Monday in two cases which may determine the fate of affirmative action in American higher education.\nHarvard University and the University of North Carolina (UNC) defended their use of race as a factor in determining college admissions, in separate cases heard by the justices. Lower courts have previously ruled in favor of both Harvard and UNC. \nStudents for Fair Admissions (SFFA), a group created by conservative activist Edward Blum, is bringing both cases before the court. SFFA argued that considering race in college admissions violates the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. \nIn both cases, SFFA is seeking to overturn the court’s earlier ruling in Grutter v. Bollinger in 2003, which upheld the right of schools to consider race in their admissions processes with the goal of creating more diverse student bodies. The Grutter ruling also encouraged schools to pursue race-neutral admissions tests. \nThe universities argued that race is never a deciding factor in admission, but is a component in a holistic admissions profile, which takes into account diversity factors such as socioeconomic background, geography and language, among other things.  \nJustice Sonia Sotomayor agreed and questioned how it was possible for the plaintiff to argue race was a deciding factor when it was always considered along with other factors. \nSFFA attorney Patrick Strawbridge argued that the use of race as a criteria for admission was unconstitutional and disadvantaged groups like whites and Asian Americans. \nThe majority opinion in Grutter v. Bollinger, authored by then-Justice Sandra Day O’Connor, included the line, “We expect that 25 years from now, the use of racial preferences will no longer be necessary to further the interest approved today. \nThe justices, especially Justice Brett Kavanaugh, questioned the attorneys on whether this figure was to be taken literally and if the use of race would not end 25 years from Grutter, then when would it? \nEarly in the arguments, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson took aim at SFFA’s standing in the case, questioning what injury members of that group suffered by UNC’s race-conscious admissions system. \nThe court’s conservative justices seemed inclined to accept SFFA’s argument that race was not a necessary criteria for increasing diversity on college campuses and that more could be shown through an applicant’s personal essay, which could reveal elements of a personal struggle in the face of discrimination or cultural differences. \nJustice Elena Kagan slapped back at a hypothetical posed by Justice Samuel Alito about an African student who had moved to rural North Carolina and faced no discrimination but instead cultural differences, saying: “The race is part of the culture and the culture is part of the race, isn’t it? That’s slicing the baloney awfully thin.”\nIn its brief, Harvard noted that 41.5% of universities and 60% of selective universities (those admitting fewer than 40% of applicants) used race as a factor in admissions with the goal of creating more diverse student bodies. \nThe challenges to affirmative actions come on the heels of arguments in a redistricting case out of Alabama, in which the plaintiffs also urged the court to adopt a race-blind application of the Constitution. \nMany analysts see the court’s conservative supermajority as likely to overturn the precedent established in Grutter v. Bollinger. \nOver 90 amicus briefs were filed ahead of the arguments, with 60 of those backing the universities and 33 supporting Students for Fair Admissions. Groups supporting Harvard and UNC included the Biden administration, the College Board, ACT Inc., and the NAACP Legal Defense Fund. \nU.S. Solicitor General Elizabeth B. Prelogar also argued on the side of the universities. The Justice Department contended that removing race as an admissions factor would ultimately have an adverse effect on national security as it would be detrimental to the quality of officers graduating from the service schools and nationwide R.O.T.C. programs. \nThe judicial theory of originalism made several appearances during oral arguments. \nWhile typically associated with conservatism, the respondents argued that race-conscious policy making was part of the original intent of both the 14th Amendment and Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. Conservative Justice Amy Coney Barrett seemed to concede that an originalist reading of these texts would support the argument for affirmative action.\nOther conservatives on the court weren’t as persuaded. \nJustice Clarence Thomas seemed to repeatedly question the value of diversity in education writ large and cited his own experience as a student in elite institutions when they were much less diverse.\nJackson, who just recently joined the court, was a significant absence during the Harvard case’s arguments. She recused herself from the case due to her former position on Harvard University’s Board of Overseers."

    "title": "CNS Halloween Guide: Goatman and Chessie and Snally&#8230;oh my",
    "content": "The national capital area is rumored to be home to a wide variety of unusual creatures. This is the Capital News Service Halloween guide to your local ghouls, ghosts and things that go bump in the night. \nGoatman\nPrince George’s County’s own anthropomorphic night stalker, the Goatman, became a mainstream cryptid in the 1970s, said Stephen Barcelo, owner of the Cryptozoology and Paranormal Museum in Littletown, North Carolina. Goatman is believed to be responsible for the disappearance and/or deaths of several animals at the time. \n“Goatman’s one of those creatures favoring that old rail bridge that multiple people end up either falling off, being hit by a train, and things of that sort,” Barcelo said.\nThere isn’t any photographic evidence of Goatman, Barcelo said, but sightings feature a consistent description, “basically it’s your typical half-man, half-goat.”\nBarry Pearson, a folklorist and professor in the English Department at the University of Maryland, said that goats have deep roots in folklore from around the world. They range from satyrs to deities to Satan. \n“None of that has a whole lot to do with Goatman except to say that goats can be portrayed as really cute and cuddly  although they smell pretty bad  but everyone loves baby goats,” Pearson said. \n“On the other hand,” he said, “if you ever take the time to kind of look at a kind of a grown up goat, and look in their eyes, theres something a little bit creepy about them. The way their eyes are shaped, among other things, as well as the horns and other things that have connections to some of our representations of Satan, the devil as we know it.”\nThe Goatman legend fits into a specific kind of narrative, Pearson said, one generally told by teens to other teens. Bigfoot, on the other hand, is generally seen by adults. It also fits into the “teenagers on Lovers Lane” trope.\n“Youd probably be drinking beer if youre a teenager or around that age,” he said. “And youve heard from your older brother or sister the story about the Goatman and where hes located and how he hates teenagers. And so you decide, of course, thats just what youll do, youll go out and look for him and show off how brave you are. And essentially, you’ll drive out there and you do it as a group, and youre kind of hanging around waiting for something to happen. And sure enough, somebody will hear something and everyone will get scared and drive away.”\nGoatman could have his origins in a hermit who lived in the area and who, according to Pearson, strongly resembled a goat.\nChessie\nThe only aquatic member of the Washington metro area’s cryptid contingent is Chessie, a sea monster rumored to patrol the Potomac, the Chesapeake Bay and surrounding tributaries.\nThe creature’s name is lifted from “Nessie,” the shortened nickname for Scotland’s famed Loch Ness Monster. The details of reported sightings, dating back to 1938, reveal that Chessie may resemble its European counterpart closely. \nA 1980 New York Times article reported a Virginia farmer spotting a serpent-like creature in the Potomac River that he estimated to be 14 feet long. In the same article, an expert from the Virginia Institute of Marine Science said the creature was likely an anaconda that hitched a ride on a commercial sailing vessel from its tropical home. Potomac swimmers should breathe easier knowing that anacondas typically live for only about 10 years in the wild. \n“I haven’t seen any really good videos on this one,” Barcelo said. “They’re pushing it more to be part sea monster or part lizard, greenish in color.” \nWhile Chessie’s existence is hard to confirm, it symbolizes something tangible for its modern habitat. \nChessie serves as the unofficial mascot of the Chesapeake Bay Program, a regional partnership dedicated to upholding environmental standards in the bay’s watershed, according to Jennifer Starr, a committee coordinator in the program. \n“I am a believer in Chessie being the mascot of the bay program,” Starr said, without committing to the real-world existence of the creature. \nSnallygaster\nSarah Cooper, founder of the American Snallygaster Museum, says the beast is reportedly a chimera with features of a dragon, a bird, and, most peculiarly, tentacles coming out of its mouth. \nThe Snallygaster is unique to Maryland, though sightings of the monster did first appear in 1909, around the same time as early reports of the neighboring Jersey Devil. \nThe unusual moniker Snallygaster has its roots in “Schneller Geist,” or quick spirit, a term for a trickster spirit introduced to the region by German immigrants. Marylanders morphed the German into the more familiar Snallygaster. \nThe first reports of the Snallygaster appear in the Middletown Valley Register in 1909. The paper published reports of a “one-eyed dragon” terrorizing the population of Western Maryland (though it has occasionally veered into West Virginia).\nAccording to local legend, President Theodore Roosevelt postponed an African safari in 1909 so that he could hunt the Snallygaster, though this has never been proven.\n“In 1932, the Snallygaster had a resurgence and made headlines again, until its demise,” said Cooper. “According to a local moonshiner, the Snally was attracted to a vat of mash. It flew overhead, became overwhelmed by the fumes and dove headfirst into the vat where it drowned.”\nSarah Cooper was so inspired by the story of Snallygaster that she decided to launch the American Snallygaster Museum. The museum is tentatively set to open in Libertytown in December. \nCooper says there are many more cryptids in Maryland besides the Snallygaster: \n“There are loads more! The snarly yow, the Dwayyo, Chessie, Goatman, the Egg Heads, the Wicomico Cat Man and the Blue Dog of Port Tobacco (though he is more of a ghostly creature). Maryland is rich in cryptids, ghosts and folklore and I want to use my museum to celebrate all of those things. Keep Maryland magical!”\nLeaders who linger\nIn the halls of the United States Capitol, several former leaders are rumored to have never left, lingering in the marble halls and haunting visitors. \nIn what is now called Statuary Hall, John Quincy Adams served nine terms in the old House of Representatives chamber. On February 23, 1848, Adams suffered a cerebral stroke during a speech and collapsed on the House floor.\nTwo days later, he died in the nearby speaker’s office. According to Senate Historian Betty Koed, Capitol workers started to witness Adams’s ghost appearing to deliver a speech on the spot where “the Old Man Eloquent” fell.\nHenry Wilson, President Ulysses S. Grant’s vice president, is also said to appear in the Capitol halls. Known for his enjoyment of “tubbing,” relaxing in the marble bathtubs of the lower Senate wing, Wilson died of congestive chill during one of his bathtub sessions in 1875.\nMysterious sneezes have been heard in the empty hallways near the former vice president’s office, John Alexander said in his book, Ghosts: Washington’s Most Famous Ghost Stories. Guards of the Senate wing report a “damp chill in the doorway,” as well as the scent of an old soap provided for senators’ use in the bathtubs.\nIn 1890, Congressman William Taulbee of Kentucky was shot dead on the stairs to the House gallery during an argument with a journalist. Stains of Taulbee’s blood linger in the porous marble despite years of cleaning agents, according to Alexander’s book. \nEvery time a reporter stumbles on the steps, Alexander wrote, some Capitol employees laugh because they believe Taulbee’s spirit sticks around to trip journalists in revenge.\nIn the White House, former President Abraham Lincoln’s ghost is considered a frequent guest, sighted in the Lincoln Bedroom and the Yellow Oval Room, according to the White House Historical Association.\nWitnesses of Lincoln’s ghost include former First Lady Grace Coolidge, who claims to have seen Lincoln staring out a window toward the Potomac, Prime Minister Winston Churchill, and Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands, who fainted after Lincoln’s ghost allegedly knocked on her guest room door.\nDemon Cat\nAccording to old congressional tales, a haunted cat has long patrolled the basement of the U.S. Capitol, first appearing as a regular-sized tabby before growing massive in the face of its unlucky observer. \nThe appearance of the Demon Cat was officially documented in the Congressional Record around the time of the Civil War, according to a 1935 Washington Post article. \n“The eyes of this elephantined alley trouper are supposed to glow with all the hue and ferocity of the headlights of a fire engine entering one of Washington’s notoriously dark alleys,” wrote George O. Gillingham in the Post’s 1935 story on “Ghastly Apparitions.” \nThe Demon Cat has been reported in both the Capitol and the White House, and the tale is still passed around the Hill today, according to the U.S. Senate Historical Office."

    "title": "Pentagon sees China as chief threat even with Russian invasion of Ukraine",
    "content": "ARLINGTON, Va.  Despite Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, a Department of Defense report released Thursday calls China the greatest threat to the United States.\nThe unclassified 2022 National Defense Strategy, a report that lays the groundwork for future military planning, and calls the People’s Republic of China “our most consequential strategic competitor for the coming decades.”\nIt highlights China’s “increasingly aggressive endeavor to refashion the Indo-Pacific region,” and “authoritarian preferences,” a reference to China’s growing threat to militarily retake Taiwan.\nIn a Pentagon press conference, Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin told the media that China “is the only competitor out there with both the intent to reshape the international order and increasingly the power to do so.”\nThe report calls China a “pacing challenge” and notes that the country’s increasingly close relationship with Russia is a cause for growing concern.\nSimilarly, the report calls Russia’s war in Ukraine an “acute threat,” to be viewed as one problem amidst other concerns posed by North Korea, Iran, extremist organizations and  increasingly  climate change.\n“Unlike China,” Austin said, “Russia can’t systematically challenge the United States over the long term. But Russian aggression does pose an immediate and sharp threat to our interests and values.”\nSince the last report was released in 2018, the United States ended a two-decade-long war in Afghanistan and pulled nearly all troops from Iraq and Syria. The newest report represents a shift in policy from a focus on counterterrorism in the Middle East to renewed attention to near-peer competitors with nuclear weapons.\nThe new report emphasizes deterrence and collaboration with allies through three prongs, the first of which is “integrated deterrence,” a vague phrase calling for unified efforts among factions of the military, government and U.S. allies to prevent conflict.\n“Integrated deterrence means using every tool at the Department’s disposal, in close collaboration with our counterparts across the U.S. Government and with Allies and partners, to ensure that potential foes understand the folly of aggression,” the report reads.\nThe second prong is campaigning, which the report describes as “the deliberate effort to synchronize the Department’s activities and investments to aggregate focus and resources.” Campaigning seeks to address the most serious threat to the U.S. and military might in the future.\nThe final prong, “building enduring advantages,” refers to the Pentagon’s force readiness and infrastructure, particularly “undertaking reforms to accelerate force development, getting the technology we need more quickly.”"

    "title": "Maryland students, test pilots, fire questions at space station astronauts",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  The U.S. Naval Test Pilot School partnered Thursday with K-12 schools across southern Maryland to host a question and answer session with astronauts aboard the International Space Station. \nAstronauts Nicole A. Mann, Frank Rubio, and Josh Cassada of the Expedition 68 Space Station Crew participated live in the space-to-earth downlink call, aired on NASA Television. \nTest pilots under instruction and students from seven Maryland schools pre-recorded videos at the Naval Air Station Patuxent River, asking a variety of questions of the astronauts.\nLt. Erin Loft, a test pilot student, asked about the hardest part of adapting to microgravity conditions aboard the ISS, and Mann, the first Native American woman in space, showed off the strips of velcro sewn onto the astronaut’s pants. \n“You can imagine, you’re such a mess when you’re trying to get something done,” Mann said, because the air flow and microgravity inside the station makes tools float away.\nThe astronauts gave Mann’s niece, Brooklyn, a glimpse of daily life on the ISS, where Mann said the day starts with breakfast at 6 a.m. before an “incredibly packed, but very rewarding” 12 hours of work, including maintenance of the station and the science experiments aboard.\n“No day is like any other day, we get to do lots of different jobs. Sometimes we get to play chief medical officer, sometimes we get to play plumber or electrician, but above all things we get to play scientist,” Rubio said.\nCrew members monitor space station research experiments from a wide range of disciplines. A third grade student at Leonardtown Elementary School asked what experiments the astronauts are most excited to work on in space.\nOn Expedition 68, Rubio said, there are efforts underway to develop organs in space, and to grow tomato plants. \nRubio, who launched on the Russian Soyuz MS-22 last month, said he recently harvested the first tomato grown in space. Lt. Jordan Hernandez asked how involved the astronauts are in decision making with the experiments.\n“Up here, we kind of find ourselves in the role of a grad student,” Cassada said. Crew members follow guidance from scientists on the ground to further the experiments, but also lend their own insights from space.\nThe skills that Mann learned at test pilot school are “100% applicable everyday,” she told student Connor, because the astronauts have to be adaptable and learn quickly in order to execute their tasks and communicate results.\nCmdr. Jeremy DeBons, commanding officer of the U.S. Naval Test Pilot School, said that nearly 100 graduates of the school have gone on to become NASA astronauts.\nBoth Mann and Cassada are graduates of the school, and served as test pilots in the U.S. Marine Corps and the U.S. Navy before joining the expedition.\nIn their limited free time, Cassada said the crew enjoys playing with their meals in microgravity, making calls back to Earth to keep up with their families, and sneaking peeks out of the station windows. \n“Looking out that window, at Earth and looking at that atmosphere, you realize how lucky we are to live on planet Earth. It is quite a place and we need to protect it,” Cassada said.\nIn addition to the test pilot school, the Maryland schools participating in the call were Leonardtown Elementary School, Hollywood Elementary School, Town Creek Elementary School in Lexington Park, Evergreen Elementary School in California, Dowell Elementary School in Lusby, and the Chesapeake Charter School and Esperanza Middle School, both in Lexington Park."

    "title": "Hitting Ukraine civilian targets is Russian strategy, US official says",
    "content": "ARLINGTON, Va.  Russian forces are purposefully striking civilian infrastructure as part of a military strategy, a senior U.S. military official said during a status update on Ukraine this week. \n“We assess that Russia has deliberately struck civilian infrastructure and nonmilitary targets, with the purpose of needlessly harming civilians and attempting to instill terror among the Ukrainian population elsewhere on the battlefield,” said the official.\nSpeaking to reporters on background, the official said Russia’s indiscriminate attacks on nonmilitary objectives using missiles and Iranian drones, particularly in the Kharkiv region, have not yet yielded any significant gains.\nThe attacks are, however, depriving some civilians of critical infrastructure, including electricity and water.\nOleksandra Matviichuk, the head of Ukraine’s Center for Civil Liberties, is currently witnessing the recent bombardment firsthand in Ukraine.\nShe said Russia’s targeting of critical infrastructure is a deliberate tactic. In just three months, her organization documented 271 episodes of civilian infrastructure bombardment.\nAccording to Matviichuk, a 2022 Nobel Laureate, Russia’s recent civilian bombardment follows years of unchecked attacks on other nations. \n“It’s a result of total impunity, which Russia enjoyed for decades. Russia committed war crimes in Chechnya, in Moldova, in Syria, in Mali, in Libya, in Georgia, in other countries of the world, and they have never been punished for that,” Matviichuk said.   \nAlthough President Joe Biden has previously accused Russia of war crimes, the top military official stopped short of using the same language.\nWhen asked about the senior military official’s statement, Stephen Rapp, former U.S. ambassador-at-large for war crimes, said: “If those conditions are met, that is the very definition of war crimes. Intentionally attacking civilian infrastructure, civilian life, etc., is a war crime.”\nSpeaking on a panel hosted by the Syria Ukraine Network, a resource-sharing coalition linking Syrians with experiences under Russian bombardment to Ukrainians, Rapp said the past two weeks of Russian attacks violate international law. \n“Given the pattern that we’ve seen in the last two weeks, it’s a case that proves itself,” he said.\nHowever, retired Army Col. Yevgeny Vindman, a former Pentagon whistleblower also on the panel, said the Department of Defense might have a reason for not calling the indiscriminate attacks “war crimes.”\nVindman, who alerted officials to a 2019 call former President Donald Trump made asking Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to open a corruption investigation into then-candidate Biden, said military officials have a different role than officials in the White House. \n“It is the call of a different body – (the) Department of State’s or some other entity, to say ‘based on the findings we’ve gathered… we find that these are war crimes and therefore we’re going to indict,’” he said.\nStill, Vindman added that through his work with the State Department’s Atrocity Crimes Advisory Group, an organization dedicated to supporting the Ukrainian prosecutor general’s war crimes prosecution efforts, he has seen Russia targeting civilians firsthand.\n“I’ve seen the acceleration of indiscriminate attacks in Kharkiv but also targeted attacks on infrastructure… dams, power generation facilities, basic life support, water treatment facilities,” he said. \nBefore the recent spate of Russian bombing, Vindman said the Atrocity Crimes Advisory Group had 33,000 open war crimes cases in Ukraine. \nVindman said over 30% of power generation in Ukraine so far has been destroyed by bombardment, leading to concerns of a second large wave of refugees leaving the country as the winter sets in.\nDaniel Rebar, an American volunteer medic in Ukraine, said the official’s statement about the Russians targeting civilian installations came as no surprise. \nHis unit, the Hospitallers, composed of Ukrainians and international volunteers, recently observed Russian forces hitting civilian targets while deployed to Soledar, Ukraine. \nRebar described nonstop shelling.\nSoledar, a city in the Donetsk region, is currently seeing heavy fighting as Ukrainian forces advance into the previously Russian-held territory.\n“I’m not sure what role an evacuated school or a salt refinery have in a war – it seems these places were bombed only to hurt the people,” Rebar said in a telephone interview with Capital News Service while on a break from duties. \n“The point is to try to break the will,” he said. “The point is to make the Ukrainian people stop the fight. It’s had the opposite effect.”"

    "title": "Silver Line extension could begin service before Thanksgiving despite train shortage, officials say",
    "content": "WASHINGTON — An extension of the Metro’s Silver Line could be ready to service Washington Dulles International Airport in time for Thanksgiving travel, Metro officials said Wednesday.\nBut Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority executives said there won’t be enough railcars to support the extension opening without removing cars from other Metro lines, which are already crowded.\nMetro is relying on approval by the Washington Metrorail Safety Commission, which provides safety oversight for Metro’s operations, to open and operate the new Silver Line stations. The WMSC has been in conflict with Metro for weeks over a plan to add railcars back into service.\nA year ago, Metro sidelined its newest trains, the 7000-series rail cars, after one derailed between the Rosslyn and Arlington Cemetery Metro stations because of wheel issues. An investigation into the derailment has still not identified a cause, WMATA said.\nOne of the 7000 series cars Metro slowly has been reintroducing into service. (Courtesy of WMATA)\nMetro submitted a plan on Sept. 28 to request returning the full fleet, 748 of the 7000-series cars, for service. On Oct. 11, the safety commission rejected this plan, due to a “lack of data,” according to WMATA.\nAfter another revision by Metro, the plan was denied again, the commission said Monday, citing “technical objections.” Metro’s Executive Vice President and Chief Safety Officer Theresa Impastato said she is dismayed by the commission’s rejections.\n“We have provided all of the available data and analysis we have after safely running 2.7 million miles, however WMSC has provided confusing direction,” Impastato said in a WMATA release.  “We simply ask for clear guidance on what is required to satisfy them as to the integrity of our process.”\nCurrently, Metro has permission to use up to 20 of the 7000-series trains on the Red, Green and Yellow Lines.\nTo begin transferring trains to the necessary places, Metro officials need the safety commission’s approval this week, WMATA said.\nSharmila Samarasinghe, deputy CEO and chief operating officer of the safety commission, is calling for a revised plan from Metro based on “all available data.”\n“The WMSC is deeply concerned about Metrorail senior leadership’s incorrect statements that a failure to follow procedures in place to control known hazards such a wheel migration does not lead to unsafe conditions,” Samarasinghe said in a letter on Monday.\nWhen the Silver Line extension opens, the Metro will service three new stations in Fairfax County and three stations in Loudoun County, including at Washington Dulles International Airport.\nThe approval of the railcar introduction plan is needed, WMATA said, for the Silver Line expansion and for increased service frequency across the Metro system.\n“Metro recognizes the important role safety oversight plays and we are absolutely committed to compliance,” said Brian Dwyer, Metro’s executive vice president and chief operating officer. “Respectfully, after a year-long investigation, we would welcome a directive based on a root cause finding. Meanwhile, we have developed an industry-leading inspection process in which we have high confidence.”"

    "title": "Cardin and colleagues seek probe of deadly Kazakhstan demonstrations",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  Over 200 people died when demonstrations in Kazakhstan turned deadly earlier this year. Now, legislators are concerned U.S.-trained troops were involved. \nMaryland Sen. Ben Cardin joined Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Menendez of New Jersey and other Democrats in calling on the Biden administration to support an independent investigation of Kazakh security forces’ brutal suppression of widespread anti-government protests in January.\nIn response to reports that Kazakhstan deployed U.S.-trained KAZBAT security forces, the senators are urging a review of U.S. military assistance to the country.\nThe letter, addressed to Secretary of State Antony Blinken, said the senators are “deeply concerned by reports that KAZBAT security forces trained by the United States to participate in international peacekeeping missions were deployed during January, wearing UN peacekeeping helmets.”\nAnti-government protesters stormed Kazakhstan’s largest city, Almaty, in early January after the government ended fuel price caps, doubling gas prices overnight. The protestors called for an extensive government overhaul.\nIn response to demonstrations spreading quickly throughout the country, the authoritarian regime deployed huge numbers of police in an effort to curb the unrest. \nThe senators’ letter details reports of human rights abuses at the hands of Khazakh authorities, including torture, abuse and the deaths of demonstrators in state custody. The government of Kazakhstan, the senators said, has not appropriately investigated the reports. \n“Despite widespread reports of torture, only fifteen officials are being investigated for these actions. There are no reports of security officers being questioned or detained over the 238 deaths and growing evidence of the authorities pressuring witnesses to the January events to withdraw accusations of abuse by security forces,” the letter said. \nThe death total comes from an official list of 238 names released by Kazakhstan’s General Prosecutor’s Office of those declared dead as a result of the protests, including six people who died from torture in pre-trial custody.\nThe senators are not the first to call for independent investigations. \nIn July, six months after the deadly demonstrations, Human Rights Watch and nine other human rights organizations signed a joint statement calling on the Kazakhstan government to allow an independent investigation into the allegations of torture, abuse and death. \nA January Human Rights Watch report that analyzed over 80 videos of demonstrations between Jan. 4 and Jan. 6 found at least four instances where police used excessive force such as shooting at protesters. The report speculates that the actual number of incidents involving excessive force is most likely much higher.\nMihra Rittmann, a senior Central Asia researcher for Human Rights Watch, said in a country already fraught with human rights issues, Kazakhstan’s investigation of those responsible for the violence is a crucial component to reform and democratization.\nIt’s essential that the government shows that its willing to hold law enforcement accountable. People were killed, people died,” Rittmann said. “The government itself admits to six people dying in detention because of torture.” \n“And if there is no accountability for those crimes, for the people that were killed, for the people who died in detention, for people who were tortured, then the government loses legitimacy in the eyes of the people, she said.\nIn September, Kazakh President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev announced a measure granting amnesty and compensation to 421 people with suspected involvement in the riots and demonstrations. \nTo Rittmann, this may not be enough.\nThe government says that it is taking steps to democratize, it says that it has reforms underway, but so often those reforms don’t translate into actual changes on the ground,” Rittmann said. “There’s rhetoric but not meaningful change. And that has to change if there’s going to be a way that the Kazakh government can engage with its population that doesn’t result in mass arrest of people trying to peacefully protest."

    "content": "WASHINGTON  Senate Democrats raced against the clock to confirm federal judges at a historic rate before the midterm election. President Joe Biden has nominated and the Senate has confirmed 84 judges so far for district and circuit courts. \n“(Senate Majority Leader) Chuck Schumer (D-New York) and I both share the belief that this is a priority in this Congress,” Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Illinois, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, told Capital News Service.\nBiden has appointed more nominees in his first two years in office than any president in history except for John F. Kennedy, who had appointed 102 judges at the same time in his presidency. Biden has outpaced former Presidents Donald Trump, Barack Obama, and George W. Bush, who nominated 51, 42, and 72 judges, respectively, at this time in their terms, according to the Pew Research Center.\n“I think that the record number is fantastic, and its what we need for this country,” said Kimberly Humphrey, legal director for federal courts at the Alliance for Justice, a judicial advocacy group.\nAt the moment, there are 87 vacancies in the federal courts and 44 pending nominations, according to the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts.\nFacing numerous close midterm races, Democrats could lose their narrow majority in the Senate. In that case, they would need help from GOP colleagues to confirm any more Biden-nominated judges. \nWith the Supreme Court’s overturning of abortion rights in June’s ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Womens Health Organization a key issue in the midterms, Democrats are focused on moving as many judges through the Senate as possible, Humphrey said. \n“I think judges have always, quite clearly, been a priority for the Republicans,” she said. “And I think we see that in terms of the historic flip in our laws with the Dobbs decision. That was not something that happened overnight. That was 50 years in the making.” \nMany Americans are dissatisfied with the Supreme Court after the abortion ruling. According to the Pew Research Center, the Supreme Court’s approval rating is currently 48%, the lowest it has been in several decades.\nDemocrats also have had another motivation, Humphrey said: “The fact that former President Trump really was able to move a lot of appointees definitely made them want to be responsive or at least meet that pace.”\nIn total, Trump nominated three Supreme Court justices along with another 68 judges. \nBiden has also made history with the diversity of his judicial nominations.\nAccording to a recent White House tweet, 66% of the nominees were people of color and 68% were women. \nIn comparison, 12% of Trump’s judicial nominees were non-white and 29% were women, and 40% of Obama’s nominees were non-white and 50% were women, according to the Pew Research Center.\n“We’re making our courts fairer and more representative of our great nation,” Chuck Schumer said last month on the Senate Floor.\nBiden has also prioritized professional diversity, nominating judges with a variety of backgrounds.\n“I share President Biden’s goal of having a diverse federal judiciary that brings experience from the broader legal community to the bench, including public defenders and civil rights lawyers,” said Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Maryland. “Maryland’s nominees embody that commitment.” \nLast spring, Biden nominated Deborah Boardman and Lydia Griggsby for the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland. Before serving as judges, Boardman served as a public defender and Griggsby served as an attorney in the Justice Department’s Civil Division.\nSupreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, who was sworn in June 30, broke two barriers. \n“It has taken 232 years and 115 prior appointments for a Black woman to be selected to serve on the Supreme Court of the United States, but weve made it. Weve made it  all of us,” Jackson said in a speech in April shortly after her Senate confirmation.\nJackson is also the first Supreme Court justice who served as a criminal public defender.\nHumphrey believes professional diversity is important because it means “our federal system reflects the interests of all people, not just corporations.”\nHowever, Thomas Jipping, a senior legal fellow for the Edwin Meese III Center for Legal and Judicial Studies, which is part of the Institute for Constitutional Government at the conservative Heritage Foundation, said that if the diversity of Biden’s nominees dominates messaging, it could negatively impact public perceptions of the court.\n“This push for racial, sexual, and professional diversity leads to the perception that judges’ characteristics drive their decisions,” Jipping said. “It really destroys the trust that we extract from the public in terms of judicial impartiality.”\nWhile Biden has gotten many judicial nominees confirmed, he has gotten very few Republican votes. Republican Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, and Susan Collins of Maine have broken most often with GOP colleagues to confirm Biden picks.  \n“The current partisan divide is very clear from the data,” said Jipping. “I don’t think that’s a good thing.”\nIowa Sen. Chuck Grassley, the ranking Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said he opposed many of Biden’s nominees because he believes they are unqualified and did not perform well during the confirmation hearings.\n“This committee has voted to approve nominees that can’t answer basic questions,” Grassley said on Sep. 29. “Rubber stamping nominees without requiring answers is an abdication of our responsibility.”\nJudges are an issue politicians and many voters are passionate about because federal judges serve for life. \n“These judges and all of their rulings are going to impact our society for generations to come,” Humphrey said."

    "title": "Democrats try to buck history in midterm elections as GOP decries inflation",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  In an unusual midterm election, Democrats and Republicans both hold significant advantages and disadvantages, making the election so close many analysts are struggling to predict the outcome. \nWith less than four weeks to go until the Nov. 8 election  and with early voting already underway in some states  the political state of play reflects a dramatic change from where the country was at the beginning of this year when Republicans were gaining momentum as President Joe Biden’s approval rating was consistently declining and inflation was rising. \nHistorically, the president’s party usually loses seats in Congress (and sometimes the majority) as voters blame the party in power for any variety of real or perceived shortcomings. \nThis year, the dynamics have shifted significantly, as Charlie Cook, founder and contributor to the nonpartisan Cook Political Report, noted in a recent column.\n“Neither party has the benefit of a real tailwind; each has serious political exposure on important issues,” Cook said. “A midterm that normally would simply be a referendum on the president and governing party has now become more of a choice election.” \nThe fate of the Democratic majority in the House and Senate will come down to the outcomes in races for a handful of seats this year. \n!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var a in e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r=0;r\nIn the House, there are 221 Democrats and 214 Republicans. In the Senate, there are 50 Republicans and 48 Democrats (plus two independents who caucus with them; Vice President Kamala Harris provides tie-breaking votes to give her party the thinnest majority control). \nAn updated FiveThirtyEight election forecast Thursday said that Republicans have a 70% chance of taking over the House and Democrats have a 66% chance of holding on to the Senate.\nBiden’s job approval numbers, while still low, are improving, and Democrats have a potent issue, courtesy of the Supreme Court’s overturning of Roe v. Wade. The threat to reproductive rights is galvanizing women voters. \nThe election also is being conducted against the backdrop of the omnipresent chaos of former President Donald Trump’s legal problems and his persistent lies that the 2020 election was stolen from him. \nRepublicans are working to keep the public’s attention on inflation, crime in urban areas, immigration and what they see as over-spending by the Democrats. \n“If it turns out to be a very good year for the Democrats and they can hold on to the House, that would be by historical standards, a tremendous victory,” David Karol, an associate professor of government and politics at the University of Maryland, told Capital News Service. \n Here is an assessment of the crosswinds that are producing tight polls and keeping analysts guessing.\nRepublicans\nAccording to a recent NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll, the top issue for Republican voters in November’s election is inflation.\n“Usually inflation is not a problem. We haven't had it this (extreme) for about a little bit over 40 years,” Karol said.\nGas prices decreased by 4.9% over the last month, according to the Consumer Price Index, which is the largest price decrease of any commodity. Still, that decrease has been offset by the consistently spiking prices of other goods, like food and electricity. The CPI said food prices have increased 11.2% over the last year, and electricity prices rose 15.5%, which are slightly larger than August’s numbers, which marked the largest 12-month increases since May 1979 and August 1981, respectively.\nGas prices are likely to rise again after last week’s agreement among OPEC+ nations to cut oil production by 2 million barrels per day. \nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-California, who is eyeing the speaker’s chair, has repeatedly criticized the Biden administration and Democratic congressional leadership for their handling of inflation.\n“The Democrats continue to talk down to American families - no matter the increased cost of nearly everything,” McCarthy said in July on the House floor. “Worse, Democrats have no plan to fight inflation and put our country back on track.” \nIt’s a potent theme for the GOP, said Jacob Rubashkin, an analyst for Inside Elections, a nonpartisan newsletter. \n“You don't need a reporter to tell you that your groceries are more expensive or that it takes more money to fill up your gas tank than it did six months ago,” Rubashkin said. \nDon Smith, a voter from Delaware, is a libertarian but typically votes for the Republican candidates in elections. He recently got laid off from his job, and he just had his first child, so he said inflation is the top concern on his mind.\n“The things that affect my wallet tend to be the things that I think about the most,” Smith said.\nIn Maryland, 68% of adults believe inflation has caused financial hardship in their households, a recent Goucher/Baltimore Banner/WYPR poll found. \nRepublicans also are trying to position themselves as “tough-on-crime.” According to an NBC News poll, 45% of Republican voters view crime as an important issue, while only 22% of Democrats hold it as one of their top issues. \nRepublican candidates are attacking Democrats as soft on crime or even “pro-crime,” as Sen. Tommy Tuberville, R-Alabama, charged at a Nevada rally last weekend.  In various attack advertisements in the Pennsylvania Senate race, Republican Dr. Mehmet Oz has claimed Democrat Jon Fetterman is “dangerously liberal on crime.” \nImmigration is another major issue Republicans are focusing on to fire up their party’s base. The efforts are embracing racist tropes, including the neo-Nazi “replacement theory.” At a Trump rally over the weekend, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Georgia, claimed that “illegal aliens are on the verge of replacing you, replacing your jobs, and replacing your kids in school. And coming from all over the world, they’re also replacing your culture.”\nRecently, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, whose ideologies often align with Trump’s, sent thousands of asylum seekers to Democratic jurisdictions in buses and planes. DeSantis said in a press conference that sending migrants to Martha’s Vineyard would force communities nationwide to be “sharing in the burdens.” \nAccording to a poll from Politico/Morning Consult, “2 in 3 GOP voters said it’s appropriate that some Republican governors have sent thousands of migrants to liberal states and cities.”\nCritics said the move was a “soulless” political stunt to attract voters.\nDemocrats\nFor many Democrats, Trump is on the ballot in the midterms. \nAccording to a September Quinnipiac poll, “29 percent (of people) say one reason for their vote for U.S. Senator will be to express opposition to Donald Trump.” \nTrump-backed candidates running for the House and Senate, such as Oz and Ohio Senate candidate J.D. Vance, may be partially responsible for this new shift, Karol said. \n“(Trump) is actively involved in getting candidates nominated, with some success, and candidates feel compelled to take a stand about how the election was stolen and that there was fraud because of him and his supporters in the Republican Party,” Karol said. \nThe former president has also been the subject of near-constant news coverage, from the Mar-a-Lago investigation to multiple civil lawsuits and criminal probes, as well as the Jan. 6 hearings. All of these ongoing stories may influence voters’ decision-making on Election Day, according to Dave Wasserman, senior editor at the Cook Political Report.\n“The House GOP continues to be remade in former President Donald Trump's image,” Wasserman said. \nDemocrats have labeled the insurrection at the United States Capitol a “terrorist attack” and have made it a point to remind voters of this.\n“The MAGA Republicans didn’t side with law enforcement; they sided with the insurrectionists,” Biden said in remarks to the Democratic National Committee last month. “And they still do.  Don’t tell me you support law enforcement if you can’t condemn what happened on January the 6th.”\nThe GOP’s downplaying of the Jan. 6 assault and the party’s fielding of dozens of candidates who deny Trump lost in 2020 and say they may refuse to abide by election results this year has persuaded about a third of Democratic voters that the need to protect democracy is their top concern, according to a recent NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll.\nRight behind that are reproductive rights - the top issue among 21 percent of Democrats, according to that poll.\nAfter almost 50 years of Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court stripped away federal protections for women’s abortion rights in the Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization decision on June 24. \nStates now have the power to roll out trigger laws, which would determine the stage at which an abortion would no longer be considered legal, if at all.\nFor example, Texas has instituted a near-total abortion ban with only exceptions for medical emergencies. Randy Parsons, 71, and Rosie Parsons, 66, voters who live in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, said abortion is one of their top issues going into the midterms, and it is motivating them to vote for Democrats at the local and national level.\n“We just don’t have much pride in the way our state is being run right now,” said Randy Parsons, a retired social worker.\n The abortion decision prompted an uproar nationwide, causing a surge in registrations among women voters in many states and larger turnout by women voters in special elections. \nIn Alaska’s special election on Aug. 16, Mary Peltola, a Democrat, defeated former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, the GOP’s vice presidential nominee in 2008. Just weeks earlier, a majority of Kansans voted not to change the state’s constitution to make abortion illegal. Both were unexpected victories for Democrats.\n Democrats are depicting the Supreme Court’s abortion ruling as opening the door to state bans and assaults on other rights.\n“Sadly, the Dobbs decision was not based on a change in the law, only a change in the members of the Supreme Court,” Sen. Ben Cardin, D-Maryland, said in a recent letter to constituents. “This is the root cause of my trepidation. With an untethered conservative majority, what civil rights will be next to fall?”\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, along with many other Republicans, have not endorsed South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham’s proposal to ban abortions after 15 weeks nationwide, exempting rape and incest victims as well as mothers suffering from at-risk pregnancies. \nSome Republicans in competitive races are attempting to distance themselves from the abortion issue, going so far as to scrub their previous positions from campaign websites.  Karol said it is still unclear whether the abortion ban proposal is going to appeal to Republican voters in the midterms.\n“​The question is: how many people are going to vote on the basis of that issue? And we don't know,” Karol said. “If you’re concerned about inflation – if you're a traditional Republican voter – but you also happen to be pro-choice, how much weight do you give that factor?”  \nPost-election outcomes\nBiden has accomplished many of the goals he promised Americans during his presidential campaign, including securing a major infrastructure spending bill, reducing student loan debt, committing historic levels of spending to combat climate change, lowering prescription drug costs, addressing gun safety and taking steps aimed at cutting budget deficits.\n“The mere act of appearing like you're doing something, appearing like you're legislating and governing, has restored some of the confidence in the president that his own party had lost previously,” Rubashkin said.\nBut if Democrats lose their majorities in the House or Senate or both, future administration initiatives are likely to face a GOP roadblock. For example, if Democrats lose the Senate, they could not confirm more judges without bipartisan agreement from Republicans. \n“If Republicans take back either chamber there will be no real legislative agenda beyond keeping the government open and raising the debt ceiling,” Rubashkin said. “That's the fact of the matter.” \nOverall, the 2022 election will likely be atypical in many ways. While midterm turnout and interest are usually low, this year many voters seem to feel differently.\n“I think it's important. I think, a lot of times, everybody's just focused on voting for the president,” said Jordan Hobson, a New Jersey voter.  “We kind of forget about the midterms and (that) they have a big impact on the House and the Senate. I think it's a building block to help support the president's agenda.”"

    "content": "HAGERSTOWN, Md.- President Joe Biden told autoworkers here Friday that his policies and legislation he has gotten through the Congress are aimed at creating a “bottom-up” economy.\nBiden’s speech at the Volvo Group Powertrain plant was part of the White House’s “Made In America” campaign, highlighting what the president sees as the need to rebuild the economy “from the bottom up and middle out.”\n“This is the backbone of America, the people who get up every single morning and go to work, break their necks and make a living,” Biden said in remarks on the factory floor. “The working class and the middle class, that’s who built this country. And, by the way, the middle class built America and unions built the middle class.”\nHAGERSTOWN, Md.  President Joe Biden touts his economic policies during a speech at the Volvo Group Powertrain plant here on Friday. (Hunter Savery/Capital News Service)\nSince Biden’s inauguration, 10 million jobs have been created in the United States, the fastest job growth in history, according to the White House. Nationally, 236,000 jobs were created in September, according to the Department of Labor.\nThe monthly number was a decline from the 315,000 jobs created in August.\nDespite inflation, Biden and the Democrats  facing a tough battle with Republicans over control of the Congress in the midterm election that is a month away  are touting job growth and the administration’s investment in the U.S. infrastructure as major achievements.\nThe president has little to worry about in Maryland, which is predominantly Democratic.\nHagerstown has a “rich history” of manufacturing, said Mayor Emily Keller, who introduced Biden. The Volvo factory employs 1,700 people — of that, 1,300 are members of the United Auto Workers union.\n“President Bidens focus on bringing back manufacturing jobs to America will only help us move forward,” Keller said.\nRep. David Trone, D-Maryland, told the workers that the Biden administration’s initiatives will create infrastructure necessary to future economic success.\n“So by demonstrating compassion, civility and competence, President Biden is always putting people over politics,” Trone said, speaking before Biden.\nTo continue his agenda of strengthening the domestic economy, the president underscored the importance of political cooperation, acknowledging that some of the plant workers may be Republicans.\n“Well stop this bitterness that exists between the parties and have people working together,” he said.\nBiden pointed to the Inflation Reduction Act as a key achievement, saying that it would lower healthcare and energy costs for average Americans. He also said the new law would make large corporations pay their fair share in taxes and chastised Republicans who want to repeal the measure.\nThe president accused Republicans of hypocrisy for calling his infrastructure spending bill socialist and then asking for money after it passed and he signed it into law.\nBiden drew laughs with the quip: “I didn’t know there were that many socialist Republicans.”\nAt the end of his speech, the president took a forceful tone, saying that the United States is asserting itself as the dominant global economic power.\n“I’ve never been more optimistic. Just remember who the hell we are. We’re the United States of America,” Biden said. “Folks, nothing’s beyond the capacity if we work together.”"

The massive project, projected to cost $900 million, includes redesigning all exhibitions, building family care rooms and classrooms, and completely refacing the stone exterior of the building.\nWASHINGTON  Multiple aircraft hang from the ceiling of the Smithsonian Institutions National Air and Space Museum, which partially reopens to the public on Oct. 14. (Ekaterina Pechenkina/Capital News Service)\nAt a media preview on Thursday, Christopher Browne, John and Adrienne Mars Director of the National Air and Space Museum, said the museum will be operating at roughly 50% capacity because the National Mall entrance will not reopen with the facility’s west wing.\n“Even if the code said ‘sure, pack them in shoulder-to-shoulder’ we wouldn’t want to do that, because it would ruin the experience,” Browne said.\nThe museum will feature interactive and digital experiences, as well as hundreds of new artifacts, including the WR-3 air racer built by Neal Loving, the first African American certified to race airplanes, and a T-38 flown by Jackie Cochran, the first woman to break the sound barrier.\nWASHINGTON  Neil Armstrongs iconic Apollo spacesuit is displayed in the “Destination Moon” exhibit at the Smithsonian Institution’s National Air and Space Museum. (Ekaterina Pechenkina/Capital News Service)\n“Since the time the museum opened in 1976, a lot has changed,” Browne said. “The aviation and aerospace world has changed incredibly and who’s participating in it has changed. It’s become a much more diverse and inclusive space that we want to celebrate.”\nExpansions of existing exhibits focused on making storytelling accessible and available to those with physical impairments, Browne said, through the introduction of tactile models and places to plug hearing-assistive devices into most interactive displays.\nExhibitions opening next week include “Destination Moon,” where visitors can stand face to face with Neil Armstrong’s A-7L lunar spacesuit from his first step onto the Moon. From the Apollo 11 mission, the exhibit also includes astronaut survival kits, tactile models of the F1 engines and Armstrong’s spacesuit gloves.\nWASHINGTON  “The Wright Brothers  the Invention of the Aerial Age” exhibit at the Smithsonian Institution’s National Air and Space Museum features an iconic artifact: the original 1903 Wright Flyer. (Ekaterina Pechenkina/Capital News Service)\n“Part of the benefit we have from being half to go is we’re going to learn. We want to hear from our visitors about what’s working… especially from folks who may not have mobility or vision or hearing,” Browne said.\nIn the Kenneth C. Griffin Exploring the Planets Gallery, visitors can simulate standing on the surface of other planets, surrounded by two immersive curved screens, and practice directing a rover across the surface of Mars.\n“We are living right now in the golden age of planetary exploration, and this gallery is capturing it as best as possible,” said Dr. Robert A. Craddock, planetary geologist and the curator for the gallery, who has worked at the museum for 34 years. Ever since Craddock watched the Apollo 8 astronauts take off to the Moon on television, he’s been inspired to get involved in planetary science.\n”Today we get more data from the planets than we did in the first fifteen years of space exploration. We are trying to capture that and bring it to the American public,” Craddock said.\nThe gallery features a unique collection of artifacts that represent different planets and the phases of the history of human planetary exploration, as well as a tour of the solar system.\nWASHINGTON  Visitors to the Smithsonian Institutions National Air and Space Museum will be able to replicate the experience of being on board the International Space Station and looking down at the Earth. (Destiny Herbers/Capital News Service)\nOne of the museum’s longtime centerpieces, the original 1903 Wright Flyer, has been moved to a dynamic new exhibit, “Wright Brothers  the Invention of the Aerial Age,” featuring touch screens allowing visitors to take a zoomed-in, 360-degree view of the delicate mechanics Wilbur and Orville Wright used to take flight.\n“Every airplane that flies embodies this one. Every airplane that you fly on is essentially a Wright Flyer,” Peter Jakab, former chief curator of the museum, told Capital News Service. “(Visitors) have a few minutes to come here, engage with this object, and really think about how the world we live in today, in a large measure, stems from this object.”\nRenovations have placed iconic artifacts in new settings to celebrate their impact on history, Browne said. But the museum also strives to be a place of learning, gathering new artifacts to highlight the stories, like Cochran’s, that allow visitors to connect at a personal level.\nThe museum is holding weekly meetings to tackle the issue of how to present new discoveries to the public.\n“Any given day there are probably over a dozen different new discoveries that we are discussing…It’s a firehose, basically,” Craddock said.\n“We are trying to inspire everybody, to show that everybody has an opportunity to be involved with aviation or space exploration,” he added.\nThe west end of the Air and Space Museum will be open to the public from 10 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. every day except for Christmas Day starting Oct. 14. Visitors can reserve free, timed-entry passes on the museum’s website."

    "content": "WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court heard arguments Tuesday in a case over Alabama’s 2021 congressional redistricting plan. Although Black people make up 27% of Alabama’s population, the map includes just one majority-minority district, where Black voters constitute the majority. \nEvan Milligan, executive director of the civic engagement group Alabama Forward, sued John Merrill, the Alabama Secretary of State, alongside other voting interest groups in three federal court cases. \nTheir argument hinges on Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which says that states must prevent racial minorities from having “less opportunity than other members of the electorate to participate in the political process and to elect representatives of their choice.” The plaintiffs presented 11 maps to prove that creating two majority-Black districts that complied with other traditional Alabama redistricting requirements was possible. \nIn January, a three judge panel ruled that Alabama’s new congressional maps likely did violate the Voting Rights Act and gave the state two weeks to create a new one. Alabama made an emergency appeal to the Supreme Court to stay the ruling. \n!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var a in e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r=0;r\nIn a 5-4 decision, the court agreed to let Alabama keep its proposed map until the case could be argued before the court. The three liberal justices were joined by Chief Justice John Roberts in dissent, saying that there was already precedent in place from a 1986 Supreme Court ruling. \nIn Thornburg v. Gingles, the court found that the North Carolina legislature’s redistricting plan violated Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act by grouping Black voters in such a way that it would be difficult if not impossible to elect their preferred candidates. And, before the Court heard the case, Congress clarified Section 2 to mean that plaintiffs only had to prove discriminatory effect - not discriminatory intent - for the Voting Rights Act to be violated.\nAlabama’s Solicitor General Edmund Lacour made a varied and complicated set of arguments before the justices Tuesday, arguing both that the redistricting plan submitted by the plaintiffs did not meet the procedural standards set out by the 1986 ruling. He also contended that a map with more than one majority-minority district would be “racially gerrymandered,” allegedly violating the 14th Amendment. \nLacour seemed to suggest that such a map would disproportionately benefit Black people and harm white people. \n“Single member districting is uniquely zero sum,” he said. “If you have a neutral plan and someone comes in and upsets it to racially gerrymander in favor of one racial group, necessarily you’re going to be harming some other group on account of race.”\nThe justices appeared skeptical of Alabama’s arguments, especially liberal Justices Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson. \nConservative Justice Amy Coney Barrett also expressed confusion about Lacour’s arguments: “Mr. Lacour, I think I’m struggling in the same way that some others have about narrowing down exactly what your argument is. You know, I disagree with you and agree with Justice Kagan’s characterization of the intent point. Our precedent and the statute itself says that you don’t have to show discriminatory intent, so put that aside.”\nNotably, Jackson argued that the Equal Protection Clause and of the 14th Amendment were adopted in a “race-conscious way.” \n“I don’t think we can assume that just because race is taken into account that that necessarily creates an Equal Protection problem,” Jackson said. “‘(The country’s Framers and Founders) were in fact trying to ensure that people who had been discriminated against, the freedmen during the Reconstruction period, were actually brought equal to everyone else in society… That’s not a race-neutral or race-blind idea in terms of the remedy, and even more than that, I don’t think that the historical record establishes that the Founders believed that race neutrality or race blindness was required.” \nKagan suggested that previous rulings should have resolved this dispute without it needing to be brought to the Supreme Court saying, “What strikes me is that under our precedent this should be a slam dunk.” \nThis is the third major challenge to the Voting Rights Act to be argued before the Supreme Court since 2013. The previous two, Shelby County v. Holder and Brnovich v. Democratic National Committee, both resulted in significant constraints on the Voting Rights Act. \nKagan said Tuesday that the Voting Rights Act has not fared well at the court in recent years, “And you’re asking us essentially to cut back substantially on our 40 years and to make this, too, extremely difficult to prevail on. So what’s left?”"

    "title": "Maryland senators to Pentagon: address toxic chemicals on bases",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  Maryland Sens. Chris Van Hollen and Ben Cardin, both Democrats, have joined a host of other lawmakers in an open letter to the Pentagon to increase resources for cleaning up toxic chemicals found on military bases. \nAt issue are what are known as PFAS, which stands for per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances, a group of “forever chemicals” that come from consumer and industrial goods and that can cause a variety of diseases in humans. \nThe letter, signed by over three dozen senators from both parties, said PFAS found in aqueous film-forming foam (AFFF), a fire suppressant used by the military, personal protective equipment used by firefighters and other products, left those who served at military installations at a higher risk of health problems. \n“Nearly 700 military installations nationwide have known or suspected PFAS contamination, exposing service members and their families, and civilian communities near DoD installations to these toxic chemicals,” the senators wrote in a letter to Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin.\nA recent report by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine presented evidence that PFAS exposure was associated with lower antibody responses, elevated cholesterol, decreased infant and fetal growth and  increased risk of kidney cancer in adults. \nAccording to the report, those who have worked or resided at places with identified PFAS contamination should have regular blood testing. The report specifically mentions military bases as locations where PFAS have been identified. \nIn 2022, Congress allocated $517 million for military PFAS-related testing,  research and cleanup. The senators said the Department of Defense has not done enough.\n“It is our understanding that one of the major obstacles in the way of Congress putting more resources toward this problem is a lack of planning by the Department on how to execute a higher funding level,” the senators said. “Simply put, DoD is not sufficiently prioritizing PFAS testing, remediation and disposal as part of its annual budget process, nor is the Department adequately developing the appropriate plans to utilize even higher funding levels as provided by Congress.”\nA spokesperson for the Department of Defense declined a request for comment and said the Department will respond to Congress accordingly. \n​​Jared Hayes, a PFAS-focused policy analyst with nonprofit activist organization Environmental Working Group, said there are almost 400 DoD bases with confirmed PFAS contamination in either drinking water and/or groundwater. At least 300 additional bases have suspected contamination. \nAccording to Hayes, some of the highest levels of PFAS contamination in Maryland have been found at Naval Research Lab, Ft. Meade and Webster Field Naval Annex. He said PFAS found at bases such as these contribute to the contamination of local fish and shellfish.\nHayes said,  “while there may be bases around the U.S. with higher levels of contamination, the high levels of PFAS and the concentration of so many DOD bases along such an important waterway as the Chesapeake Bay, makes Maryland bases stand out in the U.S.”"

    "title": "Senators would sanction nations recognizing Russian annexation of Ukraine territory",
    "content": "(This story has been updated)\nWASHINGTON –  Sens. Lindsey Graham and Richard Blumenthal introduced legislation Thursday that would terminate all U.S. assistance to any country that recognizes annexation of Ukrainian territories by Russia.\nRussian President Vladimir Putin formally annexed occupied Ukrainian territories  Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, Kherson  on Friday during an official ceremony.\nPresident Joe Biden on Friday said the United States and its allies would impose additional sanctions on people and organizations involved in the attempted annexations.\nThe United States condemns Russia’s fraudulent attempt today to annex sovereign Ukrainian territory, Biden said in a statement. Russia is violating international law, trampling on the United Nations Charter, and showing its contempt for peaceful nations everywhere.\nMake no mistake: these actions have no legitimacy, the president continued. The United States will always honor Ukraine’s internationally recognized borders. We will continue to support Ukraine’s efforts to regain control of its territory by strengthening its hand militarily and diplomatically, including through the $1.1 billion in additional security assistance the United States announced this week.\nHouse Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Maryland, said Putin thinks he can bully the democratic world but freedom-loving nations will not be cowed.\nThese referenda were orchestrated through violence and coercion, with the results predetermined according to Putin’s designs long before the first ballots were forced, Hoyer said in a statement. Their results reflect nothing less than his desperation in the face of military defeats and have no connection to the will of the people living in those areas.\nMake no mistake: Ukraine has a right to defend itself against invasion and to liberate its territories and its citizens from enemy occupation, the lawmaker said.\nBlumenthal, D-Connecticut, said in a press conference Thursday that any nation that aids and abets Vladimir Putin in this absolutely illegal action ought to be held responsible for its complicity.\n“No economic aid, no military aid to any country that recognizes this annexation,” the senator said.\nThe bipartisan legislation is being offered in two forms, as a stand-alone bill and as an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act, which is expected to be taken up after the November elections.\nBlumenthal said that he and Graham would also consider a resolution for unanimous adoption to respond as quickly as possible to the potential annexation.\n“It is a land grab, it’s a steal, and it is another craven, brazen tactic by Vladimir Putin to test the West’s support for Ukraine, and we are having none of it, nor should any other nation,” Blumenthal said.\nThe bill would stop all nations recognizing the annexed territories from receiving U.S. aid of any kind.\n“You will have a choice here. If you side with Putin to recognize his illegal annexation of parts of Ukraine, you will lose all support from the United States and we’ll do everything in our power to marginalize you on the world stage,” Graham, R-South Carolina, said.\nBlumenthal said he and his colleague expect support from senators in both parties.\nThe pair sponsored a Senate resolution  unanimously adopted in July  calling upon the secretary of state to designate Russia as a state sponsor of terrorism.\nCountries under such a designation face financial restrictions and bans on defense exports, but the designation also includes sanctions against other countries engaging in certain trade with a state sponsor of terrorism.\nFour countries are currently designated as state sponsors of terrorism: including Syria, Iran, North Korea, and most recently, Cuba.\nRussia’s allies  including India, Brazil, and Turkey  disapprove of the planned annexation and some have openly condemned it, Blumenthal said, meaning “Putin has no friends on this issue.”\nGraham also announced plans to propose a “small change” in U.S. law to allow investigators from the International Criminal Court to operate in the United States to seek evidence of Russian war crimes committed in Ukraine.\n“We will continue this effort to hold accountable nations that fail to side with international law, the fight for freedom, and independence in Ukraine,” Blumenthal said.\nIn the Senate’s continuing resolution, passed on Thursday, Ukraine is budgeted to receive another $12 billion dollars in aid, Graham said, which would provide Ukraine financial backing to continue fighting Russia into 2023.\nRussia’s potential threat of using nuclear weapons is “nuclear blackmail,” Graham said, and if Putin were to explode a nuclear weapon in Ukraine, the senator said he would view it as a direct attack on NATO.\nRadiation spread would not be contained to Ukraine, Blumenthal said, becoming an attack in “practical reality” with catastrophic consequences, especially in Poland.\n“As Putin becomes more provocative, we have to stand up, not stand down,” Graham said."

    "title": "A better-funded Democrat tries to take down Maryland’s only GOP House member",
    "content": "NORTH EAST, Md. – Heather Mizeur’s campaign for Maryland’s First Congressional District seat has raised $1,570,809 so far, more than any of the last four Democratic candidates who came before her, according to Federal Election Commission records. \nHouse election experts, however, only give her a slim chance to unseat Republican incumbent Rep. Andy Harris in November. He has held the seat since 2011 and has raised $955,507 so far in his campaign for reelection, according to the FEC.\n“Our elections are not really contests between competing visions and candidates of different backgrounds and qualifications anymore so much as they are censuses of how many Democrats and Republicans live in a given area,” said Dave Wasserman, senior editor at the nonpartisan Cook Political Report. \nMaryland’s First District is the largest in the state by geographic area, comprising the entire Eastern Shore, as well as parts of Harford, Baltimore and Carroll Counties. Election experts say the rural electorate remains the main roadblock for Democrats hoping to turn the district blue.\n“It’s always leaned towards Harris. Hes got a pretty strong foothold over the Eastern Shore,” said Candace Turitto, the program director of applied political analytics at the University of Maryland.\nMizeur said she has heard it all and has seen firsthand how the last two Democratic challengers fared in their attempts to unseat Harris. \nIn 2018, former Army Ranger Jesse Colvin received 38.1% of the vote, compared to Harris’ 60%. In 2020, 20-year military veteran Mia Mason received 36.4% of the vote, with Harris getting 63.4%. \nDespite what the past may say about her chances, Mizeur’s campaign churns forward with what she describes as tangible grassroots momentum.\n“I think what’s different this time is the experience I bring and my emphasis on bipartisanship and the unity coalition I’m creating in the campaign,” Mizeur told Capital News Service. “That’s no disrespect towards Jesse Colvin or Mia Mason. I worked to support both of them and they worked hard and did their best under very tough circumstances.”\nMizeur brings more experience in government to the table than either of her predecessors, having served two terms in the Maryland House of Delegates from 2007 to 2015, representing an area in Montgomery County. She also ran in the Democratic gubernatorial primary in 2014. \nMizeur said that 84% of contributions to her 2022 campaign have come from people donating $100 or less, giving her confidence that she has the individual support necessary for a successful campaign. \n“In this district, meeting the moment means taking that excitement and marrying it to a similar hunger for rejecting what has been a failure of leadership for us in Andy Harris,” Mizeur said.\nMizeur’s campaign is focused on lowering the cost of living, bringing better jobs to the district and “centering farmers in our environmental protection strategies,” according to her website.\nHarris, by contrast, is mirroring the GOP message of other House candidates this fall: he is opposed to what his campaign website calls “the Biden-Pelosi agenda,” and wants to “save our schools and protect our pocketbooks.”\nHarris, Mizeur and Libertarian candidate Daniel Thibeault are slated to square off in a debate on Oct. 26, hosted by Cecil TV at Cecil College in North East, Maryland. \nWhile Harris’s hold on the district may remain strong, his involvement in the Jan. 6 insurrection at the United States Capitol drew the attention of the select House committee investigating the attempted coup. \nHarris was present at a Dec. 21, 2020, meeting at the White House where then-President Donald Trump discussed a plan to “encourage members of the public to fight the outcome on Jan. 6,” according to testimony from Rep. Stephanie Murphy, D-Florida, at a House panel hearing in July. \nHarris said in a statement to 47ABC that he hadn’t had a chance to watch the hearing, as he “was busy working on important issues like bringing down the price of gas and groceries and securing our communities against violent crime.” \n“This is a Freedom Caucus member from a very blue state who has gone out of his way to antagonize Democrats,” Wasserman said. “There are plenty of Democratic donors in Maryland who want to do something about it, but their only shot at beating him was through redistricting.”\nWhile experts give Mizeur a relatively slim chance today, a redistricting effort championed by Maryland Democrats could have made this election a drastically different story.\nIn November 2021, the Maryland Legislative Redistricting Advisory Commission released its first proposed map. If this original map had been implemented, the First District, which has included primarily red counties on the Eastern Shore, would have included parts of Annapolis. Annapolis has historically been one of the bluest parts of the state and Biden won the area in an overwhelming victory in 2020.\n“Its kind of like taking an ice cold Democratic ice cube and dropping it in a bowl of red hot Republican soup,” Turitto said.\nAccording to Turitto, while the map would not have completely ruled out a Harris victory, it certainly would have altered the discourse around the race.\nIn March 2022, Anne Arundel County Senior Judge Lynne A. Battagli struck down the proposed map, citing “extreme partisan gerrymandering.”\nThe legislature was ordered to draw a new map, which evidently pleased Harris and once again provided him with a safe seat in Congress. Republican Gov. Larry Hogan approved the map in April.\n“Thankfully, despite the attempts by progressives in Annapolis to draw new district lines to such an unfair degree that it would ensure no Republicans serve Maryland in Congress for the next ten years, voters got a map that is fair, compact, and respects geographical boundaries such as the Eastern Shore,” Harris said in a statement to CNS. \nThis current district map will stand through 2032 until the census is redone.\n“Ten years from now, if Democrats pursue a more ambitious map that passes court muster, then there’s a chance” to win the First District, Wasserman said. “But at least for now the most likely outcome is a 7-1 Democratic majority” in the state’s House delegation."

    "title": "State attorneys general press US archivist to publish ERA as constitutional amendment",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  State attorneys general for Illinois and Nevada are renewing the push to publish the Equal Rights Amendment as the 28th Amendment to the Constitution. \nThe D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals heard oral arguments Wednesday in a suit contending that the ERA has been ratified by the necessary 38 states and has come into force. Therefore, attorneys generals argued that the archivist of the United States should publish the amendment as part of the Constitution. \nDavid Ferriero, the former archivist, declined to publish the amendment after Virginia ratified it in 2020, citing the 1979 deadline for ratification imposed by Congress. The plaintiffs in the suit claim that Congress does not have the constitutional authority to impose deadlines on states ratifying new amendments. \n!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var a in e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r=0;r\nReps. Carolyn Maloney, D-New York, Eleanor Holmes Norton, D-District of Columbia, Jan Schakowsky, D-Illinois, Brenda Lawrence, D-Michigan and Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul, held a press conference Wednesday outside of the United States Capitol with women's rights activists, calling for the recognition of the ERA. \n“​​We will lift our voices and we will fight,” Lawrence said. “We need the ERA to ensure that the rights of women and girls will not be rolled back by any political trend but instead be preserved as basic rights guaranteed by this Constitution.” \nA previous suit brought by Virginia’s attorney general was dismissed in March 2021 by a lower court.\nDOJ attorneys representing the U.S. archivist argued that the states lacked standing to bring the suit and that the archivist has no role in determining whether the ERA is in force. Plaintiffs contended that the archivist has an obligation to post the law.  \nIn January 2021, Sen. Ben Cardin, D-Maryland, and Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, introduced a joint resolution to remove the deadline to ratify the ERA.\n“A vote to remove the arbitrary deadline set by Congress will make it crystal clear that the Equal Rights Amendment has been ratified and is now part of our Constitution,” Cardin said.\nMaloney and Schakowsky, encouraged Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-New York, to schedule a vote on the topic. \n“It's important to note where every senator stands on the ERA, so that the women and like-minded men can hold them accountable in the midterm elections,” Schakowsky said. \nZakiya Thomas, president and CEO of the ERA Coalition, said: “The Coalition is pursuing all possible avenues to recognize and implement the ERA - including not only this lawsuit but also action by Congress. The House has twice passed a resolution making clear that the time limit does not stand in the ERA’s way.”\nBear Atwood, vice president of the National Organization for Women, said “it’s time” for the U.S.  archivist to recognize the ERA. \n“Women have been fighting to be added into the Constitution for 100 years now. And we've done everything we're supposed to do to ratify a change to the Constitution,” Atwood said Wednesday.\nCongress set a deadline for the states to ratify the ERA by 1979, however the number of states that ratified the amendment did not reach 38, the required three-quarters of states, until 2020. \nThe first iteration of the ERA was introduced in Congress in 1923. But the current ERA was born during the “women’s movement” in 1971. It was introduced by then-Rep. Martha Griffiths, D-Michigan, who became known as the “mother of the ERA.”"

    "title": "Afghan evacuees press for bill that could help give them US legal status",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  For 105 days, beginning in December 2021, Afghan-American Safi Rauf lived in an 88-foot cell in Taliban-controlled Afghanistan with few connections to the outside world. \nNow, he is running a 24-hour “fireguard”  with dozens of other volunteers outside the United States Capitol to raise support for the Afghan Adjustment Act. \nThe bipartisan bill, introduced in both the House and the Senate, would provide Afghans who worked with the United States during the 20-year war in Afghanistan a clear path to legal residency. \nThe Afghan Adjustment Act was not included in the stopgap spending bill to fund the federal government after Friday. Supporters hope it will be included in the upcoming defense policy bill or an expected continuing resolution in December.  \nThe Department of Homeland Security reports that approximately 82,000 Afghans have been evacuated to the United States since the 2021 withdrawal from Afghanistan and the Taliban’s rise to power. \nMost evacuees live in this country under humanitarian parole status, which normally lasts two years. The bill would allow Afghans who pass additional vetting to apply for permanent legal status. \nWASHINGTON  Safi Rauf, the founder and president of Human First Coalition, has been leading a 24-hour firewatch in front of the United States Capitol, pressing for passage of the Afghan Adjustment Act. (Eve Sampson/Capital News Service)\nRauf, a Navy reservist and the founder and president of Human First Coalition, a nonprofit that works to provide humanitarian aid and resettlement assistance to vulnerable Afghans, estimates his organization has evacuated over 10,000 people from Afghanistan in the last year. \nThe nonprofit chartered several flights after U.S. forces left Afghanistan. But when visiting the country for a planning trip last December, Rauf and his brother, Anees Khalil, who also works for Human First Coalition, were taken hostage by the Taliban and tortured.\n“You cannot prepare for something like that,” he told Capital News Service. “Every day was incredibly hard. Initially they put us in a basement that was not really fit for living. It was just a basement that did not have any ventilation, any blankets, any mattresses.” \nRauf said he and his brother were forced to go a month without showering while wearing the same clothes. \nBathroom breaks were scheduled and supervised and meals scarce – meager portions of tea, rice, beans and bread. Rauf said his captors left the lights on all day. He spent most of his time lying down, marking a calendar he scrawled on the wall. \nThe brothers eventually attempted multiple hunger strikes to protest their treatment. \nEventually, the U.S. government secured the brothers’ release on April 1.\n“Our world basically stopped on December 18,” Rauf said. “When I got out on April 1st, the world had moved on.”  \nStill, Rauf cannot slow down. He is haunted by the hundreds of calls he still receives from Afghans begging for help. \n“I’m still getting chaotic messages from people who are scared for their lives,” he said. “The administration is doing their best but how do you work with a de-facto authority that doesn’t recognize human rights?” \nIn folding chairs outside of the Capitol building, former Afghan pilots and parliamentary members are among the volunteers who help themselves to traditional Afghan food while petitioning for the legislation’s passage. In front of a folding table with information about the bill, the American flag waves alongside the Afghan flag. \nOn Thursday evening, Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minnesota, who introduced the bill in the Senate, came out to the lawn for an impromptu visit with the group.\nAddressing the volunteers, who included members of the Georgetown Institute for Women, Peace and Security, Women for Afghan Women and various former military members, Kloubacher thanked the group for continuing to campaign for Afghans. \n“I thank you for sitting out here on the lawn to remind our colleagues that promises made, promises kept,” she said, her hand upon the shoulder of an Afghan woman. “And there (are) promises made to the people who stood on the side of democracy and freedom with our military in Afghanistan.”"

    "title": "Signs of rising voter registrations by women could alter midterm election history",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  Midterm elections historically have low voter turnout, but recent increases in voter registration among women in many states could make November’s election a major exception, a change in pattern that potentially could help Democrats. \nAfter the Supreme Court in June overturned the constitutional right to an abortion, TargetSmart, a political data firm, identified a historic wave of new voter registrations among women  and they turned out in recent special elections. \nEarlier in the year, Republicans were polling well, as traditionally expected of the party not in the White House during midterm elections, TargetSmart CEO Tom Bonier, told Capital News Service in an interview. But he said June’s court ruling has shown the potential to disrupt the existing narrative of a good year for Republican candidates.\n“The notion is, if theres a group of voters who have become more engaged in an election after a certain point or a certain event, that you would see it in voter registration because if they’re really more engaged, more of them will be registering to vote,” Bonier said.\nThe ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization overturned two prior Supreme Court decisions, Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey, giving individual states the power to regulate all aspects of abortion not otherwise regulated by federal law.\n“For 50 years, states have been unable to enact even modest protections for unborn children… Not anymore. Now the American people get their voice back,” Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, said in a statement about the decision.\nFollowing the decision, abortion bans immediately took effect in 13 states, according to the Center for Reproductive Health’s abortion law tracking map, and 13 more states are considered “hostile,” which means they are likely to criminalize abortion soon.\n“Because the Dobbs decision was so overreaching, it was seismic in its impact,” Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-New York, said during a Sept. 15 press conference. \nTargetSmart is observing surges in voter registration among women in states with competitive Senate and gubernatorial races like Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Ohio. Those states will be key races to watch, Bonier said, where Republicans were counting on an election cycle advantage.\nThe Senate currently is evenly divided among Democrats and Republicans, but by virtue of Vice President Kamala Harris’s ability to break tie votes, the Democrats are in control. So a change in a single seat will determine which party runs the Senate starting in January.\nIn August, Kansas voters shot down a proposed amendment that would have removed all abortion protections from the state’s constitution. There was a huge gender gap among voters in Kansas, Bonier said, with 56% of the ballots cast by women.\nWomen were registering to vote in Kansas as well, Bonier said, with almost a 40-point gender gap in new registrations between the Supreme Court’s abortion ruling and the August vote.\nKansas broke its usual midterm pattern, Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minnesota, said at a press conference on recent abortion legislation.\n“As weve seen already across the country, the sunflower state of Kansas, over 500,000 people showed up to vote on the side of a womans right to make her own healthcare decisions,” Klobuchar said. “Thats more than showed up overall in its entirety in the last midterm.” \n“A strong outreach and information campaign led by countless organizers and volunteers was critical to that outcome and ensured citizens were aware of the stakes and of the deliberate campaign to confuse them about what a YES or NO vote meant,” Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Maryland, said in a campaign fundraising letter earlier this month. He is running for reelection. “Kansas shows that if we are organized and determined we can effectively fight back at the ballot box.” \nThe surprise results in the Kansas election suggest there may be more uncertainty in this fall’s contests than many analysts and politicians initially assumed, Bonier said. \nGender gaps are appearing across the country  not to the same degree as Kansas  but larger than has been seen in any previous election, Bonier said. Early indicators show that women are much more engaged in the election cycle than they were before the abortion ruling.\nGOP candidates have a challenge, Amy Walter, publisher and editor-in-chief of the non-partisan Cook Political Report, said on a recent podcast, “Hell and High Water with John Heilemann.”\n“To me, the big question going forward for some of these Republicans is, how do they keep the focus on the issue they want, which is Biden plus economy, without seemingly ignoring this big elephant in the room, which is abortion?” Walter said. “Just thinking you’re going to run all on economy and not address an issue that is clearly very important to a significant segment of voters I don’t think is completely sustainable.”\nDemocratic Sen. Tammy Duckworth, who is running for reelection in Illinois, agreed that the abortion issue has energized women voters.\n“Those women who have said, ‘You know what? Ive never voted on abortion before. Its been something that I support and something Im concerned about, but Im voting on abortion this time.’ These are women on both sides of the aisle,” Duckworth said. “Let me tell you, like in Kansas, theyre voting on it now.” \nSpecial election results have shown similar patterns since June, with Democratic candidates winning in Alaska’s at-large congressional district and New York’s 19th District, and a Republican candidate winning by a smaller margin than expected in New York’s usually red 23rd District. \n“Democrats are already talking about this issue all across the country and the nation is already rallying for the right to an abortion and against these Republican harmful attacks,” Sen. Patty Murray, D-Washington, said about the recent abortion legislation in September.\nPolls from FiveThirtyEight show Democrats steadily gaining support in the generic congressional ballot. Republicans had held a steady lead of roughly 2.3 points from early 2022 to the beginning of July, when Democrats started gaining ground. \nBy Sept. 22, Democrats had taken the lead with 1.9 points, more than a 4-point increase.\n“I do think this issue will be, in the end, the most impactful and decisive issue in this election and I think Republicans were planning on it being about inflation and the economy,” Bonier said. \nThe impacts of the women’s vote will likely stretch beyond the midterms, Bonier predicted, because “i​​f you vote in one election, youre much more likely to vote subsequent elections, so these women wont disappear.”"

    "content": "WASHINGTON  Presidents come and go, but the Supreme Court goes on forever.\nWilliam Howard Taft said that. And he was an authority: he was the 27th president of the United States from 1909 until 1913, then served as the nations 10th chief justice of the Supreme Court from 1921 until 1930. He is the only person to hold both posts.\nTaft, by the way, also was responsible for securing a separate, permanent building for the nations highest court.\nBut what has transpired inside that building over the decades has been the focus of an endless debate among legal scholars, politicians, journalists, voters  and even the justices themselves. Has the court been a force for change or a conservative roadblock against progress? Does the court reflect the tenor of the times or is it hopelessly out of step with the majority of Americans? Is it even proper to ask the court to mirror public opinion?\nWith the high courts overturning of Roe v. Wade earlier this year, the moment seems right to trace the evolution of the Supreme Court, weigh the pressures it is facing now and assess its future. Capital News Service Washington Bureau reporters Hunter Savery and Kate Seltzer are producing a six-part podcast that intends to do just that.\nHere is the first episode of the podcast, titled Takeover.\n\nHow Did We Get Here? | RSS.com"

    "title": "Military sexual assault reports rise ahead of planned reforms",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  Reports of sexual assaults in the military increased 13 percent between fiscal 2020 and 2021, but fewer people came forward to report those assaults, according to the Department of Defense. \nThe Pentagon is working to implement a series of 82 recommendations from the Independent Review Commission on Sexual Assault in the Military, created last year to address a chronic problem that has prompted action by Congress and the Biden administration. \nHiring about 2,000 sexual assault prevention professionals to be stationed globally is a top priority, Gilbert Cisneros, the undersecretary of defense for personnel and readiness, told lawmakers Wednesday. \nCisneros testified before the House Armed Services Committee’s military personnel subcommittee to give lawmakers an update on the implementation of the independent commission’s recommendations. \n“While the numbers are deeply disappointing, they largely reflect the climate before the department began implementation of this historic reform,” Cisneros said during the hearing.\nIn the wake of the findings about increasing assaults in the armed services, Cisneros emphasized the DOD’s commitment to taking steps toward accountability, prevention and support for victims. \nIn the latest survey, 8.4% of active duty women and 1.5% of active duty men reported experiencing some form of unwanted sexual contact that year. That figure for women is the highest recorded to date. \nThe data also showed that 29% of active duty women and 7% of active duty men indicated experiencing sexual harassment in the military. These numbers reflect an increase for women compared to a survey conducted for the previous year and no increase for men overall. \nThe chairwoman of the House subcommittee, Rep. Jackie Speier, D-California, called the latest data “catastrophic news.” \n“The crisis of military sexual assault and harassment continues unabated,” Speier said. \nThe subcommittee’s ranking Republican, Rep. Mike Gallagher of  Wisconsin, said he was worried about leaders not being able to properly respond to sexual violence and burnout among professionals who support victims. \n“This committee needs to know if those leaders are empowered to act or encouraged to take a hands-off approach,” Gallagher said. \nThe DOD’s report found that specialists who respond to sexual assault cases in the military experienced higher rates of burnout, compassion fatigue and vicarious trauma in the 2021 survey compared to a previous survey in 2018. Some of these responders also said COVID-19 restrictions created a challenge in connecting with victims.\n“The prevention workforce is an integral part of what we’re going to do and what we need to in order to gain trust from our service members,” Cisneros said.\nGina Ortiz Jones, under secretary for the Air Force, noted during the hearing that changes to helping victims receive support is key to “basic connectedness” among members of the military. \n“We know the importance of climate and culture and ensuring that we’ve got the right protective factors in place and a lot of this is tied to understanding of unit cohesion,” Ortiz Jones said.\nPresident Joe Biden in January signed an executive order making sexual harassment a crime under the Uniform Code of Military Justice.\nA law passed by Congress last year will take decisions about prosecuting sexual assault cases out of the military chain of command and instead be handled by special trial attorneys. The law takes effect late next year."

    "title": "Monkeypox cases drop, but disease hit Maryland’s Black communities harder",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  New monkeypox cases are continuing to decline in Maryland and the District of Columbia.\nHowever, newly released data from the Maryland Department of Health shows that Monkeypox cases in Maryland are disproportionately affecting Black communities, mirroring national demographic data as health officials grapple with how to slow the spread. \nMost cases of the viral disease are affecting gay men, bisexual men and men who have sex with other men. Individuals of any gender or sexual orientation can contract monkeypox through close personal contact, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Black and Latino individuals are disproportionately affected nationally. \n\nThere are over 22,000 monkeypox cases in the United States and one person has died, according to the CDC. Infection rates have slowed over the past weeks, CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said Wednesday. \n“We approach this news with cautious optimism,” Walensky told lawmakers during a Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee hearing, emphasizing the importance of continuing federal response efforts. \nIn Washington, new cases have declined by an average of 22% every week since peaking on July 17, according to D.C. Health. Peter DeMartino, director of the Maryland Infectious Disease and Health Services Bureau, said that Maryland’s new cases peaked in early August and have continued to decline since then. \n\nDistrict, Maryland and Virginia health officials held nightly meetings to coordinate responses and ensure the validity of their case numbers, given the large number of people who move between these jurisdictions regularly. \nIn spite of the coordination, the approaches from health officials in the District and Maryland took different forms. \nAccording to the District’s State Epidemiologist Anil Mangla, the city’s response was successful because infrastructure was already in place before the first case was detected. The Department of Health had secured vaccines, set up a vaccination registration system and guided the response through behavioral surveys that helped to identify those most at risk of infection. \nMaryland’s approach to the monkeypox outbreak was more community-guided. DeMartino said that the state looked to community organizations in at-risk communities to guide messaging, testing, and vaccine rollout. \nBased on the feedback of at-risk community members, Maryland health officials are not referring to the disease as monkeypox, but instead use the less stigmatizing “MPX.”\nInitially, Maryland also faced the challenge of having far fewer vaccine doses available than neighboring Washington, which was able to administer an average of nearly 1000 per day early in the outbreak. At the beginning of the outbreak, Maryland only had 600 doses available for the whole state.\nIn Washington, the number of confirmed cases is equal for white and Black residents, but in Maryland, significant disparities exist. According to the Maryland Department of Health, of 571 total cases, 57.6% were Black while 16.3% were white.\nAnthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, compared the current outbreak to the first cases of the HIV/AIDS pandemic in his testimony before the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee Wednesday. \n“Lessons learned during the response to AIDS and COVID-19, such as avoiding stigma and ensuring that the medical countermeasures get to where they are needed most, should help us in our efforts to respond to the ongoing monkeypox emergency,” Fauci told lawmakers.\nWalensky, who testified alongside Fauci and other experts, emphasized testing, vaccinations, education and outreach to vulnerable communities as key aspects of the federal government’s response to monkeypox. \nThe CDC announced a new plan Thursday to allow health departments and organizations nationwide to submit requests to obtain monkeypox vaccines. The program is designed to remove barriers to vaccinations, including accessibility, mistrust and stigma.\nDeMartino said the decrease in Maryland’s case numbers is due to vaccines. He also credits educating people about which communities are at higher risk and what behaviors increase chances of exposure. \n“It’s not going to keep me off the dance floor,” said DeMartino, “but I might be wearing long sleeves.”"

    "title": "War in Ukraine, energy concerns prompt new US focus on Central Asia",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  Secretary of State Antony Blinken plans to meet next week with his Central Asian counterparts at the United Nations, a signal of a new focus on the region prompted by the war in Ukraine and concerns over future energy sources.\nThe Central Asian countries  Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan   are the middle ground between China to the east, Russia to the north and Caspian sea to the west. The region has been in the headlines lately, getting   with special attention from China’s President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin, who both met with several of the region’s leaders while visiting Samarkand, Uzbekistan.\nAll five nations were once part of the former Soviet Union.\nThe war in Ukraine forced the Biden administration recalibrate its relations with Russia, and also made the nation’s interests in strengthening relations with Central Asia more relevant, according to Donald Lu, assistant secretary of state for South and Central Asian affairs and former U.S. ambassador to Kyrgyzstan.\nHe said U.S. priorities include guaranteeing territorial integrity, boosting existing trade and establishing permanent trade, as well as addressing counterterrorism and other security concerns.\n“This is a defining moment for the people of Central Asia,” Lu told lawmakers at a hearing Wednesday of the House Foreign Affairs Committee’s Asia, the Pacific, Central Asia and nonproliferation subcommittee. “Russia’s war of aggression in Ukraine has created concerns about sovereignty and territorial integrity in this neighboring region.”\nWhile Moscow’s and Beijing’s presence in the region has been undeniably substantial, when it comes to the U.S. involvement, Central Asia has gotten “less attention than deserved,” Rep. Steve Chabot of Ohio, the top Republican on the subcommittee.\nAccording to the State Department’s current U.S. strategy for Central Asia, the region is “a geostrategic region important to United States national security interests, regardless of the level of United States involvement in Afghanistan.”\nBut Dr. Sebastien Peyrouse, Central Asia Program research professor at The George Washington University’s Elliott School of International Affairs, remains skeptical of U.S. geopolitical ambitions in the region.\n“I’ve heard for years and years the U.S was going to be more involved in the region without actually materializing it,” Peyrouse told Capital News Service in an interview.\n“Central Asia is definitely not a priority for the United States,” Peyrouse said. “Now, again, we have Ukraine, and considering that, the U.S. has an opportunity to be more involved.”\nPeyrouse emphasized that the United States and the European Union need to stop focusing solely on the region’s economies and security, and start paying more attention to high levels of corruption, socio-economic difficulties of the people in the region, as well as their deficient education and healthcare systems.\n“If the United States really wants to counterbalance the influence of China and Russia, the U.S. needs to improve its image there,” Peyrouse said.\nThe United States is involved in discussions about transporting oil from Kazakhstan to international markets, as well as the possibility of getting natural gas out of Turkmenistan through the southern corridor into Europe, according to Lu.\nThe Jackson Vanik amendment to the 1974 Trade Act, which prohibits normal trade relations with any nation that prohibits the emigration of its people, is a roadblock to expanding U.S. trade with Central Asia. Lu said that the State Department supports ending the application of those restrictions against Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan because those nations have met the requirements of the Jackson Vanik amendment.\n“As the United States engages in great power competition with the People’s Republic of China and its partners in despotism   Iran and Russia, Central Asia is poised to be of critical importance in the years ahead,” Chabot said."

    "title": "In Washington, British embassy becomes focus of Queen Elizabeth II tributes",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  Mourners gathered at the British Embassy in Washington Friday to pay respects to Queen Elizabeth II. For many, the queen, who died Thursday, was the only monarch they have ever known.\nSome Washingtonians stopped in front of the embassy during their morning walks, while others made intentional visits. Guests signed a condolence book inside the embassy and left flowers or cards along a Union Jack emblem on Massachusetts Avenue.\nPresident Biden and First Lady Jill Biden left their condolences in the embassy Thursday evening. Biden told reporters Friday that he planned to attend the queen’s funeral but “I don’t know what the details are yet.”\n“I wanted to pay my respects to an icon, a wonderful woman and monarch who I respected all my life,” said Ellen Harmon, 71, of Alexandria, Virginia.\nHarmon said the queen was always popular in her house growing up, and that she identified the queen with her parents.\n“The connection with the country is through the queen, her presence, her speaking out. It’s always her as the center in my mind,” said Juanita Illera, of Alexandria, who visited the embassy with Harmon.\n“Frankly, yesterday was sad for me because it reminded me of my father’s death. Two World War II-era people who suffered and came through and did their best and did good,” Harmon said.\n“I’m here to pay condolences to my queen,” said Mark O’Neill, who grew up in the United States but had a British mother. He said he felt “deeply sad” when he heard of the 96-year-old queen’s death, although he expected it would happen sometime over the next few years.\n“She meant everything. She was brilliant, she was compassionate,” O’Neill said.\nTerri Miracle, who traveled to Washington from Xenia, Ohio, for a wedding, also went to the embassy to pay tribute to Queen Elizabeth II. “She was, is and always will be an inspiration to people around the world,” Miracle said.\nShe brought a small doll with her and put it between the flowers on the Union Jack emblem.\n“Ive had her since I was about eight or 10 years old,” Miracle explained. “Ive taken her everywhere Ive moved. And I thought she should be here to honor Queen Elizabeth.”\nRushad Thomas, of Prince George’s County, Maryland, said he has been a fan of the queen and the royal family since he was in fourth grade, citing his love of history for his vested interest. He wore a “God Save The Queen” t-shirt to leave his condolences.\n\n“I think she really left her mark on the institution,” Thomas said. “The fact that this feudal institution from a thousand years ago survives into the 21st century is largely due to her shepherding of it into the new millennium.”\nThomas visited London for the Queen’s Platinum Jubilee in June, one of her last public appearances.\n“It was great because it was such a big celebration of her life,” Thomas said. “We weren’t anticipating her death, but when she’s that old and she wasn’t able to participate in a lot of the celebrations, it was sort of like a big ‘thank you’ while she was still with us.”\n“In the Black church we call it ‘Giving you your flowers while you are still living,’” Thomas added. “I feel like the Platinum Jubilee was giving her her flowers while she was still living.”\nMourners are invited to visit the embassy and sign the condolence book from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. again on Monday, or sign a virtual condolence book on the royal family’s website, www.royal.uk.\nIsaiah Cummins, a freshman politics major at the Catholic University of America, was one of the early visitors to the embassy. He decided to go to the embassy Thursday afternoon, shortly after he heard the news of the queen’s passing.\nHe said he is thankful to be attending school in the nations capital so he can witness important moments like this.\n“When historical events go down, youre right where it all happens,” Cummins said.\nCapital News Service Washington reporter Courtney Cohn contributed to this report."

    "title": "Biden, other U.S. leaders pay tribute to the late Queen Elizabeth II",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  The death of Queen Elizabeth II Thursday afternoon drew immediate reaction from U.S. leaders.\nPresident Joe Biden cancelled planned remarks on the new COVID-19 vaccine, which had been scheduled for 1:45 p.m. Thursday.\nHe issued a proclamation ordering that all American flags on U.S. government buildings, at military installations and on naval vessels are to be flown at half-staff until sunset on the day of the queens burial. The president also released this statement:\nHer Majesty Queen Elizabeth II was more than a monarch. She defined an era.\nIn a world of constant change, she was a steadying presence and a source of comfort and pride for generations of Britons, including many who have never known their country without her. An enduring admiration for Queen Elizabeth II united people across the Commonwealth. The seven decades of her history-making reign bore witness to an age of unprecedented human advancement and the forward march of human dignity.\nShe was the first British monarch to whom people all around the world could feel a personal and immediate connection  whether they heard her on the radio as a young princess speaking to the children of the United Kingdom, or gathered around their televisions for her coronation, or watched her final Christmas speech or her Platinum Jubilee on their phones. And she, in turn, dedicated her whole life to their service.\nSupported by her beloved Prince Philip for 73 years, Queen Elizabeth II led always with grace, an unwavering commitment to duty, and the incomparable power of her example. She endured the dangers and deprivations of a world war alongside the British people and rallied them during the devastation of a global pandemic to look to better days ahead. Through her dedication to her patronages and charities, she supported causes that uplifted people and expanded opportunity. By showing friendship and respect to newly independent nations around the world, she elevated the cause of liberty and fostered enduring bonds that helped strengthen the Commonwealth, which she loved so deeply, into a community to promote peace and shared values.\nQueen Elizabeth II was a stateswoman of unmatched dignity and constancy who deepened the bedrock Alliance between the United Kingdom and the United States. She helped make our relationship special.\nPresident Joe Biden and First Lady Dr. Jill Biden stand with Queen Elizabeth II in the Grand Corridor of Windsor Castle on June 13, 2021. (Adam Schultz/The White House)\nWe first met the Queen in 1982, traveling to the UK as part of a Senate delegation. And we were honored that she extended her hospitality to us in June 2021 during our first overseas trip as President and First Lady, where she charmed us with her wit, moved us with her kindness, and generously shared with us her wisdom. All told, she met 14 American presidents. She helped Americans commemorate both the anniversary of the founding of Jamestown and the bicentennial of our independence. And she stood in solidarity with the United States during our darkest days after 9/11, when she poignantly reminded us that “Grief is the price we pay for love.”\nIn the years ahead, we look forward to continuing a close friendship with The King and The Queen Consort. Today, the thoughts and prayers of people all across the United States are with the people of the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth in their grief. We send our deepest condolences to the Royal Family, who are not only mourning their Queen, but their dear mother, grandmother, and great-grandmother. Her legacy will loom large in the pages of British history, and in the story of our world.\nX X X X X\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-California, issued a statement saying Americans join the people of the United Kingdom in mourning the sad passing of Queen Elizabeth II.\nOver her seven decades on the throne, Her Majesty was a pillar of leadership in the global arena and a devoted friend of freedom, the speaker continued. On behalf of the United States Congress, I extend our deepest and most sincere condolences to the Royal Family during this sad time.\n“Queen Elizabeth embodied the highest spirit of civic duty: earning the reverence of her people and the respect of the world. Her Majesty capably shepherded the United Kingdom through great turbulence and transition. As the Head of the Commonwealth, she helped advance a new global order of security, prosperity and peace. She took an important step toward hope and healing in 2011, when she made history as the first British monarch to visit Ireland in a century. Under history’s brightest spotlight, Queen Elizabeth offered a masterclass in grace and strength, power and poise. Her extraordinary life and leadership will continue to inspire young women and girls in public service, now and for generations to come.\n“Personally, it was an honor to be on the floor of the House during her historic address to the Congress in 1991 and to welcome her as Speaker on her important visit to the United States in 2007, which deepened the special relationship between our nations, Pelosi said. May it be a comfort to her children, grandchildren, great grandchildren and the entire Royal Family that Americans join them in prayer at this sad time.”\nX X X X X\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, also issued a statement:\n“Today all Americans stand with our great friends across the Atlantic in mourning the passing of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II.\n“Elaine and I extend our deepest sympathies to the Royal Family and to the many millions of people across the United Kingdom, the Commonwealth, and the entire world who have drawn reassurance and inspiration from her historic reign, sterling character, and shining example.\n“For 70 long years, from the aftermath of World War II well into the 21st century, across 15 different Prime Ministers, through great triumphs and great challenges, the Queen’s steady leadership safeguarded the land she loved. Despite spending nearly three quarters of a century as one of the most famous and admired individuals on the planet, the Queen made sure her reign was never really about herself — not her fame, not her feelings, not her personal wants or needs. She guided venerable institutions through modern times using timeless virtues like duty, dignity, and sacrifice. She offered our contemporary world a living master class it needed badly.\n“The decades of Her Majesty’s reign saw an intense deepening of the special relationship and close bond between the United States and the United Kingdom. The Queen who met sitting President Harry S. Truman as a 25-year-old princess and met a dozen more of our Presidents during her reign presided over an historic strengthening of our nations’ alliance that has changed the course of world history for the better.\n“The British people’s loss is the entire world’s loss.

    "title": "Basketball&#8217;s Mo Creek was ensnared in Ukraine war, then helped by a man he barely knew",
    "content": "WASHINGTON – Maurice “Mo” Creek one day was a professional basketball player playing in Ukraine. \nThe next day, he was a civilian in the middle of a war zone.\nIt was Feb. 24, the day Russia invaded Ukraine. Creek was trapped in the city of Mykolaiv trying to figure out a way to get back home to the United States. \n“I didn’t think I would be a part of a war,” Creek said in an interview with Capital News Service. “Never in a million years did I think me going overseas to play basketball, I would be stuck in a war with people that are fighting for their lives.”\nCreek, whose hometown is Oxon Hill, Maryland, played college basketball at Indiana from 2009 to 2013, missing one year due to injury before transferring to The George Washington University in the nation’s capital. In his one season there, he was a Third Team All-Atlantic 10 selection, led the Colonials in points per game and helped propel them to the NCAA Tournament. \nHe then went overseas starting in 2014 to play professional basketball. His journey took him to teams in the Netherlands, Denmark, Germany, Finland, Israel, Romania and two different stints in Ukraine. \nCreek returned to Ukraine for a third time in January to play for MBC Mykolaiv. At the time, the threat of a Russian invasion of Ukraine hovered over daily life, even though many Ukrainians dismissed the possibility of a war. \nCreek’s team, too, downplayed the threat, knowing there had been previous threats of Russian invasions and nothing had happened beyond the conflict raging since 2014 in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine. \n“We had meetings about the situation…and the owner, the coaches, were just basically saying everythings gonna be okay,” Creek recalled. \n“Even though you hear about the speculations of war, you just didnt think it would even actually happen because it didnt happen in the prior years,” he said.\nSome of Creek’s teammates began to flee the country and Creek himself wanted to leave as well.\nBut things were complicated. MBC Mykolaiv had not paid Creek the money he needed to leave and he did not yet have his letter of clearance signed to go play for his new team in Qatar that his agent had helped him get. \nBy the time all that was cleared up and Creek was finally ready to leave for Qatar, it was too late: the war had begun. \nMykolaiv, being near the Black Sea, was one of the first cities targeted by the Russians. Creek was stuck trying to figure a way out of Ukraine as martial law was imposed.\nCreek found himself escaping from time to time to a bomb shelter when the air-raid sirens blared. In the shelter, he was without phone service and, cut off from the outside world, wondering if he was going to get out of Ukraine. \n“When I went in the bomb shelter, I didnt know if I was getting home or not,” Creek said. “I thought I was gonna be stuck in Ukraine for a good little bit until the war was over with.“\nBut Creek had someone watching over him from the United States: retired Army Lt. Colonel Erik Nordberg. \nCreek said he had met Nordberg just once for only a few minutes at a clinic last summer involving the team Sideline Cancer, a team that plays under the auspices of the Griffith Family Foundation to promote pancreatic cancer research.\nNordberg told CNS he checked in on Creek’s situation a lot leading up to the Russian invasion. \nThe day after the opening of the war, Nordberg had come home late from a basketball game and was sitting in his bed when he told himself he had to help Creek.    \n“If I dont do something, if I dont put something together to get this guy out, he might not ever get out,” Nordberg said. “I only met (Creek) for a couple of minutes but he was somebody that was important (and) I could do something to save this guys life. And I was going to do it.”\nSo Nordberg went to work from his office in his Fairfield, Pennsylvania, home with plans to get Creek out of Ukraine.  \nNordberg communicated with Creek through the app Signal, giving updates and other important information.\nNordberg’s first plan involved arranging for a car to pick up Creek and take him to the Ukraine-Moldova border. \nBut the driver never showed. \nNordberg tried to get a driver from Odesa to meet Creek in Mykolaiv. But that driver couldn’t get out of Odesa. \nNext, Nordberg told Creek he should cross a bridge to rendezvous with a ride to neighboring Romania. But the Ukrainians didn’t allow Creek to cross the bridge.\nNordberg spoke on the phone at one point with one of Creek’s assistant coaches in Ukraine. \nBefore that phone call, that assistant coach hadn’t made it a priority to help Creek escape, according to Nordberg.\nBut the conversation with Nordberg changed his mindset.\n“He couldnt believe that somebody in the U.S. was setting up a way to get (Creek) out,” Nordberg said. “I think he understood then that we were serious about it. So then he became a little bit more willing to support and get (Creek) out.” \nOn Feb. 28, Creek called Nordberg, telling him that the assistant coach’s family had a car and was going to use one of the routes Nordberg came up with to get out of Ukraine.\nAnd the plan worked, as Creek and his assistant coach’s family drove west to the Ukraine-Moldova border. \nThe ordeal wasn’t quite over: Creek said he had to wait in the cold for nine hours, in line with thousands of people waiting to cross into Moldova. \nNordberg said he worked with the U.S. consulate in Moldova to help make sure Creek got across when he reached the border. \nAt last, Creek reached the checkpoint and crossed into Moldova. Then he made his way to Romania, where he stayed in a hotel room provided by Project Dynamo, a non-profit  organization originally set up to help evacuate Americans and Afghan allies from Afghanistan that now is helping evacuate American citizens in Ukraine.\nNordberg said he didn’t sleep for five days as he aided Creek in his dangerous exit from Ukraine. Nordberg bought a first-class plane ticket for Creek to get home.\n“I wasnt going to rest until he was home to his family,” Nordberg said. “My mission wasnt complete until he was all the way back.”\nCreek flew from Romania to John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York, and then to Washington Dulles International Airport outside Washington. \nWhen Creek stepped off the plane at Dulles, he was greeted by family, Nordberg, and others. \n“It was like one of the best feelings in the world,” Creek said. “I was so happy to get off that plane, turn the corner and see my mom, my father there, my brothers (and) everyone else there.” \nBack in Ukraine, Mykolaiv is one of the cities that has suffered heavy damage in the war. \nCreek said it’s tragic what’s happened to Mykolaiv. \n“Its not the peaceful place that it once was when I was there,” Creek said. “It’s like a war zone… it’s just bad.”\nBut he offered his support to Ukraine to keep fighting and that he’s praying for them.\nCreek said he’s writing a book about his experience in Ukraine as well as what it’s like to play overseas basketball.\n“A lot of people got these dreams and aspirations of wanting to play professional basketball but a lot of people dont understand what it takes or actually what they have to go through,” Creek said.“I want to give people the real scoop about how this actually is before you go over there and kind of have to figure it out yourself.”\nNordberg said he and Creek plan to call or text each other every year on Feb. 28 to mark the basketball player’s escape from war and to talk about people they have helped during the previous year.\nCreek called Nordberg a “guardian angel” for helping him escape. Nordberg said he just did what he was taught to do by the military. \n“I use what skill sets I had to help (Creek), who was a very special person,” Nordberg said. “Im glad I was at that clinic. And Im glad I met him and was able to help him.”\nAll this happened because of one simple friendly conversation at a basketball clinic. Creek is forever grateful. \n“You never know who you’re going to talk to. You never know who youre gonna have a conversation with,” Creek said. “The dude I had a conversation with that I wasnt even thinking about was the dude that saved my life.”"

    "title": "Millions of dollars raised In Maryland congressional races, but just a couple of real contests",
    "content": "Note: This story has been updated to clarify that Glenn Ivey suspended his 2012 campaign for the 4th District seat.\nWASHINGTON – Candidates in competitive congressional races in Maryland are raising millions ahead of the July 19 primary while Democratic incumbents in what are considered safe seats are using their fundraising power to support the party and its candidates elsewhere, Federal Election Commission filings show.  \nMaryland has just two high-profile House contests this year.\nIn the 4th District, a handful of Democrats are vying in the primary to succeed Rep. Anthony Brown, D-Upper Marlboro, including former Rep. Donna Edwards. A primary victory is tantamount to election in the heavily Democratic district.\nIn the 1st District, Rep. Andy Harris, R-Cockeysville, is running in more competitive territory and appears headed for a serious challenge in November, most likely by well-funded Democrat Heather Mizeur. \nThe stakes for Democrats are high in the midterms. \n“History would tell us to expect Democrats to possibly lose both chambers — definitely lose seats in both,” Candace Turitto, a University of Maryland political science professor, told Capital News Service. “Then you have divided government. Youre kind of putting on the chopping block (President Joe) Bidens entire second-half agenda. He needs congressional action on a lot of things.”\nNine Democrats are vying for the 4th District seat, but only two have shown fundraising prowess. \nEdwards, who represented the district for eight years before losing a Senate bid in 2016, has raised over $625,000 since January 2021. Glenn Ivey, the former Prince George’s County state’s attorney, raised more than $297,000 since January. Ivey entered April with more than $583,000 cash on hand while Edwards has more than $460,000. \nIvey briefly was a candidate against Edwards for the 4th District seat in 2011, but he withdrew hours before the January 2012 deadline to get on the ballot, citing fundraising difficulties. In 2016, Ivey lost to Brown, who is leaving Congress to run for Maryland attorney general. \nFormer Del. Angela Angel was the only other Democratic candidate to file an FEC report. She has raised just over $99,000. \nOf the three Republicans in the GOP primary, Jeff Warner has raised less than $38,000. The two other candidates did not file reports.\nIvey has received endorsements from state lawmakers and is also backed by the American Israel Public Affairs Committee political action committee, which gave him more than $158,000 this cycle. Ivey also loaned his campaign $150,000 in February. \nEdwards has snagged endorsements from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-California, and other lawmakers in the House. Emily’s List, the liberal group that supports female candidates, endorsed Edwards and gave her $5,000 in March.\nHarris has been in the House since 2011 and has occupied what analysts considered a safe Republican seat. \nBut redrawn district lines encouraged a serious challenger in Mizeur, who has outraised the incumbent so far, with a total of more than $1.7 million to Harris’ nearly $1.3 million. But Harris reported more than $1.8 million in cash on hand, while Mizeur reported more than $1.1 million. \nVictory Now, a leadership PAC of Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Maryland, has given Mizeur’s campaign $5,000. Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Kensington gave $5,000, while House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Mechanicsville, gave $4,000 to support Mizeur’s House bid. \nMizeur’s primary opponent, Dave Harden, a former official in the Obama administration, raised close to $333,000. Another Democratic challenger, Malcolm Colombo, raised less than $2,000 and withdrew last month.  \nThe Maryland primary was originally scheduled for June 28 but was moved to July 19 because of delays in the redistricting process.\nA state judge rejected the Democrats’ redistricting map in mid-March, arguing that it was a blatant bid to gerrymander districts in their favor and get rid of the only Republican-held seat in Congress. Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan finally approved a map in late April that increased the number of Republican-leaning areas in Harris’ district. \nThe new map also rendered the 6th District, now held by Rep. David Trone, D-Potomac, more competitive. The Cook Political Report, for example, considers the seat competitive but leaning Democratic. \nThe National Republican Campaign Committee included Trone on its target list this cycle. \nTrone loaned his campaign $2 million in March, according to FEC filings. His personal loan total is more than $2.5 million this cycle. \nThe congressman largely self-funded his unsuccessful 2016 House bid, as well as his winning 2018 and 2020 campaigns.\nTrone is also boosting the party, giving $365,000 to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. His wife, June Trone, gave $95,000 to the DCCC in February.  \nOf Trone’s three Democratic primary challengers, Benjamin Smilowitz raised close to $63,000 by the end of March after spending nearly $28,000 since January. \nOn the GOP side, six candidates are vying for the chance to take on Trone. \nWashington County Del. Neil Parrott, who ran against Trone two years ago, easily leads in fundraising, taking in more than $188,000 this cycle and ending March with nearly $262,000 in cash on hand. Two other Republican candidates in the race, Jonathan Jenkins and David Wallace, collectively raised slightly more than $60,000.  \nSince January, Raskin raised nearly $908,000, bringing his total contributions this midterm election cycle to more than $2.8 million to retain his seat in the 8th District. \nRaskin, who rose to national prominence during impeachment proceedings against former President Donald Trump, has given the DCCC $250,000, FEC records show. He transferred another $100,000 to the committee in March, bringing his total contributions to $350,000. \nIn the 5th District, Hoyer raised over $1.9 million this cycle, including more than $388,000 since January, according to FEC filings. \nHoyer has two primary opponents, but only McKayla Wilkes, a progressive Democratic challenger, filed an FEC report. She raised over $134,000. \nOf seven GOP primary candidates in Hoyer’s district, Republican Christopher Palombi was the only one to file a report with the FEC, and it showed he raised less than $24,000. \nDemocratic incumbents continued to outraise their challengers in the other House districts. \nIn the 3rd District, Rep. John Sarbanes of Towson raised more than $150,000 this cycle, including more than $47,000 since January. His campaign had over $1 million in cash on hand heading into April, according to FEC filings. His four Republican challengers have collectively raised less than $84,000. \nIn the 2nd District, Rep. Dutch Ruppersberger, D-Timonium, raised over $625,000 this cycle. His three other Democratic challengers, including former Baltimore County progressive activist Brittany Oliver, collectively raised over $58,000. \nRepublican candidate Bernard Flowers raised just over $10,000. The other Republican challengers in the race did not submit FEC reports. \nIn the 7th District, Rep. Kweisi Mfume of Baltimore entered April with more than $476,000 million in cash on hand. The former NAACP president raised nearly $287,000 this cycle. Neither of the two other Democratic primary candidates and none of the four GOP candidates filed fundraising reports with the FEC.    \nVan Hollen, running for his second term in the Senate, is far outraising his challengers.\nHis campaign has raised more than $7.6 million this cycle.\nTen Republicans are vying for the opportunity to take on Van Hollen. Only one, James Tarantin, a merchandising company owner, has raised significant sums: just over $164,000. \nThe Cook Political Report rates the seat as solidly Democratic. \nVan Hollen finished March with more than $5.4 million in his warchest. \nVan Hollen’s Victory Now leadership PAC gave $15,000 to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee in March 2021 and another $15,000 in February. \nThe PAC also gave to the campaigns of Democratic Sens. Raphael Warnock in Georgia and Mark Kelly in Arizona, among others in the Senate."

    "title": "In sheer numbers, U.S. and NATO forces far outstrip Russia’s military",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  In the more than two months since Russia invaded Ukraine, Russian President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly threatened the NATO alliance not to interfere. \nIgnoring those warnings, the United States and its NATO allies have supplied Ukraine weapons and intelligence that have been used to great effect.\nAnd in the background, policy makers and subject experts have questioned whether this conflict in Europe represents the beginning of a new Cold War. A central theme of the first Cold War was a race between the United States and NATO on one side and the then-Soviet Union on the other to compile the largest arsenal of weapons.\nWhile war is not solely a game of numbers, having a numerical superiority in firepower is certainly an advantage. So how do the US and NATO forces stack up against those of Russia?\nFrom a purely quantitative point of view  very well: in fact, by all measures Russia is outgunned by the western alliance.\nBelow, five numerical comparisons of military components of the United States, NATO and Russia are represented. The figures are best estimates based on available information. Numbers for the United States are shown both individually and included in the NATO totals.\nMANPOWER\nThe infantry is often referred to as “the queen of battle”  a chess reference recognizing the influence of boots on the ground. But not every soldier is a rifleman; the majority fulfill support roles, making the mobilization of the infantry possible.\n!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var a in e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r=0;r\nThe manpower chart represents the total number of active duty personnel in the military of each force. The NATO alliance has more than three times the personnel Russia fields. The numbers do not factor in reserve or national guard members in each country. \nARMOR\nA mainstay on the battlefield since World War I, main battle tanks have an imposing presence. Combining armor, a suite of weapons and mobility, they are a pillar of modern military strategy.\n!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var a in e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r=0;r\nThe tanks chart represents the total number of main battle tanks in each arsenal, combining the number of vehicles actively fielded and held in storage. Along with tanks, U.S., NATO and Russian forces each have hundreds of thousands of armored fighting vehicles, trucks and support vehicles. \nSEA POWER\nOne of the main ways to project power in a foreign land, a navy allows a nation’s military to project force beyond its borders.\n Aircraft carriers take this to the next level, greatly expanding the reach of sea power. While carriers are extremely visible, submarines operate below the waves in secret. And all are supported by a fleet of vessels ranging from destroyers to tankers carrying fuel.\n!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var a in e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r=0;r\nThe aircraft carrier numbers represent vessels meant to launch either airplanes or helicopters. Submarines come in three types: attack subs meant to target other vessels, subs that can launch conventional cruise missiles, and subs that serve as a mobile launch platform for nuclear warheads. \nAIR POWER\nAir superiority is a dominant factor in the outcome of a battle - and even a war, providing large and pinpoint firepower at a moment’s notice. \nThe absence of Russian air superiority in Ukraine since the invasion has been a hot topic in the news. That shortcoming has hampered Russia’s ability to achieve its early objectives. Russia still has not achieved dominance in the skies over Ukraine.\n!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var a in e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r=0;r\nThe combat aircraft chart shows the number of airplanes and helicopters used for combat. It does not include the transportation and fueling aircraft in the U.S., NATO and Russian fleets.\nWEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION\nThe scariest and most lethal weapons in any country's arsenal, nuclear warheads are considered the very last line of escalation in a conflict.\nAside from the two atomic bombs dropped on Japan by the United States at the end of World War II, nuclear weapons never have been used in subsequent conflicts.\nWith the capability to destroy entire cities within seconds, nuclear warheads primarily serve as a deterrent - a threat to the other side should they be contemplating a first strike.\n!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var a in e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r=0;r\nThe numbers in the nuclear warhead chart show how many warheads are in the U.S., NATO and Russian arsenals. Some warheads are mounted to delivery devices such as intercontinental ballistic missiles and conventional bombs; most are held in storage. \nOnly the United States, the United Kingdom and France possess nuclear weapons in the NATO alliance. \nWhile those three nations currently only have the large, city-destroying weapons, Russia has both the high-yield warheads as well as low-yield warheads, which have a blast radius of a few hundred yards and are easily portable. Experts agree that low-yield devices lower the threshold for use, making their usage much more likely.\n***\nWhat is not revealed by displaying only the numbers is the technology behind the personnel and equipment. \nThe United States, NATO and Russia field updated versions of the weapons they deployed during the Cold War. These weapons were purpose-built to combat the other should a Cold War turn hot.  \nThe numbers displayed in this article do not take into account the equipment Russia currently is losing in Ukraine. Estimates vary, but Russian personnel losses could be as high as 40,000 soldiers.\nUkraine is not a NATO member and while that nation has surprised the world with its fierce resistance to the Russian invasion, the current size and state of its military is not known.\nFinland and Sweden have recently expressed their intent to join NATO in light of the Russian aggression in the region. Both countries are set to make their decisions this month, potentially adding their manpower and arsenals to the alliance’s tally. The move would expand NATO defenses along the Russian border.\nNote: Research for this story is based on readily available public information from government and non-government, non-partisan organizations, as well as international sources and media reporting, including the Center for Strategic and International Studies, NATO and Flight International."

    "content": "WASHINGTON – Associate Justice Samuel Alito’s leaked draft of a potential ruling overturning the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade decision has rocked the nation’s capital and touched off a political uproar. \nThis is the first known incident where a draft Supreme Court decision has been leaked to the public. Chief Justice John Roberts confirmed the documents were authentic in a statement and said he has directed the court’s marshal to investigate the leak. \nRoberts said the leak appears “intended to undermine the integrity of our operations, (and) it will not succeed. The work of the court will not be affected in any way.” \nDemocrats focused on the ramifications of Alitos draft opinion, while Republicans appeared more upset about the consequences of the leak. Supporters of the Roe v. Wade ruling and opponents demonstrated for hours on the sidewalk in front of the Supreme Court  protests that certainly were loud enough for justices to hear in their offices.\nPresident Joe Biden told reporters before a trip to Alabama that “if what is written is what remains, it goes far beyond the concern of whether or not there is the right to choose.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n            \n                                                \n\n                                        \n                        abortion fiveabortion fourabortion nineabortion sevenabortion sixabortion tenabortion threeabortion twovan hollen scotusabortion senatorsabortion elevenabortion eight                    \n\n                                    \n            \n        \n        \n\n“It goes to other basic rights: the right to marry, the right to determine a whole range of things. Because one of the issues that…a number of the members of the court have not acknowledged is that there is a right to privacy in our Constitution,” Biden said. “I strongly believe there is.”\nThe president earlier released a statement saying he would press to pass legislation codifying Roe v. Wade “and it will fall on voters to elect pro-choice officials this November.”\nVice President Kamala Harris said in a statement that “the rights of all Americans are at risk.”\n“If the right to privacy is weakened, every person could face a future in which the government can potentially interfere in the personal decisions you make about your life,” Harris said. “This is the time to fight for women and for our country with everything we have.”\nBut Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, told reporters that the story was the leak, which in Senate floor remarks he called “a shocking new breach.” \n“Somebody, likely somebody inside the court, leaked a confidential internal draft to the press,” the senator charged. “Almost certainly in an effort to stir up an inappropriate pressure campaign to sway an outcome.”\n“Liberals want to rip the blindfold off Lady Justice,” McConnell said. “They want to override impartiality with intimidation. They want to elevate mob rule over the rule of law.”\nRoe v. Wade, which effectively legalized a woman’s right to abortion in the United States, has been challenged at multiple turns by anti-abortion activists. March For Life, an annual event conducted on the decision’s anniversary, has mobilized abortion opponents and capitalized on alliances with GOP politicians to enact state bans. \nPresident Donald Trump’s appointment of three conservative justices  Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, and Amy Coney Barrett  shifted the balance on the court, for the first time putting the nearly 50-year abortion ruling in jeopardy.\nSen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Maryland, spoke to demonstrators in front of the Supreme Court, calling Alito’s draft decision “a wakeup call across the country.”\n“I think that now we are talking about a court decision that could take away a womans right to choose to take away our reproductive freedom and take away the right to a safe and legal abortion,” Van Hollen said in an interview with Capital News Service after his remarks. “I think youre gonna see a huge grassroots response, because for years, this threat has been implicit, but now its very, very real.”\nSen. Ben Cardin, D-Maryland, warned in a statement that “if the draft opinion striking down Roe v. Wade stands, it will put the health, well-being and constitutional rights of women across this nation in great jeopardy.” \n“Should the court continue on this path, people in more than half of the states would immediately lose access to safe, legal abortion,” he said. “Low-income families and those without the means to leave their homes for care in states like Maryland will be the most burdened.”\nProtesters and counter-protesters crowded in front of the Supreme Court building Monday night and most of the day Tuesday. \n“Im hoping to see Justice Alito, his opinion, be not taken and to see all of this dissent thats occurring out here and all of this protest thats occurring, have it really make a difference and really sway the Supreme Courts vote,” said Ellie Small, a George Washington University student from Salem, New Hampshire, and abortion rights supporter.\nMargaret Moerchen, of Washington, also was prompted to join demonstrators.\n“When I read the news last night, I was sad more than anything and that gateway led to anger,” she said. “I dont think this is a government decision. I think its a womans right to decide. And theres a lot of talk about the health of the baby, but no talk about the health of the woman or the child thats born afterward.” \n“Its really hard to process right now,” said Heather Priest, of Los Angeles. “I feel like I saw it coming in 2016 but I was born before Roe v. Wade. I never thought that the women behind me would have fewer rights.” \nBut Savanna Deretich, with the Students for Life of America, supported the apparent direction of the court. \n“We believe all human beings deserve the right to life, no matter what stage your age and the Constitution, abortion is not written in invisible link,” she said. \n“We believe that we should protect human life at all stages. Whereas the pro-abortion side actually has no consistent argument,” Deretich said. “They all say that life begins at different stages. They never have one argument, but we all agree life begins at conception…the other side has, they dont know when life begins.“\nUp to 26 states are expected to outlaw abortion if Roe v. Wade is overturned, according to the Guttmacher Institute, an abortion rights research organization.\nSome Democratic lawmakers and strategists believe overturning Roe v Wade could change the dynamics of the upcoming November midterm elections, in which their party is expected to lose seats in the House and Senate.\n“Republicans are spending all their focus on the leak because they don’t want to focus on Roe v. Wade, where they know they are on the wrong side of history and on the wrong side of the American people,” Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-New York, said at a press conference on the United States Capitol steps, surrounded by a host of Democratic senators.\n“The blame for this decision falls squarely on Senate Republicans, who spent years pushing extremist judges and justices while claiming this day would never come. But come it has,” Schumer said.\nHe said he would press for a Senate vote on legislation that would codify in law the right to an abortion."

    "content": "WASHINGTON – This year’s winner of the triennial Outwin Boochever Portrait Competition at the Smithsonian Institution’s National Portrait Gallery is artist Alison Elizabeth Taylor with her marquetry hybrid work titled “Anthony Cuts Under the Williamsburg Bridge, Morning.” \nAs first-prize winner, Taylor will receive $25,000 cash and a commission to create a portrait of a living individual for the museum’s permanent collection. \n“I was shocked and Im still kind of shocked. But Im very thankful and yeah, just humbled by this whole experience,” Taylor, who is based in Brooklyn, New York, said in an interview with Capital News Service. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n            \n                                                \n\n                                        \n                        IMG_672933240-2copyIMG_672933456copyIMG_672933595copyIMG_672933307copyIMG_672933426copyIMG_672933622copyIMG_672933807copyIMG_672933942copyIMG_672933858copyIMG_672933791copyIMG_672935325copyIMG_672935889copyIMG_672936127copyIMG_672937047copyIMG_672936941IMG_672936225copy                    \n\n                                    \n            \n        \n        \nArtists in various media who are living and working in the United States each were invited to submit a portrait to a panel of experts chosen by the National Portrait Gallery. \nUnder the guidelines of the Outwin Boochever Portrait Competition, artists submit pieces that challenge “traditional definitions of portraiture,” including works of paintings, photography, sculptures and performances and other media, according to the gallery. \nTaylor’s piece in the Outwin exhibit took about a year to complete, she said. \nWASHINGTON  Anthony Cuts Under the Williamsburg Bridge, Morning, by Alison Elizabeth Taylor. (Emily Hahn/Capital News Service)\nTrained as a painter, she said she wanted to create her piece with mixed media including oil painting, photographs and wood dust from sanding. She began her work in May 2020 and completed it in a year. \nWhen describing her subject, roller skater and barber Anthony Payne, Taylor said he had a “beautiful energy.” \nPayne had been doing haircuts on the sidewalk outside his apartment after his salon was shuttered, Taylor said.\nOne day, it started to rain right after he set up and he moved his sidewalk salon under the Williamsburg Bridge. \nMany people in Taylor’s Brooklyn community admired Payne’s resilience and resourcefulness, she said. \n“Its funny when I was photographing and drawing him, sometimes the hair would wrap around my ankles because its really windy under the bridge,” Taylor recalled. “And I was like, wow, that actually feels good. Like you think that if you were in a salon that would be weird, but it felt really comforting and good.” \nAfter telling Payne this, she said he responded, “Yeah, its like the energy of other people. You need that energy right now,” which she found beautiful. \n“The Outwin 2022: American Portraiture Today” is premiering at the National Portrait Gallery on Saturday and will run through Feb. 26, 2023. The exhibit will then travel around the country. \nThis year’s 42 artworks by 43 artists were selected from a pool of more than 2,700 entries, according to the gallery. \n“The other artists in the show are so great, and theyre so talented, and their perspectives and their subjects are so interesting. And its really kind of been amazing and collegial to be together and get to know everybody,” Taylor said. \nVirginia Outwin Boochever, the late benefactor of the portrait competition endowment, worked as a docent at the National Portrait Gallery for nearly two decades. \n“She saw the endowment as a unique opportunity to fill a void in the American art world,” the gallery said on its website."

    "title": "Selection process for new FBI headquarters back on track and Maryland has two sites ",
    "content": "WASHINGTON – The final selection process for a new location for the headquarters of the Federal Bureau of Investigation is back on track after years of delays.\nThe FBI headquarters has been located in the J. Edgar Hoover Building in the nation’s capital since 1974, but the building is deteriorating. Trippy.com in 2012 named the agency’s home the world’s “ugliest” building and in 2005 architect Arthur Cotton Moore said the building “creates a void along Pennsylvania Avenue.” \nTalks between the FBI and the General Services Administration began on a new site for the headquarters during the Bush administration. But more focused efforts got underway during the Obama administration to move the headquarters out of the District of Columbia to what eventually was narrowed down to three potential sites in the suburbs, two in Maryland and one in northern Virginia.\nThe Biden administration has a Sept. 11 deadline for selecting one of the three proposed sites. The new headquarters would house an estimated 7,500 employees. \nSen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Maryland, has been one of the leading lawmakers in getting the headquarters relocated to a new suburban location. However, the Trump administration previously had blocked efforts to move the headquarters out of Washington. \n“We were extremely disappointed when the Trump administration derailed this process for four years,” Van Hollen said in an interview with Capital News Service. “We could have been moving forward to meet the security needs of the FBI… on the plan to consolidate the headquarters in one of these locations.”\nWASHINGTON  Fencing keeps pedestrians safe from repair equipment set up outside the FBI headquarters building in downtown Washington. (Emily Hahn/Capital News Service)\nVan Hollen, who is the chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee’s financial services and general government subcommittee, worked with his Republican counterparts to put language in a recent bipartisan catch-all spending bill passed by Congress to resume the relocation process for the FBI headquarters.\n“I think that senators on both sides of the aisle share a view that we need to provide the FBI with a secure home, and one that allows them to consolidate its operations,” Van Hollen said.\nPresident Joe Biden’s proposed fiscal 2023 budget also includes language providing for a consolidated FBI headquarters in a new location outside the District of Columbia.\n“Over the next year,” the president’s budget states, “GSA and FBI will finalize an updated program of requirements for a secure suburban campus, including the final number of personnel, to inform a 2024 Budget request for the new facility. GSA will also begin initial steps to acquire, if necessary, the site for the new suburban location.”\nThe three potential headquarters sites are in Greenbelt and Landover, Maryland and Springfield, Virginia. \n“I think this is the right move for the FBI and the country,” Van Hollen said. “I think that either of the places in Prince Georges County will put them in a position to consolidate their operations in a secure environment and carry out their duties on behalf of the country.” \nVan Hollen said the two Maryland locations both have access to public transportation, including Metro. Van Hollen also said the greater economic activity would benefit surrounding areas.  \nRep. Gerry Connolly, D-Virginia, backs the Springfield location. \nThe Springfield, Virginia, site is the best option for a new consolidated FBI headquarters and if evaluated on merit would be the clear favorite for this major procurement,” Connolly said in a statement to Capital News Service. \n“Northern Virginia is home to the FBI Academy at Marine Corps Base Quantico and the Central Records Complex in Winchester,” Connolly said. “Additionally, the region boasts the highest concentration of suburban-located Intelligence Community (IC) agency headquarters in the country. Proximity to FBI assets and longstanding IC partners is a key competitive advantage for the site.”\nLike the Maryland locations, the Springfield site is near public transportation.\n“The Springfield site is also at the transportation nexus of Interstate 495 and Interstate 95, the Washington Metro system (and) the Virginia Railway Express, which is slated to add considerable additional capacity in the coming years, and other transit services,” Connolly said. \nWASHINGTON  The FBI headquarters in Washington has been dubbed the worlds ugliest building. (Emily Hahn/Capital News Service)\nBut not all are on board with the proposed idea of a move, including the FBI’s current leadership. The agency wants to keep its headquarters in Washington and even has suggested the idea of having a separate cyber campus. \n“The FBI can more effectively serve the American people from a headquarters located downtown,” the FBI said in a statement to CNS. “Our mission would be enhanced by a consolidated suburban cyber and technology campus within the national capital region to serve as a command center for cyber operations, consolidate the FBI’s existing cyber and technology footprint, and accommodate future growth.”\nThe FBI Agents Association has joined the FBI in voicing its support for keeping the headquarters in Washington. \n“We believe what is best for the mission is for FBI headquarters to remain in Washington, D.C., in close proximity to the Department of Justice and our DOJ counterparts,” association President Brian O’Hare said in a statement to CNS.\nBut local lawmakers disagree.  \n“I dont think that the FBI leadership should be decapitated from the men and women who make up the FBI,” Van Hollen said. “Thats why the legislation says the headquarters needs to move.”\nLike Van Hollen, Connolly dismissed the FBI’s desire to stay in Washington.\n“It’s been known for quite some time that Director (Christopher) Wray doesn’t want to move,” Connolly said. “One director does not get to make this kind of decision, nor does he get to circumvent the law.” \nVan Hollen said the Central Intelligence Agency headquarters located in suburban Langley, Virginia could be an example of what a suburban campus for a new FBI headquarters would look like. The National Security Agency headquarters in Fort George G. Meade, Maryland, is another good model, he said. \n“Those are important models that provide both the opportunity to consolidate operations and also meet the security requirements,” the senator said. \nBiden’s proposed budget does direct the GSA and FBI to find a federally-owned site in the District of Columbia that would be a satellite office for between 750 and 1,000 FBI employees who would be needed for daily contacts with the Justice Department, other parts of the executive branch and Congress.\nThe next step of the process is a GSA briefing by June 13 on the three sites to relevant congressional committees. \n“The U.S. General Services is committed to continuing to support the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to address the FBI’s mission needs, to execute in compliance with congressional direction, and to achieve the best value for the American people,” according to a GSA statement to CNS. \n“In our conversations with the Biden administration, we have urged them to reach a final decision about the actual location,” Van Hollen said. “I hope that they will stay on track but what I am confident about is that this process is going to move forward.”"

    "title": "While Maryland enacts paid family and medical leave, Congress is stalled",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  Maryland earlier this month became the 10th state to create a paid family and medical leave program for workers, but Congress appears no nearer to enacting similar legislation. \nThe closest federal lawmakers came to overhauling family and medical leave policy came last fall, when Democrats sought improvements as part of the Biden administration’s $1.75 trillion social safety net package, also known as the Build Back Better Act. But that legislation stalled, in part because of the inclusion of proposed family and medical leave changes.\nProponents of family and medical leave reforms, including Maryland’s two Democratic senators, are frustrated with the stalemate.\n“For far too long, our nation’s lack of reliable family and medical leave has held our economy back and limited our workforce’s potential,” Sen. Chris Van Hollen told Capital News Service.  “Hard-working Americans deserve to take leave when they are sick or caring for a loved one without worrying about losing their job or making ends meet.”\nVan Hollen added that he was glad to see that the Maryland General Assembly had passed its own Family and Medical Leave Act, and that assorted COVID-19 relief packages had been passed by Congress during the pandemic to temporarily extend family and sick leave, but American families needed a more permanent solution.\nHis colleague, Sen. Ben Cardin, agreed. \n“The U.S. is the only OECD (Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development) country without a paid leave program,” Cardin said. “Clearly, this is not the leadership example we should be setting as a nation.” \nMaryland’s family and medical leave legislation, called the Time to Care Act of 2022, passed April 9 by a supermajority vote in the General Assembly following Gov. Larry Hogan’s veto the previous day. \nMaryland now joins a patchwork of states where leave benefits vary, depending on an employee’s location, choice of profession and the size of the company an employee works for. \nThe limited leave policies in the United States stand in contrast to other nations that have become renowned for their more generous benefits, including paid extended leave and maternity leaves.\nBulgaria leads the world by offering 58.6 weeks of minimum paid maternity leave with a guarantee of job security, according to World Population Review. \nBy contrast, the United States  under the provisions of the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993  currently offers 12 work weeks of leave in a 12-month period to care for a new child, care for a seriously ill family member, or recover from a serious illness. \nUnder the act, “Employees are eligible for leave if they have worked for their employer at least 12 months, at least 1,250 hours over the past 12 months, and work at a location where the company employs 50 or more employees within 75 miles,” according to the Department of Labor.\nThat law has shortcomings, leave advocates say.\n“The Family and Medical Leave Act, or FMLA, remains the only federal law that offers protection for private sector employees who need time away from work to manage their own health or care for a loved one,” said Gayle Goldin, senior advisor to the Department of Labor’s Women’s Bureau. \n“While monumental, the FMLA only guarantees some workers unpaid time away from work,” she said. “Even when eligible for FMLA, many workers cannot afford to take unpaid leave.”\nBut expanding family and medical leave appears to be a reach with Democrats holding a bare majority in the Senate and at least one of their own party opposed to making those benefits part of a broader social safety net bill.   \nI dont think it belongs in the bill, Sen. Joe Manchin, D-West Virginia, said on CNN in November, referring to the leave provisions in last fall’s Build Back Better Act. Thats a piece of legislation that really is needed from the standpoint of if we do it and do it right.\nManchin said he believed the policy could garner bipartisan support if it was done as a stand-alone bill. \nLets get it done in regular order through the process. Itll last. Itll be forever,” Manchin said.\nIn the meantime, the absence of more comprehensive and uniform family and medical leave policies pose a challenge for many families.\nVicky Prosser, 33, of Triangle, Virginia, was a high school Spanish teacher with the Prince William County Public Schools at the time of her second pregnancy. Her husband is in the military and he is changing assignments, requiring them to move.\nOnce the couple moves, Prosser said, “the likelihood of me being at a job for at least 12 months before I have a baby is just not high,” following the birth of her second child. \n“And so its just really frustrating that because I moved with my husband for his military service, I dont get the same benefits for my medical leave after delivering a baby as someone else would,” she said. “So I would love to see that updated to have allowances for military spouses who are having babies.”\nProsser noted that when she became a Spanish teacher with the Prince William County School system and was pregnant with her second child, she had not yet been an employee for 12-months, and did not qualify for family and medical leave act benefits. \n“So, I had to take unpaid leave, and was not guaranteed a job at the end of my maternity leave…the whole thing was just incredibly frustrating,” she said. \nRachel Williams, 35, of Glen Burnie, Maryland, and an employee of the Millipor Sigma pharmaceutical company, said she had a much easier experience with family and medical leave than Prosser, although it was still not without its issues. \n“My company really streamlined the process,” she said, regarding the time off for her pregnancy. “The initial paperwork, basically, my provider filled it out, and submitted it several months in advance. The fact that I got 100% paid for 14 weeks was pretty incredible.”\nWilliams also noted that she previously had worked for a much smaller company, which was following federal guidelines from 2010 and only provided eight weeks of unpaid maternity leave.\nFor Katie Garber, a mother of two from Takoma Park, Maryland, who is a social worker in private practice specializing in care for older adults, her experience was more mixed. \nGarber, who was working for a very small non-profit that didn’t have the required number of employees for federal family and medical leave benefits, said she wound up essentially bargaining for her time off to have her first daughter. \n“They didnt really have to give it to me,” she said. “But I was a valued employee, it was a small office, and my executive director at the time really wanted to set the precedent that they wanted to be family-friendly. So I took the 16 weeks.”\nGarber added that she felt lucky that her job had been held for her while she was on leave. Under a different director managing her, it might have been a different story, she said.\n“At the time, there was no compensation at all,” Garber said. “So, my husband and I went from a two-earner household, you know, basically two adults with two incomes, to three people  two adults and one child income  for several months, which was definitely challenging.” \n“I was so lucky to get the leave the way I did,” she said. “And I dont feel that thats how, especially a federal regulation, should be.”\nIn the case of LGBTQ+ individuals, requests to employers for family and medical leave in states that lack explicit protections can lead to employment discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity, according to the Human Rights Campaign.\n“Some fear the stigma they could face if they reveal the need to take time off for HIV-related care or transgender-specific treatment,” according to the Human Rights Campaign website. “Too many others, especially transgender people of color and those who are low-income, may face other forms of anti-LGBTQ discrimination, housing instability, and violence.” \nThere are often additional obstacles with employers to overcome in the case of LGBTQ+ workers.\n“The challenges faced by workers who request time off from work for medically necessary transition-related health care are significant and painful, ranging from health insurance plans that don’t cover comprehensive trans health care and worries about being outed in the workplace, to flat out harassment,” said Liam Miranda, senior research manager for the Human Rights Campaign. \nThe Biden administration still is advocating for more comprehensive leave coverage.\n“This administration understands the importance of paid family and medical leave to protect workers, especially those from historically marginalized communities,” Women’s Bureau director Wendy Chun-Hoon said. “Studies show that access to paid leave improves child health and well-being, maternal health, families’ economic security, worker retention, labor force participation, and worker productivity and morale.”\nThe House last fall approved expanding leave benefits in the doomed Build Back Better Act. But Manchin’s objections and GOP opposition in the Senate remain.\nSeparate from the Build Back Better Act, legislation to expand leave benefits has been introduced by Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Connecticut, and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-New York. But neither bill has seen any movement.  \n“In Washington, there is never a shortage of competing priorities, so the more visible and vocal in their support that members of the public can be, the better,” Cardin said. “We need everyone to amplify their calls for reform and to communicate this as a priority.”"

    "title": "Federal government moving money-printing facility to Maryland",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  The U.S. Bureau of Engraving and Printing is relocating its currency printing plant from Washington to Beltsville, Maryland, Gov. Larry Hogan announced Wednesday. \nThe new $1.4 billion facility will be on the campus of the former Beltsville Agricultural Research Center. The bureau also prints currency at a plant in Fort Worth, Texas, which opened in 1991 to meet an increase in production demand.\nThe 104-acre Beltsville site once served as the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s largest scientific installation, hosting 17 different research laboratories specializing in subjects from hydrology to animal husbandry. The facility has since been transferred to the Department of Treasury, which oversees the printing of U.S. currency.\n“Over the past three years, the U.S. Bureau of Engraving and Printing and the state of Maryland have worked closely on evaluating the potential for this Beltsville facility and determining how we can best work together to make this project successful,” Hogan said in a statement. “Learning that the land has been transferred is another step in the right direction for moving this project forward.”\nThe facility will be used to print new paper currency along with other secure federal documents. About 40 percent of U.S. paper currency currently is printed in Washington.\nThe construction of the facility will be managed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ Baltimore District and is slated to be completed by early 2027. Once operational, it is expected to employ at least 850 on-site workers and an additional 600 remote employees. \nThe current facility set to be replaced is located between 14th and 15th Streets, N.W., just south of the Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington. Money has been printed at that plant since 1914 and has been a popular tourist attraction.\nHogan said the federal, state and county governments will work together to improve several intersections near the planned Beltsville facility to alleviate traffic congestion on commuting routes, including Maryland Route 201, the Baltimore-Washington Parkway and Powder Mill Road.\nAccording to the Maryland Department of Commerce, the relocation will shorten the commute for the 65 percent of Bureau of Engraving and Printing employees who currently live in Maryland. \n“More than 60 federal agencies call Maryland home, along with dozens of military facilities and federal research and development labs,” Maryland Commerce Secretary Mike Gill said in a statement. “This Beltsville site will provide the convenience the BEP needs to increase its production and advance its manufacturing process, while providing a quality workplace for its employees.”\nMaryland also is being considered for the new home of the FBI’s headquarters. There are three proposed sites: in Greenbelt and Landover, Maryland, and in Springfield, Virginia. \nFort George G. Meade, a U.S. Army installation located in Anne Arundel County, Maryland, is home of the United States Cyber Command and the National Security Agency. \nThe Secret Service, which is charged with policing U.S currency, has a training site adjacent to the Beltsville Agricultural Research Facility.\nThe Food and Drug Administration has a sprawling campus in Silver Spring, Maryland, while the National Institutes of Health is headquartered in a complex in Bethesda, Maryland, and the National Archives and Records Administration operates a massive facility in College Park, Maryland. \n“We take pride in knowing Prince George’s County will be one of only two locations in the country where U.S. currency is printed,” David Iannucci, president of the Prince George’s County Economic Development Corporation, said in a statement. “Increasing the number of federal jobs, and federal investment, in the county have long been a key part of our strategic focus for growing the county’s economy.”"

    "title": "House tries again on federal law to protect journalists and sources",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  Members of Congress have tried for five decades to craft a federal law that would protect journalists from revealing confidential sources  and they are trying again. \nThe latest proposed shield law, called the Protect Reporters from Exploitative State Spying (PRESS) Act, is sponsored by Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Rockville, Rep. John Yarmuth, D-Kentucky, and Rep. Ted Lieu, D-California. It passed the House Judiciary Committee unanimously on April 6. \n“Without a federal shield law, we render reporters and journalists vulnerable to threats of prosecution or jail time simply for doing their jobs,” Raskin said in a statement to Capital News Service. “I introduced the PRESS Act to make good on the constitutional promise of a free press, and I look forward to the bill moving for a vote before the full House of Representatives.”\nShield laws protect journalists in legal proceedings from revealing their sources of information acquired during the reporting process. Reporters sometimes use confidential sources to obtain important information that would otherwise not be publicly available. \nEfforts to pass a federal shield law date to the 1970s and have involved some prominent lawmakers  among them then-Rep. Mike Pence, R-Indiana, the late Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, and the late Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Indiana  but all have ended in failure.\nRaskin previously sponsored a shield bill in 2017. The measure was based on one Pence proposed a decade earlier.\nSen. Ron Wyden, D-Oregon, last year introduced a version of Raskin’s bill but so far it has not had a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing. \nKevin Goldberg, an attorney and First Amendment specialist at the Freedom Forum, told CNS he remains skeptical that the latest legislation will pass the Senate. \nGoldberg noted that the Free Flow of Information Act, a predecessor to the current bill, passed the House by voice vote on Mar. 31, 2009, but never left the Senate.\n“This time around I am hopeful that it can pass because from what Ive seen, Raskin has taken steps to address some of the usual concerns involved here,” Goldberg said.\nOpponents of previous shield law proposals raised concerns over language regarding exceptions in situations where journalists gathered confidential information concerning national security, terrorism, or the potential loss of life. \nGoldberg said the PRESS Act is “slightly narrower” than previous legislation and includes limited exceptions in which the qualified privilege would be waived for journalists. \nReporters still would be compelled to disclose information necessary “to prevent, or to identify any perpetrator of, an act of terrorism against the United States” and “to prevent a threat of imminent violence, significant bodily harm, or death,” according to the text of the legislation. \nShield laws not only protect journalists from revealing sources during legal proceedings but also ensure that the press doesnt become an investigative arm of the government, according to Gabe Rottman, director of the Technology and Press Freedom Project for the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press (RCFP).\nHe told CNS that shield laws were “crucially important for the free flow of information.”\n“If sources are concerned that speaking to a reporter will subject them to investigative scrutiny, they won’t talk to reporters and then the public loses out on newsworthy information in the public interest,” Rottman said.\nYarmuth, the chairman of the House Budget Committee, has more familiarity with the inner workings of journalism than many of his colleagues in Congress. He founded the Louisville Eccentric Observer (LEO) in 1990 and was a columnist there for 16 years.\n“As the first Society of Professional Journalists member to be elected to Congress, I know how important it is that we protect journalists and their ability to speak truth to power without fear of retaliation or retribution,” Yarmuth said in a statement. \nForty-nine states and the District of Columbia have shield laws in place to protect journalists. \nGoldberg noted that even if all 50 states had shield laws, without federal protection, a reporter’s promise of confidentiality cannot be guaranteed.\n“You could be in a state like Maryland that has the oldest and one of the strongest shield laws, but if you end up in federal court, that goes away, it doesnt apply, because Maryland law only applies in the state of Maryland courts,” he said.  \n“Nobody loves to use confidential sources,” Goldberg added. “When (reporters) do, it’s because the public is truly benefiting from the information that is being obtained.”\nThe Society for Professional Journalists is one of the media advocacy organizations that has endorsed the legislation. \n“The Society of Professional Journalists applauds the House Judiciary Committee that voted unanimously to pass the PRESS Act,” said SPJ President Rebecca Aguilar in a statement to CNS.\nAguilar added: “Journalists are one step closer to doing their jobs, knowing the federal government cannot force them to reveal their confidential sources or research documents. The goal of all journalists is to seek the truth without obstacles that can prevent us from doing so.\nThe reporter’s privilege, similar to doctor-patient privilege and the attorney-client privilege, is widely recognized as critical for a functional press, Goldberg said.\n“Privileges exist under law…because somebody has made the recognition that the flow of information between two people is so fundamentally important to those people, to those relationships, and to society at large,” he said. “It is instantly recognizable as to why they exist and why theyre important. There is a good case to be made that the reporters relationship is that valuable to society that we need to protect it.”"

    "title": "Protesters rally at Supreme Court as justices ponder &#8216;remain in Mexico&#8217; policy",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  Protesters rallied outside the Supreme Court on Tuesday as justices heard arguments over eliminating the Trump-era border policy that has kept migrants in Mexico while waiting for their asylum hearings.\nAt issue before the nation’s highest court is the extent of the Biden administration’s authority to change federal immigration policy. The administration plans to end the so-called “remain in Mexico” policy next month, reversing a 2019 decision by then-President Donald Trump to stop asylum-seekers at the southern border from entering the United States.\n“This policy does not protect people from seeking asylum. Instead, it puts people seeking refuge and protection in more danger,” Ray Rodríguez, who was forced to wait in Mexico for 10 months, told the rally.\n“Seeking asylum is a human right,” Rodríguez said. “No human should be forced to remain in danger in Mexico while waiting for asylum claims. (The policy) must end now.”\nThe protest, which organizers called the “Safe Not Stranded” rally, was backed by over 60 immigration advocacy groups including the Catholic Legal Immigration Network, the American Immigration Council, the Justice Action Center and FWD.us.\n“Today is a big day,” Tania Guerrero, immigration attorney at the Catholic Legal Immigration Network, told Capital News Service. “We rallied in front of the Supreme Court in hopes that society at large, but specifically people related to this case, will listen, and how horribly inhumane and unjust ‘remain in Mexico’ policy is.”\nGuerrero said she worked at the southern border for two years to help asylum-seekers seek protection. She said the “horrors” she saw “will always be with me.”\n“I honestly feel very overwhelmed and terrified,” Guerrero said. “Theres people that are decision makers, that are not respecting the rule of law, its just purely overwhelming.”\nAt the morning protest, where those affected by the policy and attorneys representing asylum-seekers spoke, people wore orange t-shirts, carried flowers and waved signs that said “#SafeNotStranded.”\n“‘Safe not stranded’ means that they are going to be given equal justice and they’re going to be allowed to remain in this country without being placed back into the hands of danger,” said Allen Morris, a policy and government affairs strategist for RAICES (the Refugee and Immigrant Center for Education and Legal Services) Texas, a nonprofit agency that provides low-cost legal services to immigrant families.\n“My hope is that the highest court of the land can see everything for what it is and can see that this is something that has to end and they can make the overall call for it,” Morris said. “And unfortunately, the bureaucracy of what that looks like is still very tainted and damaged and rooted in racism.”\nJane Bentrott, a lawyer at Justice Action Center, said she doesn’t think the “remain in Mexico” policy has gotten enough public attention.\n“What the court decides on these issues that they discussed today will have a really, really important effect, both for immigrants rights, and also the potential for future presidents to enact the policies that the voters supported and in elections,” Bentrott said.\nBentrott added that there are broad ramifications of keeping or changing the policy.\n“This can have tremendous foreign policy implications, tremendous implications for democratic accountability and it will have huge implications for the safety and welfare of those humans who are seeking asylum,” Bentrott said."

    "title": "Already OK on passports, &#8220;X&#8221; gender option is expanding to other documents",
    "content": "WASHINGTON – This month travelers for the first time had the option to select “X” in the gender indicator on passports and that designation is expanding as a choice on a variety of federal documents under initiatives by the Biden administration.\nThe changes come as many states and some airlines have taken steps to allow the “X” gender marker for non-binary, intersex and gender non-conforming people on an array of documents  moves championed for years by LGBTQ+ rights advocates.\nBeginning April 11, the State Department accepted “X” gender markers on passport applications. Other department-issued citizenship documents will have the same option late next year.\nThe White House said on March 31 that, in addition to the passport changes, the Department of Homeland Security was changing its Trusted Traveler and TSA PreCheck programs to include “X” gender markers. That agency also has been working with airlines to broaden the use of the designation in ticketing passengers. \nUnited Airlines and American Airlines already use the designation and Delta Air Lines announced earlier this month that it would make the option available for bookings later this year. \nThe Transportation Security Administration in February stopped using passengers’ genders when checking identification at airports.\nWhile Social Security cards do not include any gender designation, the Social Security Administration in February said it would accept “X” gender designations on documents used to apply for Social Security numbers and replacement cards.       \n“X” gender designations also are being incorporated in employment discrimination complaints filed with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, applications for federal student aid and even the visitor processing system at the White House. \nSarah Warbelow, legal director for the Human Rights Campaign, told Capital News Service that the “X” gender marker on passports is “a measure that’s overdue.” She added that it is important that all forms of identity documents, both at the state and federal level, reflect people’s gender identity. \n“So if youre able to have an X marker on your passport, but you cant on your license, or you cant on your Social Security documents that it causes, both headaches for people but also potential safety problems as well,” Warbelow said. \nWarbelow said the Human Rights Campaign has been advocating for the shift to X gender markers in its Blueprint for Positive Change, a roadmap for proposed federal government policy changes on LGBTQ+ issues.\nThe Human Rights Campaign says use of the “X” gender marker is not consistent among the states.\nThirteen states have gender marker updates on only driver’s licenses and 23 have the update on both birth certificates and driver’s licenses. \n“This is not just a federal issue, but a state issue as well,” Warbelow said. “We need to have a robust uptake of the X gender marker across the board.” \nThe United States is not the only country that has adopted the “X” gender marker on passports. At least 15 countries including Argentina, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Germany, Denmark, Iceland, Ireland, Malta, the Netherlands have already adopted the marker. \n“It is unfortunate when we are reminded that the United States is not on the forefront of acceptance and diversity,” said Darren Vance, executive director at Rainbow Families, a non-profit focused on supporting and educating the LGBTQ+ community in Washington.\nThe United States has been accepting passports from other countries that have had “X” gender markers on them for over a decade, Warbelow said. \n“It is always helpful to point to other jurisdictions that have done the same thing and demonstrated that its common sense and doesnt have any unintended consequences,” she said. “And the fact that these other countries have been doing it for so long, you know, just shows that we are really behind the eight ball on this.”\nVance said the “X” gender marker is an “incredible step towards recognizing gender diversity.”\n“I think about how a cisgender man would feel if they were to apply for a passport and the only option was female,” Vance said in an interview with CNS. “And how disempowering and disaffirming that would feel…And gender-affirming recognition is associated with a tremendous reduction in psychological distress and suicidal thoughts.”\n“These small victories are absolutely significant and important and worth celebrating,” Vance said, “which is vital for affirming all people in our society who deserve the right to be represented for who they are.”"

    "title": "Republican lawmakers across the nation are attacking LGBTQ+ rights",
    "content": "WASHINGTON – In Florida, Gov. Ron DeSantis last month signed into law a bill that would prevent LGBTQ+ discussions in schools and will discourage classroom conversation about gender identity and sexual orientation in primary grade levels.\nThe measure, nicknamed by critics the “Don’t Say Gay” bill, drew condemnation from the Walt Disney Co., was labeled as “discriminatory” and “a form of bullying” by the White House, and prompted calls from some in the film industry to boycott making movies in Florida.\nBut Florida is just one of many states where Republicans have proposed measures aimed at curbing LGBTQ+ rights. In 2021 there was a flurry of anti-LGBTQ legislation, making it the worst year since 2015 for anti-LGBTQ legislation, according to the Human Rights Campaign. \nLast year, 17 anti-LGBTQ bills passed in state legislatures in Alabama, Arkansas, Mississippi, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Tennessee and West Virginia.\n“Theres no doubt that this (Florida law) is the tip of the iceberg at stripping away rights for LGBTQ people and for LGBTQ families,” said Darren Vance, executive director at Rainbow Families, a non-profit focused on supporting and educating the LQBTQ community in Washington. \nVance is a part of the LGBTQ+ community, along with his 17-year-old son who identifies as queer. He said the Florida statute is more destructive and far-reaching than many understand.\n“Jumping to the most horrific end is it will increase LGBTQ youth suicide. Like thats it, thats the bottom line,” Vance said.\nCongressional Republicans defended Florida’s new law.\n“What I think we got to make sure our teachers are focused on (is) reading, writing, arithmetic and that’s what they ought to be doing,” Sen. Rick Scott, R-Florida, told CNS.\nBut congressional Democrats said the Florida bill was too broad and could cause parents to file lawsuits. \nSen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Maryland, said that schools should provide a “productive, nurturing learning environment” for students regardless of their backgrounds, race, gender identity or sexual orientation.\n“This bill not only isolates LGBTQ students but also denies all students comprehensive and inclusive education,” Van Hollen told CNS. “I will keep fighting to ensure schools are welcoming of all students, while working to pass the Equality Act to ensure LGBTQ Americans are afforded equal rights under the law.” \nThe Equality Act prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex, sexual orientation and gender identity in employment, housing, accommodations and education. It passed the House is February of last year but has not moved in the Senate.\nMeanwhile, GOP efforts to curb LGBTQ+ rights continue to spread as the 2022 midterm elections approach.\nIn February, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican, sent a directive to state health agencies stating that delivering gender-affirming medical treatments to transgender youths is considered child abuse under Texas law. The order requires medical professionals and teachers to report parents who aid their children in receiving this care.\nThe Biden administration may challenge Abbott’s directive.\n“HHS will take immediate action if needed (in Texas),” Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra said in a statement last month. “I know that many youth and their supportive families are feeling scared and isolated because of these attacks. HHS is closely monitoring the situation in Texas, and will use every tool at our disposal to keep Texans safe.”\nMeanwhile, some of the Republican Party’s candidates falsely are accusing Democrats of being part of an effort to “groom” young people to become gay or transgender.\nIn Michigan, Republican State Sen. Lana Theis attacked Democratic State Sen. Mallory McMorrow in a fundraising letter, claiming that the latter wanted to “groom and sexualize kindergarteners.”\nMcMorrow’s outraged response delivered in the Michigan Senate has gone viral.\n“Call me whatever you want. I know who I am,” the Democrat said. “I know what faith and service mean, and what it calls for in this moment. We will not let hate win.”\nCathryn Oakley, the state legislative director and senior counsel at the Human Rights Campaign, said she has seen an increase in anti-LQBTQ+ legislation in the past few years. \n“You know, legislation often moves in sort of trends around the country,” Oakley said. “And part of that is because the vast majority of the anti-LGBTQ legislation that is introduced in state legislatures comes from the same sources.”\nTania Cordova, an advocate for Casa Ruby, the only LGBTQ bilingual and multicultural organization in Washington, knows what it means to be discriminated against due to a lack of resources, Cordova said. \n“I think that when I was a kid, I couldnt express myself because there was not education about gender identity. And I mean, whos going to determine how youre going to identify yourself?” Cordova said. \nCordova said she now empowers children who may not be able to empower themselves.   \n“We feel suffering from oppression and discrimination, but at least now we have to empower ourselves to be the advocates for those little ones who sometimes dont have the voice to defend themselves,” Cordova said."

    "title": "From bedding to pierogies, Baltimore church sends aid to embattled Ukraine",
    "content": "BALTIMORE –  Gathered in the St. Michael the Archangel Ukrainian Catholic Church here, families, friends and volunteers dedicate their time to supporting the embattled people of Ukraine.\nDuring two months of war, the need for humanitarian aid in Ukraine has been extreme. \nAbout two weeks after Russian forces invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, the church here began taking donations of everything from bedding to toiletries to ramen noodles. These donations then were sent to the Archdiocese of Philadelphia, which has direct contact with counterparts in Ukraine, according to Ihor Remsky, a church trustee. \nAlong with donation drives, the church has hosted monthly fundraisers where parishioners and volunteers make, package, and sell traditional Ukrainian foods such as pierogies, stuffed cabbage and sauerkraut to anyone interested. Last month, all of the proceeds went towards aiding Ukraine. Fundraisers for the next couple of months are still in the discussion stage.\nOverall, the church so far has brought in over $100,000 in donations, and that tally was as of about a month ago, Remsky said. \nAs the St. Michael’s people work, they think about those in Ukraine undergoing daily bombardments and possibly facing Russian troops.\n“This man has to be stopped,” Remsky told Capital News Service, referring to Russian President Vladimir Putin. “At some point in the future, he will have to answer what hes doing. If it’s not to the people of this earth, then to the Lord above.”\nIn the basement of the hall where many churchgoers congregate after Sunday Mass, people old and young moved in synchronicity as they prepared pierogies to be distributed a fundraiser held earlier this month. \nWomen in hairnets left the kitchen and placed metal trays on a table covered with a red cloth. Three elderly women and one man sat hunched over the table eager to pinch the pre-stuffed and perfectly arranged pierogies so they would be ready for baking. \nTwo of the women at the table were sisters: Olha Sushko, who is turning 90 this month, and Irene Traska, 11 years younger. They emigrated from Ukraine to the United States in 1949. \nOlha Sushko (left) and Irene Traska, who came from Ukraine to the United States in 1949, prepare pierogies for a fundraiser for Ukraine at St. Michael the Archangel Ukrainian Catholic Church. (Devin Rank/Capital News Service)\nTraska explained that most of her relatives are from western Ukraine and were doing well. \n“So far, so good,” Traska said. “You have refugees from everywhere, and of course, the refugees from the east are the ones that lost everything.”\nJohn Wojtowycz, another church trustee, was born in the United States, but his parents emigrated from Ukraine in 1948. Wojtowycz still has relatives living in Ukraine \n“My dream is that Ukraine can go back to being peaceful. Go back to raising their children, go back to the fields…The dream is to go back to being a peaceful nation and have Putin take his foot off our throats,” Wojtowycz said. \nRemsky was raised in the church community and is a very active volunteer in the church’s fundraisers. Remsky said that many of the people who purchase food from the fundraiser are not from the church. \n“I had a woman ask me, ‘Is it all homemade?’ I said, ‘Yes maam. It is. Everything here is homemade except for the eggs. We havent figured that out,’” Remsky said. \nRemsky grew up two blocks from the original church that was on Wall Street and spent many of his days playing baseball in Patterson Park, which sits across from the current location of the church on Eastern Avenue. \nThe church is a tight-knit community that has been a generational meeting place for families who have attended and volunteered there for years, including Remsky’s family. \nOnce World War II ended, Remsky’s parents decided to go to the United States to start a new life. They had been taken from Ukraine as teens by the Germans for forced labor, he said. \nOn August 11, 1951, Remsky’s parents immigrated to the United States from Germany. They had a sponsor located in the United States who guided them through their new experiences after they arrived in Philadelphia.\nRemsky’s parents eventually settled in Baltimore. Remsky was born in November 1953.\nRemsky climbed the ladder at Clendenin Brothers Inc., a Baltimore building products company, where he eventually became the plant manager with many people working under him. Remsky is now retired.\nThough he was not born in Ukraine, Remsky has many relatives who live there and are suffering the effects of the Russian invasion.\nFive of his cousins are located in a small village in western Ukraine, close to Lviv and about 200 miles from Kyiv. Facebook Messenger is the only way Remsky has been able to communicate with them. \nRemsky’s cousins have heard some bombs go off but they fortunately have not experienced any injuries or major damage from the attacks.\nOne of Remsky’s cousins is a truck driver who has been delivering humanitarian aid from the western part of Ukraine to the eastern part.\nThe ornate interior of St. Michael the Archangel Ukrainian Catholic Church. (Devin Rank/Capital News Service)\nRemsky’s second cousin, Oksana, left her home country for safety in Poland earlier this month. Remsky remembers her telling of a missile attack on her village that left the sky looking as if it was on fire, he said. \nThe missiles were intercepted, but in the process, there was damage to the surrounding area where she was located, according to Remsky. \nThat was the breaking point for Oksana, who packed up important documents and clothes and, with her 13-year-old son, left their lives in Ukraine and crossed into Poland. Oksana’s 17-year-old son remained in Ukraine with his grandmother, Remsky’s first cousin, to take care of the livestock. \n“I was telling my wife… I couldnt even begin to… I dont know how I would handle this. I honestly dont,” Remsky said. \nRemsky recently sent the 13-year-old boy an old Andriy Shevchenko soccer jersey that he bought many years ago. Shevchenko used to play for the Ukrainian soccer team but now is the manager of the team. Remsky said he hopes to hear from the youth soon. \nWhile working at a local market in Ukraine, his elderly first cousin sleeps every night in the cellar to protect herself from any possible attacks.\nThe general mindset of most of Remsky’s relatives, he said, is that they are not going to leave Ukraine because it is their home.\n“I spoke with my one cousin, and theyre going to win…thats their mindset,” Remsky said. “Were not going to lose this. Were not going back to what we dealt with in the previous seven or eight decades. Its not happening anymore.”"

    "title": "After House approval of bill legalizing marijuana nationwide, attention turns to Senate",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  The House earlier this month passed a bill legalizing marijuana nationwide, and now the focus shifts to the Senate to see if the Democratic majority passes similar legislation. \nThe House bill was approved on April 1 by a 220-204 margin, with three Republicans voting in favor and two Democrats voting against it. The action marks the second time the House has passed legislation legalizing marijuana across the country. \nIn an April 5 press conference, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-New York, said that he hopes to bring up comprehensive marijuana reform towards the end of this month. \nSchumer also said he was talking with Democratic Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Ron Wyden of Oregon, as well as a few Republicans, to see what they want in potential legislation. \nBut the likelihood of the Senate passing comprehensive legislation is low, according to Morgan Fox, political director of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML).\n“Cannabis (support) is not universal, even among Democrats, let alone Republicans, who tend to lag much farther behind on this particular issue,” Fox told Capital News Service. “As of now, there hasn’t really been any substantive conversation about comprehensive cannabis policy reform at all in the Senate.”\nNORML is one of several marijuana advocacy organizations that have been active on Capitol Hill supporting federal cannabis legislation. \nFox believes that the Senate will prove a tougher challenge than the House because many senators are older than their House counterparts and have a generational prejudice against marijuana.\n“The average age of the Senate falls within the age demographic that polling has shown to be the least supportive of cannabis policy reform or legalization,” Fox explained. “A lot of that is because of generational education…Its really just a matter of educating senators and their staff about the issue and providing them with the most up-to-date data and information about how states are successfully regulating cannabis.”\nChris Lindsey, director of Government Relations for the Marijuana Policy Project, agreed. \n“We have a large majority of both Republican and Democratic voters who support legalization,” he told CNS. “Lawmakers tend to be some of the last people to get the memo on this. It happens at the state level as well, its just happening on a larger scale at the federal level.”\nAnother potential roadblock to passing marijuana legalization, according to Lindsey, is the hyper-partisan environment in the Senate. \n“The challenge with proposals that have been put forward is getting the bipartisanship needed for their passage,” he said.\n“For instance, there are legalization bills that have been put forth by Republicans. Its not very likely we will see a lot of Democrats signing on,” Lindsey said. “It doesnt mean that they dont like legalization, it just means we live in a really partisan environment that factors how much support you get on these bills.”\nRep. Dave Joyce, R-Ohio, was among those who voted against the House bill.\n“By failing to establish a regulatory framework upon ending federal prohibition, targeting expungement relief to individuals with federal records, and further polarizing this issue rather than building the foundation necessary for bipartisan buy-in, the MORE Act is a messaging bill at best and at worst, irresponsible,” he wrote in an op-ed for Marijuana Moment.\nThe office of Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Maryland, said that “the senator looks forward to reviewing the legislation when it comes under consideration in the Senate…”\nThe office of Sen. Ben Cardin, D-Maryland, did not respond to a request for comment.\nPresident Joe Biden has stopped short of supporting legalizing marijuana at the federal level. As a candidate, he said marijuana should be decriminalized and criminal records for marijuana possession should be expunged.\nThe powerful American Medical Association is among the opponents who have cautioned against legalizing marijuana.\n“The science about the benefits of cannabis is limited, while the available evidence demonstrates that legalizing the adult use of cannabis poses a threat to public health,” former AMA President Dr. Susan Bailey wrote on the organization’s website a year ago. “Our AMA does not support legalization of cannabis for adult use until additional scientific research has been completed to fully document the public health, medical and economic consequences of its use.”\nEven so, better than two out of three Americans  68 percent  support legalizing marijuana, according to a November Gallup poll.\nIn the past decade, 18 states have legalized cannabis for recreational use, which is still considered a Schedule I substance by the federal government. Thirty-seven states have legalized cannabis for medical purposes.\nMaryland voters will decide in November whether cannabis should be legalized for recreational use.\nIf the Senate ended up passing comprehensive marijuana legislation, it would not change any state laws regarding cannabis regulation, Fox said. This means that states that restrict cannabis could continue to do so. \nHowever, federal legislation could remove cannabis from being considered a Schedule I Controlled Substance, which is defined by the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) as drugs with “no currently accepted medical use” and “a high potential for abuse,” including heroin and ecstasy.\n“I expect that there will still be a handful of states that continue prohibition well into the future, unfortunately,” Fox said. “But, when they start seeing law enforcement and public health savings, job creation and tax revenue, and social justice benefits, I would hope that those states will start fast-tracking legislation for modern cannabis regulation.”"

    "title": "At clinics, patient escorts are low-profile figures on the front lines of abortion debate",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  Construction equipment clanged and hummed over the sound of protesters prayers and shouting of obscenities at passersby and patients outside Planned Parenthood Carol Whitehill Moses Center in the nation’s capital.\nSuch scenes are common around abortion clinics throughout the metropolitan region and the nation.\nPatients at clinics in the District of Columbia, Maryland and Virginia are escorted in and out by volunteers with the Washington Area Clinic Defense Task Force (WACDTF) shielding them from anti-abortion protesters outside the facilities. \nThe escorts are lower-profile figures in the ongoing national debate over abortion. \n“I would like to point out that we are protecting freedom of speech. I mean, we are not there to counter them,” said Megan, a WACDTF volunteer trainer who asked that her last name be withheld because she was concerned for her safety. “They can stand there and say whatever they want, and were not getting in …were not shutting them down. We are there for the patients.” \nWACDTF was created in the 1980s to create a “peaceful and reassuring presence for patients, their companions, and staff” through volunteer work, according to the group’s website. The clinics invite the volunteers to escort and aid patients.\nThe group volunteers at clinics in Maryland, Virginia and Washington. There are similar patient escort groups around the country.\n\nWASHINGTON  Founder and executive director of Progressive Anti-Abortion Uprising (PAAU) Terrisa Bukovinae shouts at passersby in front of NoMa Planned Parenthood in Washington, D.C. (Emily Hahn/Capital News Service)\nA federal law, called the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances (FACE) Act, passed in 1994, allows protesters at abortion clinics on public property. \nA 2014 U.S. Supreme Court ruling set a precedent that a buffer zone on public sidewalks is a violation of First Amendment rights and thus unconstitutional. \nAs a result, the atmosphere around abortion clinics sometimes can feel confrontational. \nAnti-abortion protesters sometimes approach the patient escorts, but the escorts are trained to ignore them and not engage. \nWhen protesters do confront volunteers, they have been called murderers, or baby killers or told they are lacking morality, according to clinic escorts. Some volunteers have been told they are going to Hell, aiding Satan or guarding the gates of Hell, said Megan and another volunteer who requested anonymity due to safety concerns. \nCOLLEGE PARK, Md.  Betty Phelps, an anti-abortion protester, stands outside the Metropolitan Family Planning Clinic in College Park on March 19. (Emily Hahn/Capital News Service)\nBetty Phelps, an anti-abortion protester and member of Grace Bible Church in Seabrook, Maryland, said she doesn’t really have any strong opinions about the clinic escorts but she prays “for their hearts to be changed and consider the life of the baby.” \n“I think part of doing the job is not really listening to the nonsense,” the other volunteer escort said. “Like it just…it all becomes the same kind of…cycles of rhetoric and you just kind of have to tune them out.”\nVolunteers said they generally see more protesters on the weekends than during the week. Many of them are “regulars,” according to Megan. \n“The protesters are there to upset and manipulate you. That is what they consider, like, the success of their…they call it a sidewalk ministry,” said Samatha Clark, a WACDTF volunteer and abortion dula. \nClark has been an abortion clinic escort for five years. She started volunteering because she believes abortions are “a valid, normal medical procedure.” Clark wants to protect all patients from what she called the “level of abuse” they receive from protesters outside of clinics. \nClinic escorts also said more protesters were in the Washington area during the March for Life on Jan. 21 during the anniversary of the 1973 Roe v. Wade Supreme Court ruling that effectively legalized abortion. \nNew abortion restrictions have been enacted across the country. \nLast September, Texas enacted a stricter abortion access law which bans most abortions after a heartbeat is detected. Oklahoma, Missouri, Kentucky and other states in the last two years have written similar bills banning abortion of fetuses once a heartbeat can be detected or other limitations prohibiting abortions. \nMaryland’s abortion law states that a woman may legally terminate her pregnancy if the procedure is conducted by the 26th week, before the fetus is viable; or the abortion is to protect the life of the mother, or a fetus has a genetic defect “or serious deformity or abnormality.”\nThe Supreme Court is expected to rule in June or July on the constitutionality of a Mississippi law that bans abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy. Anti-abortion advocates anticipate that the conservative majority on the high court either will uphold the Mississippi statute.\nDespite the charged surroundings at some abortion clinics, people still volunteer to be patient escorts.\nSome days ago at Washingtons NoMa Planned Parenthood, a woman walked through a phalanx of protesters and went straight to a WACDTF volunteer in a bright orange vest.\n The woman asked how she could become a volunteer herself. She was handed a pamphlet on how to join the escort group."

    "title": "Lawmakers and advocates see new tool against hate crimes as lynching becomes federal crime",
    "content": "WASHINGTON – Some lawmakers and civil rights advocates are calling for the Justice Department to be more aggressive in prosecuting hate crimes now that lynching is a federal hate crime. \nRep. Bobby Rush, D-Illinois, and one of the main champions of the new law, said he is looking for “expedited accountability” from the Justice Department. \n“Wherever there’s a hate crime that’s reported in the media or allegations of a hate crime anywhere in our nation and if it involves two or more people, then the federal government must aggressively pursue and investigate that crime or potential crime,” Rush, a senior member of the Congressional Black Caucus, told Capital News Service.   \nThe Chicago Democrat originally sponsored the Emmett Till Antilynching Act in 2019, the latest in a long line of similar legislation over the past 130 years. \nRep. Kweisi Mfume, who left his Baltimore seat to lead the NAACP for nearly a decade before returning to Congress in 2020, told CNS that he hopes the new law empowers law enforcement. \n“We believe now that this is the law, that theres got to be a willingness on the part of the Justice Department to enforce that law,” Mfume said. “Otherwise, there wont be any accountability and nobody can predict whether something as heinous is going to take place as this again.” \nArusha Gordon, the associate director of the James Byrd Jr. Center to Stop Hate at the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, said the determination to prosecute is based on an internal commitment by an agency. \n“There is this additional element in terms of showing bias motivation, and I think you really need to have people who are motivated to look for that evidence,” Gordon said.\nLegislation to make lynching a federal hate crime was introduced and failed over 200 times in Congress, the Howard Center for Investigative Journalism at the University of Marylands Philip Merrill College of Journalism reported in November.\nBut on March 29, President Joe Biden signed the Emmett Till Antilynching Act, making lynching a federal crime for the first time in the nation’s history. \nWhile some lawmakers are pushing for more aggressive prosecution from the Justice Department, lawyers, outside groups and even other lawmakers warn that the new law’s chief significance is symbolic rather than legal. \nDel. Eleanor Holmes Norton, D-District of Columbia, and another senior Congressional Black Caucus member, said that it would be difficult to get retribution for lynchings that have already happened, but it’s important for the federal government to make this historic declaration. \n“It would have been outrageous not to pass it,” Norton said in an interview. “I dont understand why it took more than 200 times.” \nIn hate crimes reports to Congress, the Justice Department repeatedly said it was prioritizing prosecution of hate crime cases. But the agency reported in July that it declined to prosecute 83% of hate crime suspects from 2005 to 2019. \nAttorney General Merrick Garland sent a memo to Justice Department employees in May of last year outlining a multi-step plan to boost federal hate crime prosecutions. \n“These actions will enhance our current efforts to combat unlawful acts of hate by improving incident reporting, increasing law enforcement training and coordination at all levels of government, prioritizing community outreach, and making better use of civil enforcement mechanisms,” Garland said. \n“All of these steps share common objectives: deterring hate crimes and bias-related incidents, addressing them when they occur, supporting those victimized by them, and reducing the pernicious effects these incidents have on our society,” the attorney general added.\nMfume says he’s waiting to see to what extent the new commitment comes to fruition. \n“You dont want to tell the chief law enforcement officer that he ought to be prosecuting one thing or another,” said Mfume, who sits on the House Oversight and Reform Committee and was chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus in the 1990s. “But you do want to imply that in order to be accountable, there has to be enforcement of existing law. Thats what we have been trying to drive home from the beginning.” \nSen. Cory Booker, D-New Jersey, who sponsored the anti-lynching legislation in the Senate along with Vice President Kamala Harris before she left the Senate, said the new law is another tool for the Justice Department to use in hate crime prosecution, but he also hopes the law serves as a deterrent. \n“For the federal government to be silent on this crime for all these years is reprehensible,” Booker told CNS. “So this is a very important statement to our country that this kind of terrorism, and murder will not be tolerated.” \nSen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Maryland, said “it is critical that we make clear that racially driven harassment and violence have no place in our society and will be met with serious legal consequences.”\n“And with hate crimes reaching their highest level in years, having this additional federal charge in their arsenal gives federal prosecutors another tool in the fight for justice,” the senator said in a statement to CNS.\nBiden and Harris emphasized the need for accountability at the March bill signing in the White House’s Rose Garden. \n“Lynching is not a relic of the past,” Harris said at the signing ceremony. “Racial acts of terror still occur in our nation. And when they do, we must all have the courage to name them and hold the perpetrators accountable.” \nThe new law doesn’t limit the definition of lynching to the hanging of a victim from a tree. In fact, even in cases where a victim survives a lynching, federal prosecutors can still argue the violent act was a hate crime. The law also expands the type of behavior that is typically associated with hate crimes. \n“Really what it does is it allows prosecutors to address a wider swath of…activity and it recognizes the conspiratorial nature that is often part of hateful activity and hate crimes,” Gordon said. \nThe conspiracy section the new law adds is very narrow, according to Michael Lieberman, senior policy counsel at the Southern Poverty Law Center. Even so, he said he regards the law as one of the most important hate crime laws passed in the last four decades. \n“The bottom line is, this legislation is really important to be able to finally close the loop on 120 years of trying to get this to be a federal crime for those rare instances where state and locals are either unable or unwilling to investigate and prosecute,” Lieberman said. \nHe cited as an example the 2020 murder of Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia, where local prosecutors initially resisted investigating Arbery’s death. \nLieberman and Mfume believe the anti-lynching law can be used to teach Americans about the civil rights movement and the history of lynching. \n“This is really an important opportunity for us to be able to talk about this horrific era in our history, that horrific aspect of targeted racial violence and the intimidation and terror that sprung from lynching,” Lieberman said. “It was intentional extrajudicial killings, in an effort to make sure that there was terror.” \nCongress is considering additional bills that would address racial disparities and racism in the federal criminal justice system. \nFor example, the Congressional Black Caucus is urging Senate Democrats to get rid of the country’s sentencing disparities for crack and powder cocaine that disproportionately give Black Americans longer and tougher prison sentences. \n“Making our justice system more just is the really critical thing,” Booker said. \nThere were more than 4,400 lynchings in the United States between the end of the Civil and War and World War II, according to the Equal Justice Initiative. These lynchings and other modes of racial terror were often perpetuated by community newspapers in the 1800s and 1900s, according to an extensive analysis of news clippings by the Howard Center."

    "title": "In Ukraine conflict, Syrians and Syrian-Americans witness familiar Russian brutality",
    "content": "As Ukraine defends itself against Russian forces, it is getting unexpected help from Syrian and Syrian-American doctors, lawyers and activists who have seen first-hand the brutality inflicted by Russian ground and air forces supporting Bashar al Assad’s regime for the last 11 years.\n“We are seeing the same tactics in Ukraine now as we saw in Syria,” said Amjad Rass, a former Aleppo physician who heads the Syrian American Medical Society, which is placing doctors in Ukrainian facilities. “We can help our colleagues in Ukraine with war-related injuries, we can help them with how to deal with besiegement, massive displacement, attacks on healthcare and how to document that.”\nThe Syrian Ukrainian Network was formed recently to match Syrians and Syrian-Americans with relevant skills to the humanitarian effort on the ground. Coordinator Olga Lautman, a senior fellow at the Center for European Policy Analysis in Washington, is using her Ukrainian connections to arrange volunteer placements and to help obtain visas as well as translators, transportation and housing inside the country.\nThe network has connected Syrian lawyers experienced in investigating and documenting war crimes to lawyers in Ukraine, she said. They are also linking outside advocacy groups fighting pervasive Russian disinformation inside Ukraine and elsewhere.\n“There are things that Syrians can pick up easily, especially if it involves cluster bombs or mass graves,” Lautman said, “things that Syrians have already experienced – and that Ukrainians have not yet.”\nUKRAINE  A bloody stretcher used to transport a victim of a mine-blast injury in the Brovary region. Chicago physician Samer Attar says injuries doctors are seeing in Ukraine are strikingly similar to those seen in Syria. (Photo courtesy of Samer Attar)\nAnother of those is the use of chemical weapons on the battlefield.\nDr. Mohamed Tennari, a Syrian doctor who previously treated chemical-attack-related injuries, used Lautman’s network to go to Ukraine recently to help prepare physicians for the worst. When asked if he thought Russia would use chemical weapons, Tennari’s response was grim.\n“If the Russians feel themselves in a bad situation, they can do anything. There is a big chance they can use it,” Tennari said.\nLautman closely followed Russian media during the height of the Syrian conflict and saw clear indicators of the coming chemical attacks. We are now seeing those indicators in Ukraine, she said.\n“They’ve been laying the groundwork,” she said, by equipping Russian troops with chemical agent antidotes and by spreading false claims that Ukraine has biological weapons.\nThe most obvious similarity between the two wars is the bombardment of civilian infrastructure, including schools, apartment buildings and hospitals, say humanitarian and military experts steeped in the Syrian war. Purposefully targeting civilians is considered a war crime under international law.\nSamer Attar, a Chicago orthopedic surgeon who volunteered in Syria after learning hospitals there were being bombed during the war, entered Ukraine last week on a similar mission.\nSpeaking over an encrypted app from Ukraine, he described a man with a mine-blast injury. The injury reminded him of a child he treated in Syria where such high-velocity injuries were common. The child had someone else’s bone fragments lodged in his skin from an airstrike on his school.\nThe injury “looks exactly like the ones that you would find anywhere in Syria,” he said from a hospital in the Brovary region outside of Kiev.\nUkraine says 158 children have been killed in the war, while the United Nations says 59 have died. The World Health Organization has reported 105 Russian attacks impacting healthcare facilities in Ukraine.\n“On a humanitarian level, because of what we’ve seen in Syria, we know what the Russians will do and how brutal they’re going to be,” said Shadi Martini, executive director of Multifaith Alliance for Syrian Refugees and formerly a hospital manager in Aleppo who escaped in 2012. “Mariupol was expected for us. We know what the Russians are capable of.”\nAs a tactic, the bombardment is meant to bring about starvation, he said.\nBased on Russian actions in Syria, Russian troops are then likely to show up with food to save the population it just bombed, said U.S. Army Col. Myles B. Caggins III, the former spokesman for the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS in Iraq and Syria and a fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations.\n“In a few weeks, we’re likely to see Russian infantrymen carrying bags of grain and baby formula and handing it to the civilians in these eastern cities as a way to show that they are the good guys,” he said. “They want to paint the picture that the Ukrainian government has abandoned its citizens.”\nAs in Syria, even the agreed-to ceasefires and humanitarian corridors are part of Russia’s propaganda campaign to portray themselves as saviors, said Carsten Wieland, a German diplomat and senior United Nations consultant.\n“This whole process of corridors and so on, is part of that, because suddenly the core of the war is 100,000 civilians being trapped in Mariupol,” he said. “And Russia is trying to use it for their own propaganda.”\nWieland said this could include Russians “distributing their Russian-marked packages of humanitarian aid in Mariupol to starving civilians who have no other choice but to accept it or opening corridors towards the east  towards Russia  where Russian cameras are standing saying ‘look, the Ukrainians are fleeing from their own Ukrainian government.”\nPortraying Russians as humanitarian liberators is a disinformation tactic the Kremlin also used in Syria, where Russian officials justified bombing cities like Homs and Aleppo by claiming to fight Islamic extremism.\n“Russia would claim that there were terrorist groups throughout those urban areas,” said Caggins. “While there was a presence of some terrorists, that in no way can explain the tens of thousands of civilians killed and maimed by Russians.”\nIn Ukraine, Russian authorities claim to be fighting Nazis, a label that is likely to appeal to the Russian population, said Caggins.\n“Now, they’ve employed social media trolls, paid agitators, fake media personalities, fake experts and fake anti-imperialist influencers … It’s basically rinse and repeat,’ said Caggins. “They did it in Syria. They got away with it. They’re doing it in Ukraine.”\nStill, there are differences.\nRetired Army Brig. Gen. Peter Zwack, the senior defense attaché at the U.S. Russian Embassy from 2012–2014, says the Russians have mistakenly convinced themselves their success in Syria will translate to Ukraine.\nIn Syria, the Russian-backed Assad regime and the Russian military maintained nearly uncontested control of the skies. Ukrainian forces, however, have had considerable success downing Russian war planes at low and medium altitudes, Zwack said.\nAt the root of Russia’s overconfidence, said Zwack, are incorrect, deeply-held biases.\n“Russian authorities hold these core beliefs: Ukraine isn’t a real nation and they aren’t real people  they are part of us,” Zwack said. “That dismissive aspect has manifested in military planning. They thought winning a war in Ukraine would be a cakewalk.”\nFor recent volunteers with time in war-torn Syria, revisiting a war zone has not been easy. For Attar, who is consulting with Ukrainian physicians on the best ways to manage war casualties, the trip to Ukraine also meant revisiting the personal stress of war-torn Syria.\n“I had to revisit that fear: of airstrikes, of another siege. But…there’s a strength and power of community that helped me overcome that fear. Especially when you’re in a hospital where everyone  no matter what their role  had one job: helping and saving others.”\nEditor’s note: Eve Sampson is a former U.S. Army captain who was deployed to Syria in 2018."

Riho Ühtegi, commander of the Estonian Defense League, and their staffs were briefed on the capabilities of the Maryland National Guard, talked with Pentagon officials, and sat down with representatives of the Maryland Department of Emergency Management.\n“We are not partners,” Mašović told Capital News Service. “We are brothers.”\n“Nowadays, its actually important to increase capacity of the partners abroad to prevent any negative influence of our opponents,” Mašović added. “I’m talking about negative influence of Russia and China, in Bosnia-Herzegovina, in our region, in Europe, and against democracy.”\nAfter the fall of the Soviet Union, the United States developed the State Partnership Program as a way to show former Warsaw Pact nations and newly independent states the benefits of partnering with Western countries.\n“The National Guard was a natural partner because we had the benefit of staying in a state and therefore being able to maintain that relationship for a lifetime,” Army Maj. Harrison Bittenbender, the director of the program, explained.\nEstonia gained independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. Two years later, the country was paired with the Maryland National Guard.\n“In the beginning, of course, we needed a lot of help. Estonia was a new state,” Ühtegi said. “We wanted to build up a Western-type military.”\nEstonia joined NATO in 2004. In order to become a NATO member state, a country must be working toward military compatibility  meaning that the country uses equipment and doctrine that is interoperable with other NATO members  a task that the Maryland guard assisted in.\nÜhtegi, a former Estonian special forces commander who talked with U.S. Army Special Forces personnel at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, earlier in his visit, said that his first trip abroad as an officer was a state partnership program event 28 years ago.\n“So in this time, (the program) was just kind of help,” he said. “But in time, it became more and more like cooperation.”\nThe Maryland-Estonian partnership turns 30 next year. Estonia shares a 183-mile long border with Russia, which after invading Ukraine made threats against Baltic and Nordic states.\n“We are next to Russia,” Ühtegi said. “It makes us even more focused to resist a threat on our borders.”\nIn a typical year, the Maryland guard’s partnership program conducts 30 to 40 exercises during which a handful of personnel are sent between countries for training. But the COVID pandemic forced a pause to those activities for over a year.\nThe program resumed in June of last year, several months after Bittenbender assumed the role of program director.\n“I was the bilateral affairs officer from 2016 to 2019 in Bosnia-Herzegovina. It was an amazing job,” he said. “When the job to be the director…became available, it was the one job in the state that I was like ‘yes, I am willing to drive from Virginia to come do this job.’”\nIn May, the Maryland National Guard is deploying a large contingent of personnel to the annual Defender Europe military exercise, where they will be training with their partner countries’ forces.\nThe exercise, scheduled from May 16 to 27, will include the movement of U.S. division-size force (usually between 10,000 and 15,000 soldiers) with equipment to demonstrate the rapid deployment of combat-ready troops, according to NATO. Locations for the exercises will be Albania, Estonia, Germany, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia. \n“It’s significant to SPP, because we’re exercising with our partner,” Bittenbender said. “Anytime we can work with the Estonians or the Bosnians is a plus.”\nThe Maryland-Bosnian partnership was established in 2003.\nMašović said that his visit with the national guard and Pentagon officials was fruitful. He said he views the Maryland guard as a credible partner that, through continued cooperation, has created a strong level of trust.\nA reception ceremony was held at Camp Fretterd Thursday evening and Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan was in attendance. \n“In recent weeks, we have again been reminded of exactly why strong ties and alliances like this are so critical,” Hogan said. “We have worked together closely all these years  conducting training exercises and building an enduring partnership  to be prepared to help ensure stability and democracy through uncertain and dangerous times.”"

    "title": "In historic vote, Senate confirms Jackson as first Black woman justice on Supreme Court",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  The Senate on Thursday confirmed Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson as the next associate justice on the Supreme Court and the first Black woman to sit on the nation’s highest court.\nThe historic 53-47 vote was bipartisan, with a trio of Republicans — Sens. Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Mitt Romney of Utah  joining all the Senate Democrats in supporting Jackson.\nWhile President Joe Biden and Jackson watched the proceedings from the White House’s Roosevelt Room, Vice President Kamala Harris presided over the confirmation vote. \nWASHINGTON  As the Senate voted to confirm her to the Supreme Court, Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson poses for a selfie with President Joe Biden in the White Houses Roosevelt Room. (The White House)\n“We’ve taken another step toward making our highest court reflect the diversity of America,” Biden tweeted after the vote. “She will be an incredible Justice, and I was honored to share this moment with her.”\nAn ebullient Harris told reporters as she left the United States Capitol Building: “It’s a statement that on our highest court in the land, we want to make sure that there is going to be full representation and the finest and brightest and the best. That’s what happened today. I’m very proud.”\nBiden nominated Jackson on Feb. 25 after Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer announced his plans to retire at the end of the current session, which is expected to be in June or early July. Jackson’s confirmation fulfilled a Biden campaign promise that he would appoint the first Black woman to the Supreme Court. \nJackson currently serves as a federal judge on the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. She previously served as a district judge for the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, the vice-chair of the United States Sentencing Commission, and was a clerk for Breyer. She will also be the first public defender to be appointed to the Supreme Court.\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-New York, said in a press conference after the vote that Jackson’s confirmation was “a long, hard road as we tried to get to greater equality, less bigotry in America.” \nHe added: “It was often steps backward. But when you have a day like this, it inspires you to keep moving forward. Theres no better group to have us move forward than this group.”\n\nSen. Dick Durbin, D-Illinois, who chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee, acknowledged the Republican senators that voted along with the Democrats. \n“I can’t say enough for my three colleagues,” he said. “I held out the hope that at the last minute, several others would join them (and) realize they won’t be on the right side of history this morning. We’ve got to continue to work to build bipartisanship.”\nAn emotional Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont, told reporters that in Jackson, “I see somebody extraordinarily well-qualified, somebody who makes the court look more like America. Frankly, I could say to my children and my grandchildren, ‘Be proud. Be proud of what you see.’\nBoth of Maryland’s senators, Democrats Ben Cardin and Chris Van Hollen, voted for Jackson. After the vote, Van Hollen tweeted: “With today’s vote, both Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson and the Senate made history…Like Marylander Thurgood Marshall before her, Judge Jackson is a trailblazer,  I know she will uphold equal justice under the law.”\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, has repeatedly attacked Jackson and those who supported her. In Thursday floor remarks, McConnell said the soon-to-be-justice had two choices: “Either satisfy her radical fan club or help preserve the judiciary that Americans need.” \nMcConnell added, “I’m afraid the nominee’s record tells us which is likely. But I hope Judge Jackson proves me wrong.”\nWASHINGTON  Members of the Congressional Black Caucus hail the confirmation of Ketanji Brown Jackson to the Supreme Court during a press conference in the United States Capitol. (Tatyana Monnay/Capital News Service)\nBefore the final vote itself, the Senate public galleries overlooking the floor filled with members of the Congressional Black Caucus. In an earlier Twitter post, some caucus members in black t-shirts reading “Black Women are Supreme.”\nThe final tally was delayed nearly 25 minutes by Sen. Rand Paul, R-Kentucky, who did not join the full Senate chamber for the vote. Finally, the casually-dressed Paul (whose attire violated Senate floor rules) peeked out from a door to give his thumbs-down “no” vote.\nAfter Harris announced the vote, the senators supporting Jackson and people in the gallery stood and flooded the chamber with approximately 30 seconds of thunderous applause.\nMost Republicans walked out during the applause, solemn-faced.  \nOn Friday, Biden and Harris are scheduled to host a celebratory event with Jackson at the White House.\nCapital News Service reporter Tatyana Monnay contributed to this story."

    "title": "DC’s iconic Uptown Theater may be readying reboot, documents show",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  On March 13, 2020  at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic  the nation’s capital was surprised by the sudden closure of the Uptown Theater, an iconic single-screen movie house that for decades hosted premieres and was beloved by film buffs throughout the metropolitan region.\nNow the theater appears on the verge of a comeback, according to documents filed with the city, although both the owner and the architect so far are tight-lipped about their plans. \nThe Uptown Theater, on Connecticut Avenue in the heart of Washington’s Cleveland Park neighborhood, was completed in 1936. The building was built around an art-deco style and designed by John Jacob Zink. \nThe theater had an 1,300-person seating capacity, including a balcony, and a giant curved screen measuring 70 feet wide by 40 feet tall that made it THE place for customers to see a movie. \nOver the years, the Uptown hosted premieres such as “2001: A Space Odyssey” in 1968, “Dances with Wolves” in 1990, and “Jurassic Park” in 1993.\nWASHINGTON  The idle box office of the Uptown Theater at 3426 Connecticut Avenue, NW in Washington, D.C. The theater has been closed since March 2020, the point-of-sale equipment has been removed from the box office, and white paper has been installed over the windows to block outside views of restoration work being done inside the building to reopen it as a movie theater. (Chris Barylick/Capital News Service)\n \n“When the first ‘Star Wars’ movie came out in May 1977, the theater showed the movie throughout the night for weeks, and hundreds of moviegoers would line up in front of our house with the line stretching for blocks up Newark Street,” Judy Kopff, a Cleveland Park neighborhood resident since 1974, told Capital News Service. \nKopff also recalled inviting 50 friends to join her and her husband, Gary, at the Uptown to watch “The Right Stuff” for her 37th birthday. The theater’s ushers chastised the group for serving champagne along with birthday cake. \nThe Uptown’s closure, which came without warning, coincided with COVID-19 business closures that were rampant in 2020. \nThe movie titles and showtimes were pulled off its marquee signage; upcoming movie posters were removed; the ticket booth was emptied of its point-of-sale equipment. The doors were covered with white paper that now obstructs outsiders’ views of what might be going on inside the theater. \nBeyond the initial outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Uptown, like the rest of the movie theater industry, began to see increased competition from streaming services. \n“Its tough times for movie theaters…you can watch so many movies on your computer or on your television,” said Bonnie LePard, president of the board of directors of the Cleveland Park Historical Society. \nFor more than a year, the Uptown sat closed with residents and passersby walking down Connecticut Avenue and wondering about the fate of the centerpiece of the neighborhood. \nBut clues began to emerge. Last October, the Uptown’s address was found on a new liquor license application, according to Commissioner Sauleh Siddiqui, a Cleveland Park resident and a member of the Advisory Neighborhood Council 3C05. \n“Our ANC passed a resolution supporting their ABRA (Alcoholic Beverage Regulation Administration) license last year. I know there are improvements going on inside the theater,” Siddiqui said in an email. \nA separate permit for electrical work inside the Uptown Theater states that both the existing and proposed use for the site is as a motion picture facility.\nKaleb Electric, LLC of Burke, Virginia, is assigned to do the electrical work and Mitiku G. Bela is listed as the master electrician for the project. \nCNS found that a permit application for construction within the theater has been received by the District of Columbia’s Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs. \n“It’s a great project,” said Thomas Rael, whose firm, RaelArchitecture(s) of New York, also appears on the approved permit for electrical work at the Uptown Theater site. Rael declined to go into further detail about the work being done inside the historic building. \nFor both residents of the neighborhood and fans of the Uptown Theater’s beloved art deco architecture, historical preservation-related protections have been put into place  and additional ones applied for  in order to keep the building’s famous facade intact. \n“The building has its first layer of protection thats fully in place is that its listed as a contributing resource to the Cleveland Park Historic District,” said Steve Knight, president of the Art Deco Society of Washington. \nKnight also pointed out the Cleveland Park Historical Society and the D.C. Preservation League jointly filed for a landmark designation of the Uptown Theater building in 2021. \nThe designation would provide an additional layer of protection for the building and prevent changes to its exterior. The landmark nomination for the Uptown Theater will be going before the DC Historic Preservation Review Board in late May. \n“We hope it will be approved,” said LePard. \nOne of the most pressing questions is who will operate the Uptown should it reopen. \nBefore the closing in March 2020, movie theater chain AMC Theatres functioned as the operator. The Pedas family, which owns the Circle Management Company, owns the Uptown Theater itself. \nMedia reports from October 2021 stated that movie theater chain Landmark Theatres might be next to operate the Uptown, as AMC’s lease ended in 2020 and AMC removed the movie projector from the theater once its lease expired. \nSince then, nothing concrete has been announced as to who the next operator will be. \nThere have been friendly email exchanges between the Cleveland Park Historical Society’s “Save the Uptown” committee and George Pedas, of the Circle Management Company, according to LePard. \n“When I asked him first about the Landmark (chain)…he just said that they were in conversations with Landmark and it was just too early,” LePard said, explaining her email exchanges with Pedas. \nRepresentatives of Circle Management declined requests to comment for this story.\nLePard said Pedas had indicated to her in emails that major electrical work in the theater would take considerable time. The owner also let LePard know that he was trying to be patient as work continued to reopen the old building as a movie theater.\n“I just think its iconic and of special value to the city of Washington, D.C.,” Bonnie LePard concluded, a sentiment many people in the city share with her."

    "title": "Hours after Zelenskyy asks Congress for more help, Biden sends additional weapons",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Wednesday sternly addressed a joint session of Congress, asking for additional military help.\nHours after the historic remarks, President Joe Biden announced a new $800 million military aid package that will supply the Ukrainian armed forces with hundreds of anti-aircraft systems, and thousands of anti-armor weapons, as well as small arms, ammunition, body armor and helmets. The package brings total U.S. aid to Ukraine since January to $2 billion.\nLater in the day, Biden told reporters in unscripted comments that Russian leader Vladimir Putin “is a war criminal.”\nIn his formal remarks, Biden said “The world is united in our support for Ukraine and our determination to make (Russian President Vladimir) Putin pay a very heavy price.” \n“We are going to continue to have (Ukraine’s) backs as they fight for their freedom, their democracy, their very survival,” the president said. “Together, with our allies and partners, we will keep up the pressure on Putin’s crumbling economy  isolating him on the global stage. That’s our goal.” \nIn a virtual 18-minute speech from the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv, Zelenskyy appealed to the American memory of the Pearl Harbor and Sept. 11 attacks and expressed his gratitude for the United State’s support thus far.\n“Today, the Ukrainian people are not only defending Ukraine,” Zelenskyy said. “We are fighting for the values of Europe and the world, sacrificing our lives in the name of the future.”\nAt the beginning and conclusion of the Ukrainian leader’s speech, he was greeted by bipartisan standing ovations and cheers from lawmakers.\nWhile the additional aid will assist Ukraine in its fight, Biden has maintained that the implementation of a NATO no-fly zone  a concession Zelenskyy asked Congress for in his speech  is out of the question. \n“Russia has turned the Ukrainian sky into a source of death for thousands of people,” Zelenskyy said. “Is this a lot to ask for to create a no-fly zone over Ukraine to save people?”\nZelenskyy challenged the members of Congress to take additional actions until Russian aggression ceases. \nHe proposed sanctions on all Russian politicians still in office and the closure of all American ports to Russian goods. He called on every American company to leave the Russian market, saying that it is “flooded with our blood.”\nWithout naming the organizations, Zelenskyy said the world institutions charged with preventing war do not work and have failed in their missions. \nHe proposed a new organization, called “U24,” with the goal of stopping all conflicts immediately and providing all the necessary assistance  including weapons and humanitarian aid   within 24 hours.\nHalfway through the address, Zelenskyy played a video for Congress. The interlude depicted graphic images of air strikes and wounded Ukrainian civilivians, including an infant child. Accompanied by classical violin music, the video also showed a mass grave being filled with the corpses of civilians in body bags.\nAfter the video, Zelenskyy addressed Congress in English. “I am almost 45-years-old,” he said. Today, my age stopped when the hearts of more than 100 children stopped beating.”\nLawmakers were moved by the address and said they were determined to do all the United States could do.\n“(Zelenskyy’s) message was clear, we need staying power to isolate Russia and Mr. Putin,” Sen. Ben Cardin, D-Maryland, said during an interview on MSNBC. “What we need to do is make sure that Ukraine has the equipment it needs in order to defend itself, particularly the skys.”\nHouse Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Mechanicsville, thanked Zelenskyy for his vision of security and peace. \nHoyer said in a statement that he looks forward to the day that the Ukrainian president may stand in the Capitol in person and “receive the gratitude of the American people for defending global democracy on its front lines in its hour of peril.”\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, called his speech “powerful and heart-wrenching” in a statement. \n“It reinforced our sympathy, our outrage, and our resolve,” McConnell said.\nBut the GOP leader went on to criticize the Biden administration for what he said was a slow response to Russian escalation.\nIn his final sentences, Zelenskyy applauded Biden for his leadership, adding: “Being the leader of the world means to be the leader of peace.”"

    "title": "The war in Ukraine: Questions and answers",
    "content": "WASHINGTON — It’s been three weeks since Russia invaded Ukraine, causing countless deaths and widespread destruction and generating the greatest refugee flow in Europe since World War II. \nRussia’s unprovoked attack unified Europe and NATO and prompted unprecedented sanctions aimed at crippling the Russian economy and forcing Vladimir Putin to the negotiating table. \nHere are some questions and answers about the conflict.\nWhen did the war start?\nOn the morning of Feb. 24, while the United Nations Security Council was holding an emergency session, Russian President Vladimir Putin released a pre-recorded video announcing a “special military operation” in Ukraine. \nHe had declared war without saying the words. Artillery barrages and airstrikes rained on Ukraine as Russian soldiers and equipment began to move across the border from the north, east and south. \nRussia had been assembling forces on the Ukrainian border since early December 2021. \nBut this is only the latest and most drastic escalation in a conflict, overlooked by most of the world, that has been ongoing since 2014. \nIn the early months of that year, the Ukrainian people ousted then-President Victor Yanukovych after he unilaterally decided to create closer ties with Russia instead of signing a treaty with the European Union that the parliament had overwhelmingly supported.\nYanukovych fled Ukraine during what is called the Maidan Revolution. Russia viewed the revolution as an illegal coup and took the opportunity to annex the Crimean Peninsula and start a proxy war in the Donetsk and Luhansk provinces of Ukraine. \nThe fighting in the two provinces between the Ukrainian Army and Russian-backed separatists came to be known as the Donbas War, a relatively low-level conflict that nevertheless has resulted in the deaths of an estimated 14,000 people.\nWhat is Russia and Ukraine’s history?\nUkraine and Russia have a long, intertwined history. Many Ukrainian families have blood relatives in Russia and vice versa. The two peoples share religious beliefs and cultural traditions. \nKyiv, Ukraine’s capital city, was the founding seat of Kievan Rus’ from the 9th to the 13th century  the predecessor of the Russian tsarist empire. \nIn its later history, Ukraine was alternately part of the Russian Empire, an independent country and then part of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. \nUkraine declared itself an independent country in August of 1991. The Soviet Union collapsed in December of that same year. The Russian Federation, the successor to the Soviet Union, has viewed Ukraine as within its sphere of influence ever since.\nWhat is NATO?\nThe North Atlantic Treaty Organization is a political and military alliance among 30 European and North American countries. \nIt was founded in 1949 to counter the expanding influence of the Soviet Union after the end of World War II. After the fall of the USSR, former Warsaw Pact states such as Poland and Hungary joined NATO, thus shrinking the Russian sphere of influence. \nArticle 5 of the NATO treaty states that an attack on one member country is to be treated as an attack on every member country, binding every signatory to come to the defense of the attacked. This includes responses ranging from conventional military forces up to the use of nuclear weapons.\nPresident Joe Biden has promised to “defend every inch” of NATO territory should Russia expand the scope of the conflict. He has also repeatedly stated that neither the United States nor NATO will send soldiers to fight on Ukraine’s behalf. \nThree NATO members  the United States, the United Kingdom and France  are recognized nuclear weapon states.\nIs Ukraine a NATO member state?\nUkraine is not a NATO member state but has been forging stronger ties with the organization since the 2014 Russian annexation of Crimea and the beginning of the Donbas War. \nUnited States special forces and military units of other NATO members have trained the Ukrainian Army. \nA 2014 poll showed that nearly 50% of the Ukrainian public supported joining NATO. That percentage jumped up to about 69% in a 2020 poll. At the same time, Ukraines president began talks with NATO to join the alliance.\nThe expansion of NATO influence is one of the reasons Putin cited as justification for the invasion of Ukraine. \nIn the early days of the invasion, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy asked NATO to grant emergency membership to his country. On March 15, he announced Ukraine will no longer seek NATO membership.\nHowever, Zelenskyy on Feb. 28 signed the application for Ukraine to become an European Union member state. An overwhelming majority of EU members voted to advance Ukraine’s application, but full integration into the EU will take some time.\nWhat has been the international response to the invasion?\nThe international response has largely followed the United States’ lead. According to a March 11 White House statement, over 30 countries have levied sanctions against Russia,  including Switzerland, which traditionally maintained neutrality in international conflicts. \nGermany halted the Nord Stream 2 Baltic Sea gas pipeline, which would have doubled the inflow of Russian gas into the country. \nCollectively, the international community cut key Russian banks off from the SWIFT system, preventing those entities from making or receiving international payments. \nThe United States and other NATO countries have also been providing arms to Ukraine in the form of anti-tank and anti-aircraft weapons.\nSeveral NATO countries have shown interest in expanding their own military capabilities as they aid Ukraine. Both Germany and Poland have signed deals to buy American F-35 fighter jets and in mid-February the State Department approved a contract for Poland to buy 250 Abrams tanks.  \nThe United Nations General Assembly overwhelmingly voted to pass a non-binding resolution to condemn Russia’s invasion. \nWhat effects are the sanctions having?\nSince the first round of sanctions was imposed, the Russian ruble has severely depreciated in value. One U.S. dollar was worth the equivalent of about 120 rubles as of March 15. \nRussia’s stock exchange has remained closed since the start of the invasion.\nAn International Monetary Fund official said that Russia defaulting on its sovereign debt is no longer “improbable.”  \nThe sanctions target Putin and the oligarchs closest to him. Their assets, like private yacht and condo penthouses, are being seized and they are unable to leave Russia as all Russian planes have been banned from U.S. and EU airspace.  \nPrivate companies and athletic organizations have been moving their businesses out of Russia. \nThe Formula 1 racing championship canceled its Sochi Grand Prix. Numerous global firms, including McDonalds, Exxon, Ford Motor Co., Airbnb, Disney and Ikea, have suspended business in Russia. \nWhat countries support Russia?\nDespite the near-universal international condemnation of Russia, a handful of countries have stood behind Russia. Belarus, North Korea, Eritrea and Syria all voted against the UN resolution. Belarus allowed Russian forces to attack Ukraine from its territory.\nChina has remained on the sidelines of this conflict, walking a tightrope between the United States and Russia. While China has yet to publicly criticize Russia, it has called for hostilities to cease and peace talks to begin.\nWhat is the status of the war?\nIt has been 20 days since the beginning of the Russian invasion and Ukraine has been holding its own. The Russian advance has stalled in many places, according to U.S. and international military and intelligence officials. \nThe quick lightning strikes Russian forces attempted in the early days of the war to either seize or destroy key objectives largely failed. The Russians still have not gained air superiority. \nThe anti-armor and anti-air missiles supplied to Ukraine by NATO countries have been extremely effective.\nThe exact number of Russian losses is hard to say with any accuracy, as reports vary wildly. The latest estimates from U.S. officials report Russia has lost up to 6,000 soldiers. As of March 16, Kyiv estimates over 13,800 Russian soldiers have been killed. And 430 tanks and 84 planes have been disabled. Little information has been published about Ukrainian losses.\nThe Russian military has been plagued by logistical, supply and strategic issues, according to western military analysts. \nUndamaged Russian tanks have been found abandoned in fields because they ran out of fuel. Russian soldiers have reportedly been begging for food from Ukrainians. A picture of a Russian ration pack showed it had expired in 2015. \nThe Russians have seemingly changed their strategy from achieving military objectives to attempting to force submission through the general destruction of civilian infrastructure. \nResidential neighborhoods, hospitals and utility providers have been targeted with weapons like cluster bombs  a type of munition whose use has been deemed a war crime because of their potential to cause widespread and indiscriminate casualties. \nWho is Russia sending to fight?\nBefore the invasion began, the United States estimated Russia had amassed up to 190,000 soldiers on the Ukrainian border, along with tanks, infantry fighting vehicles, anti-aircraft defenses and all the necessary logistical support, including fuel and blood for field hospitals. \nSince the invasion began, videos of captured Russian soldiers have been surfacing on social media. While unverified, the individual videos do share similar narratives. \nThe soldiers are often young men who claim to be conscripts. Many say they were told they were on training missions and weren’t told they were being sent to fight in Ukraine. Others say they were told the Ukrainians wanted the Russians to “liberate” them and expected to be welcomed with open arms. \nThe Russian government previously said there were no conscripts fighting in Ukraine. On March 9, the Kremlin acknowledged there were conscripts in Ukraine. \nU.S. officials have recently said that Russia is recruiting mercenaries from countries like Syria and Libya. Estimates range up to 40,000 fighters.\nWhat do Russian citizens think about the war?\nTens of thousands of Russian citizens have been protesting the war since its beginning in every major Russian city and around the world. Citizens, athletes and even a Russian oligarch with close ties to Putin have called for an end to the war.\nThe protests have been so widespread that Putin felt the need to criminalize repeated protesting and police have been diligently enforcing the law. \nVideos of police in full riot gear dragging away protesters have plastered social media feeds. A 77-year-old woman who lived through the siege of Leningrad during the second world war was arrested for protesting the war.\nNearly all independent media in Russia has been shut down and social media such as Facebook and Twitter have been blocked by Russian authorities.  \nWho is fighting for Ukraine?\nThe Ukrainian regular Army numbered around 200,000 active personnel in 2016, according to the International Institute for Strategic Studies. That made it the second largest army in Europe at the time, with Russia wielding the largest number of conventional forces.  \nAt the time, the Ukrainian Army had been fighting Russian-backed separatists for two years and had undertaken a modernization program to bring its equipment in line with NATO standards by 2020. \nAn accurate count of the current number of personnel in the Ukrainian armed forces is hard to come by.\nIn the months leading up to the invasion, thousands of civilians enlisted in the army and even more received training in basic weapons handling. Videos of civilians making Molotov cocktails and home-brewed napalm have surfaced on social media.\nIn late February, Ukraine announced that males aged 18 to 60 would not be permitted to leave the country as long as martial law remained in effect.\nZelenskyy welcomed foreign nationals to fight for his country. According to Kyiv, over 20,000 personnel have enlisted in the Ukrainian Foreign Legion. These numbers have yet to be independently verified.\nWhat are Ukrainian civilians doing?\nApart from those who have taken up arms, many Ukrainian civilians have sought shelter in their home cities. \nIn 2020, Ukraine had an estimated population of 44 million. On March 15, the International Organization for Migration  a UN agency  said more than 3 million people had fled the conflict to neighboring countries. This number includes foreign nationals living in Ukraine.\nThe UN Human Rights Office said on March 15 that at least 726 Ukrainian civilians have been confirmed dead and 1,174 have been injured. Other estimates are higher.\nWhat is a NATO no-fly zone?\nZelenskyy asked NATO in early March to impose a no-fly zone over Ukrainian airspace. Since then it has become a popular talking point for media outlets and politicians.\nBiden and other NATO leaders have repeatedly stated that NATO will not implement a no-fly zone, stating that it would cause an escalation in tensions between Russia and the alliance and a direct military confrontation could lead to World War III.\nA no-fly zone means the military effectively closes an airspace with the threat of or use of force.\n A NATO no-fly zone over Ukraine would mean Russian war planes would not be allowed to fly over Ukraine and thus prevented from conducting air strikes on military and civilian targets. \nNote: Research for this story is based on readily available public information from government and non-government, non-partisan organizations, as well as international sources and media reporting."

    "title": "With Wentz in the wings, Commanders hope for turnaround. Again.",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  Coming off a mediocre 7-10 season, a tumultuous name change, and controversial allegations against their owner, the Washington Commanders needed to make a splash in the 2022 NFL offseason.\nAnd before the new league year has even begun, they’ve landed a major piece to the puzzle.\nDealing three high-round draft choices, the Commanders traded last week for Indianapolis Colts quarterback Carson Wentz in a reported early blockbuster deal.\nHe’s the newest hope for a team that has run through a long string of quarterbacks. Washington’s football team hasn’t won a Super Bowl since 1992.\nWentz, who spent five years previously with the Philadelphia Eagles, makes a return to the NFC East looking to bring stability to the position and lead Washington back to the playoffs. \n!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var a in e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r=0;r\n“I’m looking forward to getting to Washington,” Wentz said in a tweet. “This organization has a rich history and a roster full of talent. I’m going to do everything I can this offseason to prepare for a special season, and I can’t wait to see you at FedEx Field this fall!” \nIn addition to getting Wentz, the Commanders received a second-round draft choice and a seventh-round draft choice, both this year.\nThe Colts got second- and third-round draft choices this year and a conditional second-round draft choice next year. \nThe trade comes after Washington reportedly inquired about a potential trade involving then-Seattle Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson.\nBut the Seahawks ended up sending Wilson to the Denver Broncos in a blockbuster trade.  \n“It’s clear to me that Washington is trying to make the best out of this situation,” former NFL general manager Mike Tannenbaum said to The Spun. “They gave up a lot for a guy who is going to play with three teams in three years, but I don’t think they had another choice.”\nWentz will likely take over the starting role from Taylor Heinicke, who threw for 3,419 yards, 20 touchdowns, and 15 interceptions in 16 games played last season. \nWentz does come with his own questions though, despite a quality statistical season with the Colts in 2021, where he threw for 3,563 yards, 27 touchdowns and seven interceptions in 17 games started.\nThat was highlighted most by a crushing season-ending loss in Week 18 to the 3-14 Jacksonville Jaguars that helped eliminate the Colts from playoff contention. \nInconsistency has been a trademark of Wentz, whose play dropped off in his final year with the Philadelphia Eagles in 2020 as well.\nThat’s the risk the Commanders take, and time will tell if the gamble pays off. \nBut at the NFL’s most important player position, Wentz seems to be an upgrade over Heinicke and will be a better offensive scheme fit, according to former Washington Post and The Athletic writer Mark Bullock. \nBullock says Commanders’ offensive coordinator Scott Turner’s Air Coryell offense, a system dedicated to throwing the ball deep down the field, is a better fit for the stronger-armed Wentz than for Heinicke. \nCommon sense also says that Wentz’s ability to throw deep will work better with speedy wide receiver Terry McLaurin, who has accumulated over 3,000 receiving yards in three seasons with the Commanders. Bullock says Heinicke’s reliance on shorter passes held McLaurin back at times. \nEither way, Washington’s move towards a new quarterback was predictable once last season ended. \nThe Commanders have had quarterback issues for years, and haven’t found even moderate stability there since starter Kirk Cousins left after the 2017 season following three years as the full-time starter with the team. \n“We’re looking at all opportunities there in terms of quarterback…we are looking to upgrade that position and we’re looking at every angle possible,” Washington General Manager Martin Mayhew said at the NFL Combine in March before the deal was announced. “That is a big piece of the puzzle and what we spend there we can’t spend somewhere else.” \nAnd Wentz could be worth his weight in gold, and the Commanders will pay him like it: Wentz is getting $28 million for the 2022 season. In return, Wentz will be under contract for the next three years. \nIf Wentz doesn’t work out in 2022, he has an out in 2023 in his contract that allows the Commanders to release him without spending any more money on him. \nBut as Mayhew said, acquiring Wentz will prevent Washington from spending in other areas of need. To alleviate the hit, Washington recently reportedly released starting safety Landon Collins to clear cap space even though it opened another position for the Commanders to fill. \nWith limited cap space, the Commanders still will look to bring back some of its own free agents like wide-receivers DeAndre Carter and Cam Sims - both potential weapons for Wentz - while also looking for more outside talent."

    "title": "As cryptocurrency market grows, federal and state officials mull tighter controls",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  On the eve of Super Bowl Sunday, during the first rounds of anticipated ads, a QR code bounced around the screens of millions of viewers’ television screens for 60 seconds. \nThe ad, which cost more than $14 million, had been purchased by cryptocurrency company CoinBase. The spot, which also ran during the game, illustrated that the cryptocurrency industry was working to address a new customer base and wasn’t shy about spending millions to do so. \nCryptocurrency and NFTs (non-fungible tokens) have entered the mainstream of the financial world in recent years and the companies behind them are making it easier for investors to trade in both crypto and NFT futures with their computers and smartphones. \nThe use of cryptocurrencies has also been seen as a means of transmitting money to questionable people, organizations, and nations. And that is drawing the attention of federal and state regulators, as well as critics familiar with the issue.\nPresident Joe Biden on Wednesday signed an executive order taking the next steps at strengthening federal oversight of cryptocurrency and protecting consumers from potential fraud. \nFormer Secretary of State Hillary Clinton recently warned that cryptocurrency could be used to channel funds to Russia, even after financial sanctions were imposed following its invasion of Ukraine. \n“I do think that the Treasury Department, I think the Europeans, should look hard at how they can prevent the crypto markets from giving an escape hatch to Russia, both governmental and private transactions in and out of Russia,” Clinton said in a Feb. 28 interview with Rachel Maddow on MSNBC. “I would hope somebody at the Treasury Department is trying to figure out how theyre going to rein in the leaky valves in the crypto market that might allow Russia to escape the full weight of the sanctions.”\nFBI Director Christopher Wray told lawmakers Thursday the intelligence community believes Russia and its allies overestimated their ability to circumvent U.S. economic sanctions through cryptocurrency.\n“We have built up significant expertise, both at the FBI and with some of our partners, and there’ve been some very significant seizures and other efforts that I think have exposed their (attempts to use) cryptocurrency as a way to get around sanctions,” Wray told the Senate Intelligence Committee. \nBeyond the international stage and sanctions against Russia following the invasion of Ukraine, federal officials are raising concerns over the potential for the illicit use of cryptocurrency. \n“We will continue to look at how the sanctions work and evaluate whether or not there are leakages, and we have the possibility to address them,” Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said at the University of Illinois Chicago days before Biden’s order. “I often hear cryptocurrency mentioned and that is a channel to be watched.” \nLawmakers also are concerned about cryptocurrency oversight.\nSen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Maryland, a member of the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee, said Russia is being squeezed financially on multiple fronts.  \n“The U.S. and our NATO allies are punishing the Kremlin with crippling economic sanctions for waging this unprovoked war in Ukraine,” he said in a statement to Capital News Service. “It is encouraging to see private companies joining in the effort, including technology and cryptocurrency firms, to block access to services as well as additional sources of capital.” \nFinancial experts have said that while Russian citizens and businesses could turn to crypto to try to evade sanctions, the volume of the transactions required would likely make them easier to detect. \nCryptocurrency currently is being advertised by the industry as incredibly flexible, with the potential for future uses such as buying of items with NFTs (non-fungible tokens, which are a means of buying the digital certification, or receipt, of anything from a piece of art to a video) as well as paying bills, taxes and other expenses. \nParticipants in the cryptocurrency and NFT industries are also operating in a fast-changing environment, with both state and federal regulations evolving, placing cryptocurrency and NFTs in unknown legal territory.\nWhat regulations already exist governing cryptocurrencies and NFTs vary among the states. \nAaron “Tres” York, associate legislative director for the National Council of State Legislatures (NCSL), said that policymakers and regulators are currently working in a “massive gray area” when it comes to the cryptocurrency market.\n“There seems to be some confusion as to what levels of government should be regulating crypto, whether this is a federal government role,” he said. “Is this a state government role? Who is the appropriate authority?” \nSome firms offer a particular kind of cryptocurrency, known as stablecoins, as a more reliable investment. Stablecoins are backed by assets such as real estate, gold, oil or other commodities.\nStablecoins were the focus of a Feb. 15 Senate banking panel hearing.\n“We do want to encourage innovation. I support that. We also want to make sure that we protect consumers,“ Van Hollen said at the hearing. “Stablecoins are intended to be tied to a stable base. Is there any protection if the stablecoin issuer was to go belly up for consumers?”\nSen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Massachusetts, and also a banking committee member, said at the same hearing she thought stablecoins require different forms of financial regulation.\n“Stablecoins have taken off,” she said. “Their cap is now 35 times what it was just two years ago and instead of being used to pay for goods and services, those billions of dollars worth of stablecoins are used to lubricate speculation in the shadiest part of the crypto ecosystem, where people are lending, leveraging, and trading with no laws and no sheriff anywhere.”\nWarren believes that the stablecoin market could pose a significant risk to the overall financial market and that Congress and regulators need to contain these risks.\nSen. Pat Toomey, R-Pennsylvania, and advocates for stablecoins contend they are an increasingly convenient form of currency. \n“One stablecoin is meant always to be worth $1,” Toomey said at last month’s hearing. “Because of this price stability, stablecoins have the potential to serve all the traditional functions of money by acting as a medium of exchange, unit of account, as well as a store of value.” \nThe senator added that “stablecoins can also improve upon traditional forms of money by increasing payment speed, especially across border transfers, reducing transaction costs, and helping to combat illicit finance through the creation of an immutable and transparent transaction record.” \nFor years, cryptocurrencies have been seen as a volatile and unpredictable market, with huge gains and losses over very short periods of time. \nFor example, a little-known cryptocurrency known as “KokoSwap” saw a rise of 76,200% in a single day last November, jumping from $0.009999 per token to $7.63 per coin in a 24-hour period before declining to a value of $5.85 per token at the end of the trading day. \nIn January, dramatic market declines shaved $1 trillion off the value of the overall crypto market.\nThere is an estimated $2 trillion worth of cryptocurrency currently on the market, an astronomical amount that will require increased oversight by state and federal regulators, the NCSLs Work said. \nJohn Callas, director of technology projects for the non-profit Electronic Frontier Foundation, expressed concern over the absence of consistency in regulations dealing with the cryptocurrency and NFT markets. \n“I think that the current regulations are all over the place, and there are things that were not particularly happy with,” Callas said. \nCallas stated that the blockchain technology, which functions as an encrypted online ledger in which cryptocurrency and NFT transactions are recorded, was providing services that are already in place. \nSecurities and Exchange Commission Chairman Gary Gensler said in a speech last August before the Aspen Security Forum that cryptocurrency is subject to unverifiable claims and lacks transparency. \n“Right now, we just don’t have enough investor protection in crypto,” Gensler said. “Frankly, at this time, it’s more like the Wild West… If we don’t address these issues, I worry a lot of people will be hurt.”"

    "title": "Biden moves to strengthen crypto oversight",
    "content": "WASHINGTON – President Joe Biden signed an executive order Wednesday aimed at strengthening federal oversight of cryptocurrency and protecting consumers from potential fraud.The move marks the most significant effort by the federal government to install guardrails and regulations governing the developing cryptocurrency markets. The executive order:# Directs the Treasury Department to assess potential risks of cryptocurrency and to ensure sufficient regulatory oversight to protect consumers, investors and the economy.# Encourages the Financial Stability Oversight Council to identify systemic financial risks posed by cryptocurrencies and take steps to mitigate such risks.# Directs relevant U.S. agencies to coordinate efforts to combat the illegal use of cyptocurrencies and work with international agencies to do the same.# Directs the federal government to explore the creation of a U.S. Central Bank Digital Currency in the event such an institution is “deemed in the national interest.”Biden’s order “will help position the U.S. to keep playing a leading role in the innovation and governance of the digital assets ecosystem at home and abroad, in a way that protects consumers, is consistent with our democratic values and advances U.S. global competitiveness,” National Economic Council Director Brian Deese and National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said in a joint statement.“We are clear-eyed that ‘financial innovation’ of the past has too often not benefited working families, while exacerbating inequality and increasing systemic financial risk,” Deese and Sullivan said. “This history underscores the need to build robust consumer and economic protections into digital asset development.”Shortly after the executive order was announced, Secretary of the Treasury Janet Yellen said in a statement the White House’s executive order “will support responsible innovation that could result in substantial benefits for the nation, consumers, and businesses.”“Under the executive order, Treasury will partner with interagency colleagues to produce a report on the future of money and payment systems,” Yellen said. Cryptocurrency industry participants praised the executive order, which was seen as offering regulations in a new and unknown segment of the finance industry. “It was better than I thought it was going to be,” Kristin Smith, executive director of the Blockchain Association, a cryptocurrency industry group said. “Given all of the fear, uncertainty, and doubt that has been out there about a regulatory crackdown, I think this is obviously in stark contrast. This is much more positive and thoughtful.”Anchorage Digital co-founder and CEO Nathan McCauley called the executive order a “shot in the arm for crypto” and said that the action offered a balance of “responsible innovation” by the Biden administration. “The crypto community needs to recognize that, for the benefit of our industry, regulators have a role to play in the crypto ecosystem,” McCauley said. “Today’s executive order makes it clear: this isn’t them-against-us.” In a statement on Twitter, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Gary Gensler said he looked forward “to collaborating with colleagues across the government to achieve important public policy goals: protecting investors  consumers, guarding against illicit activity,  helping ensure financial stability.”Some Democratic lawmakers on the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee praised Biden’s order.The panel’s chairman, Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, said in a statement that “it’s imperative we strengthen our financial resilience and national security right now.”“That includes protecting Americans from the risks of crypto to our economy and ensuring crypto can’t be used to skirt the law,” Brown said. “The president is right to take a whole-of-government approach to addressing cryptocurrencies and considering a central bank digital currency.”\nMaryland Democratic Sen. Chris Van Hollen, a member of the banking panel, called Bidens executive order “an appropriate first step on a national framework that will encourage responsible innovation, protect U.S. consumers and investors, and minimize the illicit finance and national security risks posed by digital asset markets.”\nThe number of cryptocurrencies – and the number of Americans trading in them – has grown rapidly in recent years, Van Hollen said in a statement. Yet despite rising use, digital currency markets still lack many of the basic guardrails that our traditional markets have in place to protect consumers. We want to encourage innovation, but we need basic rules of the road to ensure Americans aren’t exposed to unnecessary risk when it comes to their finances. Pennsylvania Sen. Pat Toomey, the ranking Republican on the banking committee, said in a statement he was “encouraged to see the Biden administration acknowledge that digital assets, including cryptocurrencies and the underlying technology, have tremendous potential benefits.”“The executive order also underscores the need for Congress to enact a regulatory framework specific to digital assets,” Toomey added. “This technology empowers individuals, and they deserve to have a say in crafting thoughtful legislation. The administration should resist the urge to stretch existing laws in an effort to expand its regulatory authority.”Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Massachusetts, has been an outspoken critic of the current state of cryptocurrency regulation and is crafting a bill targeting cryptocurrency in the current Russia sanctions. She endorsed Biden’s effort to enhance federal oversight.  “Ive been ringing the alarm bell on crypto, from consumer protection to the environment to national security—especially since Russian elites can use digital assets to undermine sanctions,” Warren tweeted. “@POTUS is right to spotlight crypto’s risks and we need strong rules before it’s too late.”"

    "title": "With House seats up for grabs, calls for redistricting reform grow louder",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  Republican lawmakers in the Maryland state legislature are fighting the Democrats’ newly-proposed congressional districts, drawn to make it nearly impossible for a GOP candidate to win in all but one seat. \nIn Kentucky, Democratic lawmakers are challenging Republican-favored congressional maps in state circuit court. \nIn Ohio, Republicans have crafted a redistricting plan favoring their party in at least 10 of 15 House districts. Now it’s up to the Ohio Supreme Court to decide whether the state GOP violated the state’s constitutional prohibition against gerrymandering. \n“The map news of late is showing to me that our process is quite chaotic and almost kind of arbitrary,” said Ned Foley, who directs Ohio State University’s election law program.  \nAll across the country, states are drawing new congressional district lines ahead of the November midterm elections. Each state is playing by its own rules. And advocates say reforms are long overdue.  \nSome states allow the political parties to draw district maps – and many end up in court challenges by the parties that think they would lose seats. Other states have independent, non-partisan commissions. \n!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var a in e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r=0;r\nOn Monday, the Supreme Court denied a GOP request to block redistricting maps in North Carolina and Pennsylvania, where lower courts have approved them. Despite dire warnings ahead of this cycle that Republican-controlled state legislatures would produce new maps that would put Democrats at a disadvantage, the results apparently haven’t quite worked out that way.\nAfter the Supreme Court’s decision on North Carolina and Pennsylvania, David Wasserman, House editor of the nonpartisan Cook Political Report, tweeted: “This ruling ensures the 2022 House map will be much less skewed towards Republicans than the current one (and perhaps not skewed towards Rs at all).”\nBut Foley told Capital News Service that the system is broken. \n“If you think about redistricting as the first step in the process of democracy and self-government that you have to do every 10 years because of the new census and population shifts, you'd like to think that it could be more orderly and more rational,” he said.\nAlthough some lawmakers have tried to address gerrymandering since the 1980s, Congress has not passed federal redistricting reform that would end partisan map manipulations and the lawsuits that inevitably follow. \n“It's really important that our policymakers recognize where things stand because democracy is a very fragile thing,” said Yurij Rudensky, senior counsel at the Brennan Center for Justice in New York. “And it's under unprecedented strain right now and it's clear who is being targeted and what the stakes are.”\n\nCongressional elections are less competitive after Republicans drew in advantages for the GOP during the 2010 redistricting cycle. Votes don’t always determine an election since some districts are now exclusively safe for Republicans or Democrats, depending on the state. \nThe once-in-a-decade redistricting process is considered by many observers as a free-for-all in which districts are carefully revised to benefit whichever party is in control of the state legislature. \nThis isn’t a new phenomenon. Drawing congressional maps to benefit a political party, also known as gerrymandering, has been around since the birth of the United States. \n\"Both parties are executing their strategies,” Adam Kincaid, executive director of the National Republican Redistricting Trust, told CBS News. “We've been saying all along, we're just taking seats off the board and going on offense where possible. And they've been doing the same.\" \nThe National Democratic Redistricting Committee says its strategy protects communities of color, which are targets of GOP map-drawers.\n“In state after state, Democrats are drawing maps that reflect the population trends in the census,” Brooke Lillard, deputy communications director for the Democrats’ redistricting arm, said in an email. \n“The will of the voters be damned – that’s the Republican approach,” she said. \nIn Maryland, the Republicans are upset over district maps that they say are drawn to favor Democrats. \nSeven of the state’s eight House seats are held by Democrats and the maps that would govern the next 10 years would not change that. In fact, the new districts would make the one held by the only Republican, Rep. Andy Harris, more competitive.\nTwo lawsuits challenging the maps currently are moving through the Anne Arundel Circuit Court. \nNationwide, both parties are intensifying their efforts to gain advantage. They have created groups such as the National Republican Redistricting Trust and the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, to support redistricting goals and strategies. Groups like the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee have raised millions to prep state legislatures. “Dark money” groups that don’t disclose their donors have poured thousands of dollars into efforts to influence map drawing this cycle, OpenSecrets reported. \nBut advocates for reform say the gerrymandering that maps are undergoing this cycle is the worst they’ve seen. \n“It's in this moment where we are seeing unprecedented assaults, incredibly aggressive gerrymandering that are targeting communities of color,” Rudensky said. \nIn the 1980s, Republicans including now-Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, led the redistricting reform effort in Congress. Back then, the GOP was struggling to get more House seats. Today, it’s Democrats on the Hill pushing for reform and wanting to carve out more power for the next decade.\n“It's the ones with the power (who) don't want to give it up,” said Sara Sadhwani, an associate political science professor at Pomona College in California. \nRep. Jim Cooper, D-Tennessee, thinks passing reforms would be difficult in any Congress. \n“The dirty secret is that both parties love gerrymandering if they're on top,” Cooper told CNS. “They hate it when they're on the bottom.”\nA veteran of 32 years in the House, Cooper is retiring because Tennessee Republicans sliced his Nashville district into three pieces. \nThe next push for reform should be an individual bill to avoid what happened with a comprehensive election and voting reform measure called the For the People Act, Foley said. \nPartisan gerrymandering would have been banned in the For the People Act. But the overall bill stalled in the Senate because Democratic Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona did not back it. \nThe push for a compromise bill – partly led by Manchin - included reform that gave states more choice in what redistricting process they implement. But that approach was blocked by Senate Republicans.  \nCooper, who introduced reform that would require states to use independent commissions to redraw maps, said it’s difficult to find even one Republican to support federal redistricting reform. No Republicans in the House co-sponsored Cooper’s bill.\n“Find me a live Republican who’s willing to do this,” Cooper said. “They are very good at party unity. It’s going to be really hard to find one willing to (stray from the party line). They rarely do that sort of thing.” \nSome point to state courts and ballot initiatives to fill in gaps that federal reform would address, but it’s still not enough, according to Sadhwani. \n“It really comes down to whether or not the people can have a say,” said Sadhwani, who was on California’s independent commission this cycle. “Not all states even allow ballot measures. So it's a pipe dream in many places, unless there's federal action.”\nRudensky said that regardless of current safeguards like state court litigation and ballot measures some states have instituted in the redistricting process, Congress still needs to provide some kind of national standards when it comes to how states draw new lines. \nAnd without guidance from Congress, relying on the courts can be a problematic strategy, Foley said. \nCourts can allow bad maps to get through, Rudensky said, using Alabama’s latest map developments as an example. \nLast month, the Supreme Court’s 5-4 ruling reinstated disputed maps that were challenged for disenfranchising voters of color in Alabama for this year’s election. \nBut the Supreme Court can’t step in on cases of partisan gerrymandering. The court gave up the legal authority to rule on cases of partisan gerrymandering after a 2019 ruling involving Republicans in North Carolina and Democrats in Maryland. \nHowever, the high court still does hear cases involving racial gerrymandering, which could potentially violate the Voting Rights Act. \nMost of those advocating reform believe each state should have an independent, non-partisan commission to draw new district lines and take map-drawing power away from political parties. \nThere is a connection between more fair, competitive maps and the independent commissions that draw them, said Chris Warshaw, an expert on redistricting who teaches political science at The George Washington University in the nation’s capital. \n“Even states that are otherwise controlled by Republicans, you don't see a big Republican skew in the map if there's a nonpartisan commission,” Warshaw said. \nFederal redistricting guidance will further support the principles of democracy, Rudensky said. \n“It is critical to revamp the systems to create new safeguards,” Rudensky said. “There's quite literally just nothing more important than ensuring that the public has full faith and trust and connection to our government, which is, of course, supposed to be a representative one where all communities are able to secure their fair share of political influence and of resources.”"

    "title": "Biden cuts off Russian oil and gas imports to U.S.",
    "content": "WASHINGTON – President Joe Biden signed an executive order Tuesday banning the importation of Russian oil, natural gas, and coal imports to the United States in response to the invasion of Ukraine. \nIn the toughest sanction imposed by the United States so far, the president’s order banned:\n# The import into the United States of Russian crude oil and certain petroleum products, liquefied natural gas, and coal\n# New U.S. investment in Russia’s energy sector\n# Financing or enabling foreign companies that are making investments to produce energy in Russia\n“Today, I am announcing the United States is targeting the main artery of Russia’s economy,” Biden said in remarks delivered in the White House’s Roosevelt Room. “That means Russian oil will no longer be acceptable at U.S. ports and the American people will deal another powerful blow to Putin’s war machine.”\nSince the Russian invasion, two million people have fled Ukraine. While Ukrainian resistance has been fierce, Russian forces continue to try to gain territory, shelling cities and cutting off vital services. \nIn a tweet following Biden’s announcement of the oil sanctions, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy expressed his appreciation.\n“Thankful for US and @POTUS personal leadership in striking in the heart of Putin’s war machine and banning oil, gas and coal from US market. Encourage other countries and leaders to follow, Zelenskyy tweeted. \n!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var a in e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r=0;r\nIn an attempt to inflict an additional financial burden on the Russian economy, Biden called on Congress to pass a $12 billion assistance package to Ukraine. The package includes additional defensive weapons as well as “tens of thousands of tons of food, water, and medical supplies” for the war-torn nation. \n“Over the last two weeks, Ukrainian people have inspired the world,” Biden said. “They've inspired the world with their bravery, their patriotism, their defiant determination to live free.” \nGas prices have hit an all-time high this week. As of Tuesday, the average national gas price was $4.173, up 75 cents since Russian leader Vladimir Putin began amassing troops at the Ukrainian borders, Biden said. Additionally, the average gas price in Maryland is $4.192, according to AAA. \n!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var a in e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r=0;r\nSome major business groups endorsed Biden’s announcement. Major companies such as Visa, MasterCard, American Express, Ford, Nike, and Apple have suspended their services in Russia. \nMcDonald’s announced Tuesday it was closing all 850 of its Russian outlets but would continue paying the 62,000 Russian employees. Starbucks, Coca-Cola and Pepsi-Cola also suspended sales in Russia.\n“We applaud the administration for banning Russian energy imports,” Martin Durbin, president of  U.S. Chamber of Commerce’s Global Energy Institute, said in a statement. “It’s time now for the administration to partner with domestic energy producers to leverage America’s ability to produce more oil and gas and focus on pro-growth policies to benefit our economy and the world’s security.” \nThe Natural Resources Defense Council, a non-profit international environmental advocacy group, also approved of Biden’s latest move and emphasized the need to reduce national reliance on oil and gas.\n“This is the right thing to do. Russia is using oil and gas money to help fund this brutal invasion,” John Bowman, managing director for government affairs, said in a statement. “One of the most important measures we can take right now is to reduce our dependence, at home and abroad, on the oil and gas that’s helping to bankroll the Russian military. That means shifting away from the fossil fuels that lock in dependence on belligerent petro states and drive us toward climate catastrophe.”\nBiden said the United States will move without some European allies due to disagreements among those nations about banning Russian energy imports. Europe is much more dependent than the United States on Russian oil and gas. But the president emphasized that “we remain united in our purpose to keep pressure mounting on Putin and his war machine.”\nSupport for the White House move was bipartisan on Capitol Hill.\n House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Mechanicsville, tweeted: “I applaud @POTUS taking steps this morning to ban American imports of Russian oil  gas. Congress continues to closely monitor this conflict  will take action to ban Russian oil today.”\n“America is saying ‘nyet’ to Russian fossil fuels,” Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-New York, tweeted. “By banning the import of Russian oil, coal, and gas into the U.S., @POTUS continues to hit Putin where it hurts. This action sends a clear signal that Americans will not fund Putin’s unprovoked and illegal invasion of Ukraine.” \nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, said on Twitter that he, too, “strongly” backed the sanctions. But he added: We must also recognize that the past year of bad policies from this anti-domestic-energy Administration will make this necessary step more painful than it had to be. Democrats must let Americans produce American energy.”\nRep. John Sarbanes, D-Baltimore, also endorsed Biden’s action.\n“President Biden made the right decision to ban Russian oil and gas imports today. We must use every tool available to isolate Putin and increase economic pressure on Russia,” Sarbanes said in a statement. \nBiden assured the public in his speech that paying more at the pump was a temporary sacrifice to help the war effort in Ukraine. \n“People everywhere are speaking up for freedom. When the history of this war is written, Putin's war in Ukraine will have left Russia weaker, and the rest of the world stronger,” the president said."

    "title": "Biden administration preps new rules covering sexual misconduct",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  The Biden administration is expected to propose new rules this spring aimed at reversing the controversial Trump administration regulations governing the rights of those accused of sexual misconduct in colleges and schools.\nThen-Education Secretary Betsy DeVos in 2017 set off a firestorm over new rules under Title IX that gave additional legal protections to accused offenders.\nThe Trump White House contended that colleges and universities have often stacked the deck against the accused, failing to offer protections such as a presumption of innocence or adequate ability to rebut allegations. But critics denounced the shift, saying the new policies could lead to courtroom-like hearings where accusers could be cross-examined over their credibility. Some observers said the changes would lead to scores of lawsuits. \nPresident Joe Biden was critical of the regulations during his presidential campaign, saying that “survivors deserve to be treated with dignity and respect, and when they step forward they should be heard, not silenced,” and he promised he would put a “quick end” to it if he was elected.\nBiden signed an executive order on March 8, 2021, instructing the education secretary to review existing regulations “as soon as practicable, and as appropriate and consistent with applicable law.”\nThe Department of Education confirmed to Capital News Service that the notice is expected in the spring and “will provide the public an opportunity to comment and will precede the issuance of a final rule.”\nThe new policies are also expected to create additional protections for LGBTQ+ students, according to Biden’s executive order.\nTitle IX, a federal civil rights law passed in 1972, prohibits sex-based discrimination in schools or educational settings that receive funding from the federal government.\nIn 2018, Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Connecticut, was one of many members of Congress to speak out against the regulations implemented by the Trump administration, saying that DeVos was “on the side of those accused rather than the victims.” DeLauro said she worried that her proposed rules would “remove policies that hold perpetrators accountable and help ensure schools are maintaining a safe environment for their students.”\nFour years later, DeLauro said she is looking forward to the release of new rules.\n“I am encouraged by the Biden administration’s plans to undo the previous administration’s harmful, unjust Title IX policies,” DeLauro told CNS. “Through the rulemaking process, revisions to enforcement, and updates to case processing, the Department of Education must restore critical protections for student survivors of sexual assault and sexual harassment.”\nMajor educational organizations including the National Education Association (NEA) have spoken out against DeVos’ regulations. In a 2018 statement, NEA President Lily Eskelsen García said that the “Trump-DeVos agenda would return schools to a time when rape, assault, and harassment were swept under the rug.”\nRep. Virginia Foxx, R-North Carolina, supported the Trump administration regulations. She argued in a statement a year ago that it took DeVos nearly three years to get the Title IX changes “right.” \nFoxx opposed Biden’s executive order.\n“The right to due process is bigger than partisan politics  it is a cornerstone of American democracy,” the congresswoman said in a March 2021 statement. “By overturning these stakeholder-vetted, court-supported rules, key protections for victims and the due process rights of the accused would be jeopardized.”\nIt’s On Us, a national sexual assault prevention organization, along with other similar groups, created the #EdActNow campaign to petition the Department of Education to issue proposed changes as early as October 2021, and until then, to not enforce the Devos rule. \nHowever, the 2020 regulations are still in place and will be in effect until new rules are passed by the Department of Education.\nTracey Vitchers, executive director of It’s On Us, said she was upset when the Department of Education was not able to meet the October deadline. She told CNS she believes part of the reason lies with the Senate delaying the confirmation of Catherine Lhamon, narrowly confirmed last October as the Education Department’s assistant secretary for civil rights. \nLhamon served as assistant secretary under the Obama administration and worked on guidance that created protections for transgender students in schools and set out how schools should investigate Title IX claims. These were among the guidelines repealed by the Trump administration. \nVitchers said she hopes that the Biden administration puts forward a rule that takes into consideration how traumatic sexual violence can be for survivors and that will emphasize reporting and holding accountable schools that have “a culture of violence on campus.”\n“I also am hopeful that them taking the amount of additional time that they have results in a stronger rule, results in a rule change that is effective, is supportive of student safety and survivor rights,” she said.\nVitchers said she has seen the harm that the existing regulations have caused. She specifically highlighted “equity issues” within the reporting process, including how schools are prevented from taking anything seen as disciplinary action on students who are accused of sexual misconduct until they have gone through the full “investigative and adjudicated process.”\n“Student survivors on campus are like, ‘Well, why is so-and-so, who we know has been accused of sexual assault, still playing the football game on Saturday?’ Its because the investigation has not been completed,” Vitchers said. “The coach’s hands are tied because prohibiting that student from competition because of the allegations of sexual assault could be interpreted as unwarranted disciplinary action that violates the accused students rights.” \nVichers also highlighted the inequities within the live cross-examination process at Title IX hearings that the 2020 rules laid out. \nAdvocacy groups and individuals sued the Department of Education over the 2020 rules, claiming that the agency violated the Administrative Procedure Act and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fifth Amendment. While the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts upheld most of the rules put in effect under DeVos, the court invalidated one part that prohibited “decision-makers in Title IX proceedings” from “considering any ‘statement’ from a person who did not submit to cross-examination at the live hearing.”\nThe court called the provision “arbitrary and capricious” and underscored how respondents could schedule live hearings at inconvenient times or talk witnesses out of attending hearings and “rest easy knowing that the school could not subpoena other witnesses to appear.”\nAs of August 24, 2021, the Department of Education has not enforced parts of the rules that the court vacated. However, all other provisions put in place by the Trump Administration remain in effect until new rules are announced. \nBackers of the Trump rules are not eager to see major changes. \nThe 2020 regulations brought “balance to campus proceedings” by including procedural protections for accused students, according to Joe Cohn, the legislative  policy director for the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education (FIRE). FIRE is a non-profit and non-partisan organization that advocates for student and faculty individual rights at colleges and universities.\n“The 2020 regulations were extremely helpful…because prior to the regulations, there were minimal if any rights for accused students that were required by the federal government,” Cohn told CNS. “The only way to secure particular due process proceedings was to sue after the fact when basic procedural protections were skipped.”\nData on the impact of the regulations isn’t widely available yet due to the COVID-19 pandemic, according to Cohn. \n“For most of 2020 and 2021 schools were remote,” Cohn said. “So data on decreased or increased reports is unreliable because there were too many other variables to really draw any conclusions from.”\nCohn said he hopes that the new regulations will constitute modest changes. \n“Were happy to work with this administration if theyre really serious about having a policy that respects the rights of all students,” he said. “We hope they go that route instead of deciding to just play ping pong with Title IX policy.”\nVitchers said she also recognized that Title IX regulations regarding sexual assault and sexual harassment have turned into a political back-and-forth. Since 2011, the regulations have been rewritten multiple times and have generated campaign promises to undo or redo specific provisions, by the administrations of Barack Obama, Trump and now Biden. \n“Sexual assault does not care if you are a Democrat or Republican…so the fact that Betsy DeVos and the Trump administration turned it into this political issue that it never should have been, was really harmful,” Vitchers said. “My hope is that with the rule change, we will return to a rule that is fundamentally grounded in upholding students civil rights and campus safety at large because thats what Title IX is about.”"

    "title": "Biden taps Jackson to serve as first Black woman on Supreme Court",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  President Joe Biden on Friday nominated Ketanji Brown Jackson to the Supreme Court, making her the first Black woman to be nominated to the nation’s highest court.\nJackson, 51, would fill the seat of Justice Stephen Breyer, who announced his retirement in late January. Jackson previously worked as a law clerk for Breyer.\n“Its time that we have a court that reflects the full talents and greatness of our nation with a nominee of extraordinary qualifications, and that we inspire all young people to believe that they can one day serve their country at the highest level,” Biden said as he introduced Jackson in the White House’s Cross Hall. “Ive admired these traits of pragmatism, historical perspective, wisdom, character in a jurist nominated by Republican presidents as well as Democratic presidents.”\nWhen Jackson gave her thanks to her family, friends and colleagues she addressed Breyer, and said: “Justice Breyer, the members of the Senate will decide if I fill your seat, but please know that I could never fill your shoes.”\nJackson now faces a divided Senate during her confirmation. She has received bipartisan support three previous times, most recently during last year’s Senate confirmation for the U.S. Court of Appeals, when three Republicans voted for her.\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, who voted against Jackson last year, promised in a statement a “rigorous, exhaustive review of Judge Jackson’s nomination.”\n“I also understand Judge Jackson was the favored choice of far-left dark-money groups that have spent years attacking the legitimacy and structure of the court itself,” McConnell said.\nA fundraising email from the National Republican Congressional Committee blistered Jackson as “a radical leftist who wants to tear our Constitution to shreds.”\nBy contrast, Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley, the ranking Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, was more measured in his statement.\n“Justices must have an unwavering commitment to the Constitution  including its limitations on the power of the courts,” the senator said. “A justice must also be an unfailing defender of the institution of the court, as Justice Breyer has been. As I always have, I’ll make my determination based on the experience, qualifications, temperament and judicial philosophy of the nominee.”\nUnderstandably, congressional Democrats offered strong praise for Biden’s choice.\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-New York, promised “a fair, timely, and expeditious process,” an obvious reference to the quick confirmations by a GOP-controlled Senate of President Donald Trump’s three high court picks.\n“The historic nomination of Judge Jackson is an important step toward ensuring the Supreme Court reflects the nation as a whole,” Schumer said in a statement. “As the first Black woman Supreme Court Justice in the Court’s 232-year-history, she will inspire countless future generations of young Americans.”\n“Now more than ever, Americans need a Supreme Court that will uphold the promise enshrined above its doors: equal justice under law,” Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Maryland, said in a statement. ​​”Ketanji Brown Jackson’s record and experience show she is the right person to help keep that promise.”\nSen. Ben Cardin, D-Maryland, who as then-chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee presided over Jackson’s 2009 confirmation hearing for the U.S. Sentencing Commission, said she “has an extremely impressive background and legal credentials.”\n“It is long past time for the Supreme Court to seat a highly qualified Black female attorney as a member, as we strive to provide equal justice under law to all Americans,” Cardin said in a statement.\nHouse Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Mechanicsville, offered his “strong support” for Jackson in a statement. He urged the Senate to expeditiously consider her nomination and confirm Jackson with bipartisan support before the Supreme Court starts its next term in October.\nAfter being nominated by then-President Barack Obama in 2009 and unanimously confirmed by the Senate, Jackson served until 2014 as the vice chair of the U.S. Sentencing Commission, the agency responsible for setting federal sentencing guidelines.\nObama then nominated Jackson to a judgeship on the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. She was confirmed in 2013.\nWhile a district court judge, Jackson ruled that provisions of three executive orders, signed by Trump, were invalid. The provisions would have limited union rights restricting the amount of time union delegates could meet with those they were representing.\nIn September 2019, while hearing a case over a Department of Homeland Security rule that fast-tracked the deportation of undocumented immigrants without immigration court hearings, Jackson issued a preliminary injunction to block the action.\n“She understands the broader impact of the decisions, whether its cases addressing the rights of workers or government service,” Biden said. “She cares about making sure that our democracy works for the American people.”\nMark Graber, a regents professor at the University of Maryland’s Carey School of Law, said that Jackson probably will not be very influential in her first years, with the caveat that no nominee would.\nHer distinctive form of liberalism will have an impact in five to 10 years – if liberals gain a fifth seat on the court, he said.\n“Right now, what we can expect is at every point where Breyer voted, erase Breyers name and substitute her,” he said.\nGraber, who teaches constitutional law and politics, said Jackson is a solid liberal but predicted she wouldn’t be a radical.\nBiden’s nominee drew praise and support from the National Bar Association, the League of Women Voters, People for the American Way, the Center for American Progress and the NAACP, among other groups.\n“We need Black women at every level of the judiciary, and especially on the highest court of the land, said NAACP general counsel Janette McCarthy Wallace in a statement. Beginning with Judge Jane Bolin and Judge Constance Baker Motley, Black women have been highly qualified and exceptional judges.”\nJackson noted during her White House remarks that she shares a birthday with Motley, the nation’s first Black female federal judge. Motley’s life has been an inspiration, she said.\n“Today, I proudly stand on Judge Motleys shoulders, sharing not only her birthday, but also her steadfast and courageous commitment to equal justice under law,” Jackson said.\nThe nominee was joined by her youngest daughter Leila, and her husband, Patrick, the chief of gastrointestinal surgery at Medstar Georgetown University Hospital in Washington. Her eldest daughter Talia, who is attending school in Rhode Island, was not in attendance.\n“I can only hope that my life and career, my love of this country and the Constitution, and my commitment to upholding the rule of law and the sacred principles upon which this great nation was founded, will inspire future generations of Americans,” Jackson said."

    "title": "‘Putin chose this war’: Biden imposes new sanctions on Russia for Ukraine invasion",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  President Joe Biden on Thursday imposed a new round of financial and economic-based sanctions on Russia as its forces launched attacks on Ukrainian cities, including its capital, Kyiv.\n“Putin is the aggressor,” Biden said in remarks in the White House’s East Room. “Putin chose this war. And now he and his country will bear the consequences.”\nBiden said he will use sanctions to freeze every asset Russia has in America.  \nThe sanctions include:\n\nLimiting Russia’s ability to do business in dollars, euros, pounds, and yen.\nBlocking access to assets held by Russian elites and their family members\nLimiting Russia’s ability to finance and grow the Russian military.\nLimiting Russia’s ability to compete in the high-tech sector by cutting off more than half of that nation’s high-tech imports.\nFreezing the assets of four more major Russian banks. \n\nBiden said that the new sanctions will “impose severe costs on the Russian economy, both immediately and over time.”\nBiden spoke with G7 leaders Thursday morning and said they are “in full total agreement” on these new sanctions. He said they have already seen the impact of these sanctions. \n\nBefore the invasion, Russia had positioned more than 175,000 troops with equipment along the Ukraine border.\nBiden’s latest sanctions, following others imposed Tuesday, drew mixed reviews from Capitol Hill, foreign policy experts and Ukraine advocates.\n“President Putin will pay a heavy price for incursions in Ukraine, and we will make sure of that,” Sen. Ben Cardin, D-Maryland, said in a statement on Twitter. “The key to sanctions is to keep them in effect until Russia changes its behavior. Russia can withstand for some time, but there will come a point where the country will feel the impact.”\nHouse Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Mechanicsville, said in a statement that the invasion reflects Putin’s desire for “the reimposition of the Soviet Union sphere of influence.”\n“Today he has proven that he will spare nothing to meet this end,” Hoyer said. “His military invasion of his democratic neighbor is a rejection of the will of its people, who have fought hard for the past decade for their independence. President Biden and our allies responded with a unified voice, imposing painful and punishing sanctions. We have provided lethal arms to help its people defend themselves against Russian aggression and will continue to offer material and other support as Ukrainians defend their nation.” \nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-California, said in a statement that “the response of America and our allies will be severe, ongoing and devastating for Russia, economically, diplomatically, and strategically.”\n“President Biden has made clear throughout Russia’s escalation that we will continue to impose costs on Russia that will leave it weakened in every way,” the speaker said. “These include the further steps announced today of sweeping and catastrophic sanctions on financial institutions, companies and individuals critical to the Russian economy and of further military support to bolster NATO.”\nMichael McFaul, former U.S. ambassador to Russia in the Obama administration, tweeted that the latest sanctions package “is severe.”\n“At the same time, no one should have any illusions that these sanctions will change Putins thinking or actions anytime soon,” McFaul said. “Their effectiveness, tragically, will have to be measured over years, not weeks or months.\nBut Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, was critical of the Biden administration’s handling of the Ukraine crisis.\n“Sadly, deterrence after the fact is not deterrence at all,” McConnell said in a statement. “The president should have exercised his extensive authorities to impose certain tough sanctions early enough to actually deter invasion and weaken Russia.”\n“We should have ensured that the pipeline of lethal aid to Ukraine was flowing far sooner,” the GOP leader added. “And we should have sent more reinforcements to support NATO’s eastern flank allies earlier.”\nBiden said Putin has a “sinister vision for the future of our world.” He said if Russia pursues cyber attacks on U.S. companies or infrastructure, he is prepared to respond.\n“As I make crystal clear, the United States will defend every inch of NATO territory with the full force of American power,” the president warned. “Our forces are not going to Europe to fight in Ukraine but to defend our NATO allies and reassure those allies in the east.”\nRoxolana Wynar, an organizer for United Help Ukraine, called Putin “very self-centered and egotistical.” Wynar said Biden’s explanation of the sanctions was “weak.”\n“I’m really worried to be honest,” Wynar told Capital News Service. “I personally have my family and friends in Ukraine, and more of the people like my family, they have nowhere to go.”\nWynar also said that she would prefer that the United States and the European Union sanction Russia’s involvement in the SWIFT banking system — a step that would cripple that nations involvement in international business relations. \nReuters reported the EU is unlikely to eliminate Russia’s involvement in SWIFT at the moment, and Biden mentioned it was an option, but made clear there was not universal agreement on that step. \n“I think the package of sanctions that the president announced is the most severe weve ever levied against Russia,” Rep. Adam Schiff, D-California, and chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said in an interview with MSNBC. “Nevertheless, I favor going further. I favor expelling them from SWIFT, I favor imposing sanctions directly on Vladimir Putin.”\nWhen asked whether he would impose sanctions on Putin, Biden said that option was “on the table” but did not elaborate further. \n“America stands up to bullies. We stand up for freedom,” Biden said. “I know this is hard. Americans are already hurting. I will do everything in my power to limit the pain the American people are feeling.”"

    "title": "Maryland Democrats back Biden&#8217;s sanctions on Russia",
    "content": "WASHINGTON   After President Biden announced the first round of sanctions on Russia Tuesday after its latest invasion of Ukraine, some of Maryland’s lawmakers joined other congressional leaders in backing the administration’s steps and calling out Russian President Vladimir Putin for violating international law. \n“We stand shoulder to shoulder with our Allies in support of Ukraine, its people and its sovereignty,” Rep. John Sarbanes, D-Baltimore, said in a statement on Twitter. “Vladimir Putin must be held accountable for rejecting diplomacy and the rule of law. This is about peace, stability and democracy worldwide.”\nSen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Maryland, said the sanctions, taken along with those by U.S. allies, not only send a clear signal to Putin but will also impose immediate costs on the Russian regime.\nI agree wholeheartedly with President Biden’s commitment to imposing further waves of punishing sanctions should Putin continue to reject diplomacy and further escalate this conflict, Van Hollen said in a statement. As my colleagues and I discussed with our allies at this weekend’s Munich Security Conference, we must continue working in concert with our NATO and other partners to ensure Russia pays a steep price for its hostile and destabilizing actions.”\nBiden said that Putin’s movement of troops into parts of eastern Ukraine controlled by Russian-backed separatists required the United States and its European Union allies to impose sanctions.\n“This is the beginning of a Russian invasion of Ukraine,” the president said in an address from the White House’s East Room.\nThe sanctions include: \n\nFreezing the assets of the Russian bank VEB (Vnesheconombank) and prohibiting U.S. individuals and businesses from doing business with the institution and blocking it from participating in the global financial system \nFreezing the assets of Russia’s military bank (Promsvyazbank) and imposing the same prohibitions on the institution as on VEB\nBlocking western financiers from funding Russian sovereign debt \nBlocking access to U.S. assets by Russian elites (oligarchs) and their family members\n\n“There’s no question that Russia is the aggressor. So we’re clear-eyed about the challenges we’re facing,” Biden said. “There is still time to avert the worst-case scenario that will bring untold suffering to millions of people if they move as suggested.”\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-California, who just led a congressional delegation to the United Kingdom, Germany and Israel, issued a statement calling Putins moves into Ukraine a clear attack by Russia on Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.\nShe endorsed Bidens sanctions, adding: “As was clear throughout the entirety of our travels: if Putin’s goal was to divide allied nations, he only served to unite and strengthen the NATO alliance. The United States and our transatlantic allies stand together in our unwavering commitment to supporting the people of Ukraine and to countering Russian aggression.\nBiden’s briefing came after Putin over several weeks deployed more than 150,000 Russian troops and equipment to the Ukrainian border and began moving troops into two Ukrainian provinces on Monday. \nBiden said that although the United States has no intention of fighting Russia, he is moving additional troops and equipment to protect Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, Baltic nations that, like Ukraine, once were part of the Soviet Union that many foreign observers believe Putin is trying to reassemble.  \n“We want to send an unmistakable message, though, that the United States, together with our Allies, will defend every inch of NATO territory and abide by the commitments we made to NATO,” Biden said.\nThe sanctions also follow Putin’s recognition of Donetsk and Luhansk People’s Republics, which currently are controlled by Russian-backed separatists, as “independent,” according to the White House.\nHouse Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Mechanicsville, said Putin’s claims to “independent” territories “violate Ukraine’s sovereignty” and “open the door to further invasion.” \n“He does not care an iota about the people living in the Donbas,” Hoyer said in a statement, “his declarations serve only the cause of his own ambitions to restore Russian domination over the peoples of Eastern Europe and stamp out the hard-won democracy in Ukraine, which he perceives as a threat to his autocratic rule in Russia.” \nRep. Anthony Brown, D-Upper Marlboro, said on MSNBC that the sanctions reflected a measured approach and were very appropriate.\nBut weve got to be ready to inflict economic distress on the Russian economy and if necessary the Russian people if Putin refuses to respond to the new sanctions and continues to pursue the invasion of Ukraine, Brown said.\nRep. David Trone, D-Potomac, expressed alarm to Capital News Service about the evolving situation. He said as a member of the Congressional Ukraine Caucus, he is committed to working to protect freedom and democracy in Ukraine.\n“Like many Americans, I am deeply concerned about the evolving situation in Ukraine, the safety of the Ukrainian people, and the security of our own citizens working in the region,” Trone said. “I have full confidence in our national security team at the White House, and I sincerely hope we will be able to resolve this issue peacefully and diplomatically.”\nRep. Dutch Ruppersberger, D-Cockeysville, called the new sanctions a “strong start” and urged Putin to pursue diplomacy to resolve the crisis. \n“As President Biden said today, Russia has unequivocally violated international law by invading sovereign Ukrainian territory,” Ruppersberger said in a statement to CNS. “Russia’s continued aggression should not be promoted as peacekeeping…It is Putin’s choice and I urge him to choose diplomacy for the sake of his people.”\nThe U.S. sanctions are the latest efforts to dissuade Russia from a larger invasion. His troops have occupied Ukraine’s Crimea since 2014.\nGermany announced a stop to the development and certification of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which would have increased the amount of Russian natural gas distributed throughout Europe. The European Union and the United Kingdom separately announced sanctions as well.  \nIn an MSNBC interview following Biden’s remarks, Sen. Bob Menendez, D-New Jersey, said that he supported targeting Russian financial institutions for sanctions.\n“VEB bank is one of the most substantial banks. It was on my list of banks in my legislation that I wanted to sanction,” said Menendez, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. “This is a matter that is definitely going to hurt.” \nBiden said the United States will continue to provide defensive assistance to Ukraine and will impose additional sanctions on Russia if the conflict persists.\n“We’re united in our support of Ukraine. Were united in our opposition to Russian aggression.  And we’re united in our resolve to defend our NATO Alliance,” the president said. “And were united in our understanding of the urgency and seriousness of the threat Russia is making to global peace and stability.”"

    "title": "Frontier-Spirit merger, Southwest to be main competitors at BWI",
    "content": "BALTIMORE – The recently announced merger between Frontier Airlines and Spirit Airlines will create the second-largest airline carrier at Baltimore/Washington Thurgood Marshall Airport, but some critics say the proposed combination carrier would affect fares and service adversely.\nIn addition, the merger could hit a roadblock with the Biden administration’s Justice Department, which already has taken aggressive steps against other airlines for what it sees as anti-competitive business practices. \nThe merger, valued at $6.6 billion, would create the fifth-largest U.S. airline carrier and is slated to close in the second half of 2022. It is the first merger of large U.S. airlines since Alaska Airlines and Virgin America in 2016 and U.S. Airways and American Airlines in 2013.\nFrontier Board of Directors Chairman William Franke said the merger would create “America’s most competitive ultra-low fare airline for the benefit of consumers.”\nBut consumer advocates hope the Justice Department’s Antitrust Division will test that claim before clearing the new carrier for takeoff. The Antitrust Division did not respond to a request for comment. \n“I think that the Department of Justice is going to take a long look at it,” John Breyault, vice president of public policy, telecommunications and fraud at the National Consumers League, told Capital News Service. “The environment under which the Department of Justice is going to review this merger is very different than it was under the previous administration.”\nBreyault said he doesn’t believe it will lead to better service. He said the consolidation of the two airlines only hurts consumers more as the “nickel and dime” style of the airlines may be intensified.\nDiana Moss, president of the non-partisan American Antitrust Institute, agreed.\n“Frontier and Spirit, as ultra low-cost carriers, inject important competitive discipline into domestic passenger markets,” she told Travel Weekly. “Without that dynamic, the Big Four will be even less restrained in coordinating to set fares, ancillary fees and quality of service.”\nAmerican, Southwest, Delta Air Lines and United Airlines account for more than 80% of U.S. air travel.\nFrontier and Spirit both serve BWI. Airport spokesman Jonathan Dean called both airlines “valued partners” in a statement to CNS.\nSpirit Airlines currently offers service to 15 markets from BWI, while Frontier offers service to five destinations. \n!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var a in e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r=0;r\nBWI is a hub for Southwest Airlines, which is the dominant carrier at that airport. The Frontier-Spirit merger would not change that. \n“No one is going to displace Southwest at Baltimore. That’s clear,” said Robert Mann Jr., president of R.W. Mann Co., Inc., and an airline industry analyst. “But the combination of Spirit and Frontier would be significantly larger at Baltimore and represent a better set of services for any prospective customer.” \nMann said that in any hub, the dominant carrier, in this case Southwest Airlines, “sets the tone” for the airport. He said the secondary carrier would have a role and any other carrier would act as a “bystander.”\nMann agrees that the combined airline may face difficulties from regulators. \n“There will be a lot of folks who don’t want this to happen because it represents the potential for a significant disruption of air business,” Mann said. \nMann said both Frontier and Spirit are known for their low fares, so he suspects that those who oppose a merger will suggest that the combination will cause the carriers to give up their low-fare branding. He said the existing customer structure of the two airlines attracts infrequent and leisure travelers.\n“Given that this carrier is significantly lower fare, in almost all instances than any other carrier, including Southwest, the likelihood is that we would see some gravitation toward the combination by price-seeking business travelers,” Mann said.\nPhil Maroun, principal at Renaissance Strategic Advisors in Arlington, Virginia, said there are still some questions about what the merger will entail.\n“A consolidation of these two would probably improve fares and the number of flights per day…but no deal is done until it’s approved and there’s always things that can change the outcome,” Maroun said.\nThe merger gives Frontier a 51.5% controlling stake and Spirit a 48.5% stake. Analysts said it is too soon to tell how airline fares might be affected.\n“It’s really unknown what this new set of regulators in this… administration are looking for because we haven’t had this case appear so far,” Mann said. “This will be a precedent case and I guess we’ll see what’s interesting to these regulators.”\nThe Justice Department in September filed a suit against American Airlines and JetBlue over the carriers' plans to consolidate operations at Boston Logan International Airport, Newark Liberty International Airport, New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport and New York's LaGuardia Airport. The case still is pending.\n“In an industry where just four airlines control more than 80% of domestic air travel, American Airlines’ ‘alliance’ with JetBlue is, in fact, an unprecedented maneuver to further consolidate the industry,\" Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement. \"It would result in higher fares, fewer choices, and lower quality service if allowed to continue. The complaint...demonstrates the Justice Department’s commitment to ensuring economic opportunity and fairness by protecting consumers and competition.”\nJoining the federal suit are attorneys general from Arizona, California, the District of Columbia, Florida, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania and Virginia."

    "title": "Lawmakers, families, advocates challenge handling of COVID in federal prisons",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  Michael Carvajal seemed optimistic as he highlighted the steps the Federal Bureau of Prisons has taken to protect inmates during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n“The bureau was one of the first agencies to offer COVID testing and vaccinations.…Approximately 80% of our staff and 70% of our inmates have been fully vaccinated and we continue to increase those rates,” Carvajal, the director of the Federal Bureau of Prisons, told a Feb. 3 House Judiciary Committee hearing.\n“The bureau has transferred more than 37,000 inmates to community custody, after review of medically vulnerable inmates based on assessments,” he added.\nBut lawmakers and other critics insist that federal prison inmates were less protected from COVID-19 than the general public, more died than has been made public, and incarcerated people remain exposed to greater health risks than the prisons bureau will acknowledge.\n“Thereve been at least 300 people who have died while in the custody of the Federal Bureau of Prisons,” Corene Kendrick, deputy director of the ACLU National Prison Project, told Capital News Service. “Incarcerated people, generally, are three times more likely to die of COVID-19 than people in the general population.”\nAccording to the prison bureau’s COVID website, 4,672 federal inmates and 1,990 BOP staff have confirmed positive test results for the virus nationwide. The website said 285 inmates and seven staff members have died from COVID so far.\nOf the 285 inmate deaths, 11 occurred while on home confinement, according to the bureau. The inmate totals listed do not include inmates participating in the Federal Location Monitoring program, inmates supervised under the United States Probation Office, or those being held in privately-managed prisons or state facilities or jails.\nRep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas, asked Carvajal during the congressional hearing what to do about preventing deaths in federal prisons.\n“We have been in lockstep with the CDC from day one,” Carvajal said. “That is why we appreciate the ability under the CARES Act to transfer people out. We were able to lower our population. We are following CDC guidance. We do everything in collaboration with them.”\nWhile data on the medical isolation rate, facility vaccination rate, and community transmission rate are all available on the prison bureau’s website, advocates, including Kendrick and Joshua Manson, a researcher with the UCLA Law COVID Behind Bars Data Project, argue that most of the information on how many people have been infected with, or died of, the virus is inaccurate.\n“Theyre not being fully transparent,” Manson told Capital News Service. “Theyre sort of just asking the public to trust them when theyve really given the public no reason to trust them. There have been enormous numbers of people whove been infected in the Bureau of Prisons custodybut we know that the actual number is considerably higher than that.”\nWhen asked about criticisms of its data and policies, a prison bureau spokesperson referred CNS to the agency’s website.\nCarvajal, a Trump administration appointee, announced his resignation in January. He is staying on until he is replaced.\nSenate Majority Whip Dick Durbin, D-Illinois, has been a vocal critic of Carvajal’s tenure.\n“For years, the Bureau of Prisons has been plagued by corruption, chronic understaffing, and mismanagement,” the senator said in January.  “In the nearly two years since Director Carvajal was handpicked by then-Attorney General Bill Barr, he has failed to address the mounting crises in our nation’s federal prison system, including failing to fully implement the landmark First Step Act. His resignation is an opportunity for new, reform-minded leadership at the Bureau of Prisons.”\nIn April 2021, Durbin noted that “at times, the infection rate for the federal prison population has been nearly six times higher than in the community at large. At that time, he said, 230 inmates had died of COVID  “nearly all of whom had preexisting conditions that made them particularly and obviously vulnerable.”\n“Several were within months of being released,” Durbin said. “And 55 died after their request for compassionate release was denied or while their request was pending.”\nDurbin and Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, have introduced legislation aimed at ensuring that the most vulnerable inmates, particularly older prisoners, can be eligible for compassionate release or moved to home confinement to complete their sentences.\n“In the middle of a pandemic the federal government ought to be doing everything it can to protect the inmates in its care,” Grassley said.\nBoth Manson and Kendrick spotlighted what they said were inconsistencies in cumulative COVID-19 case numbers in the prison bureau’s records.\n“One of the things that they do is the cumulative counts of COVID-19 infections sometimes goes down…BOP officials finally admitted that what they were doing was as people were getting discharged from BOP custody, they would then remove that person from the total count of infected people,” Kendrick said.\nAdditionally, Manson urged caution on trusting the prison bureau’s numbers on vaccinated individuals inside correctional facilities.\nManson said the bureau’s website has a category for “fully vaccinated” inmates, but that website does note that the numbers reported dont include the number of people who have been given a booster.”\n“Now, I dont really think that you can call someone fully inoculated right now if they havent received the booster,” he said.\nThe prisons bureau also is not doing enough to ensure that its own employees are properly masked and vaccinated, according to critics and inmates’ family members.\nPrison bureau employees who are unvaccinated or not fully vaccinated are required to comply with CDC and agency guidance, including, according to the agency, “wearing masks regardless of the transmission rate in a given area, physical distancing, regular testing and adhering to applicable travel restrictions.”\nThe UCLA Law COVID Behind Bars Data Project also noted a dramatic uptick in the presence of COVID infections in December and January with the Omicron surge. For the first time, more than 10,000 active COVID cases were reported in January among the 150,000 inmates in the prison bureau’s 120 facilities, the project said.\nThe UCLA project also gives the Federal Bureau of Prisons an “F” for its data collection methods.\nNeela, who asked that her last name not be used in order to protect the identity of her husband, who is incarcerated at the Federal Correctional Institution El Reno in Oklahoma, told CNS prison guards were one of the reasons the virus spread and returned in that facility.\n“I dont think theyre doing their part as far as the guards are concerned, because we dont have contact visits right now, its all through like a plexiglass,” she said. “The only way these people are getting COVID is through guards.”\n“And Ive gotten in there and Ive seen a guard could care less about COVID,” Neela said. “I dont know how many guards are coming into work and have COVID. But I know every time I go, theyre not wearing their masks. Is that the reason? I dont know. But, I dont think thats helping the situation.”\nKendrick said advocates have also been pushing for less overcrowding and better hygiene practices. She said cleanliness is not often given priority inside federal facilities.\n“Youre having them sit in cells for two to four days at a time and then allowing them 20 minutes to call their loved ones, take a shower, and get on the email, do whatever, and of course the priority for these guys is talking to their loved ones because theyre concerned,” Neela said.\n“So now youre cutting their time to clean themselves, and then youre not giving them the necessary tools to do that,” she said. “I mean, how do you expect people not to get sick if youre not giving them soap or hand sanitizer?”\nVaccine education has also been put on the back burner inside prisons, according to Neela. She revealed that people jailed at El Reno were encouraged to take vaccinations by offering an optimistic picture of what the facility would look like after the majority of the population was vaccinated.\n“They were kind of bribing the inmates, they werent really educating them on why. They just told them, ‘if we can get a facility to 98%, then we can go back to everything being open, not having constant lockdown’ and things of that nature,” she said. “I do have friends that have loved ones at other facilities, and Ive heard the opposite. So I do think it depends on the facility, whos running the facility.”\nThe Prison Policy Initiative has been one of the organizations pushing for more vaccine education inside federal prisons, such as bringing in family members and community leaders.\n“If you consider that incarcerated people have a long history of insufficient medical treatment, and even medical neglect and abuse at the hands of the very same people who are not trying to vaccinate them, you can understand why its important to bring in people…to help convince them to take the vaccine,” said Wanda Bertram, a communications strategist for the Prison Policy Initiative.\nBertram also suggested that compassionate release and home confinement during the pandemic will help slow the spread of COVID-19.\n“A woman wrote in to our website yesterday and told us that her husband was supposed to be released to home confinement, and checked off the boxes that the (prison bureau) had laid out for people to be released to home confinement,” Bertram said. “But, he was not actually released under that program, and he got sent to a halfway house and the halfway house is full of COVID.”\nThe Justice Department in December gave the Federal Bureau of Prisons the discretion to allow formerly incarcerated individuals to remain in home confinement even as the pandemic eases.\nThe action reverses a Trump administration policy that directed the bureau to return those who were allowed to remain in home confinement to correctional facilities if they still had time to serve."

    "title": "With short blood supplies, Red Cross partners with LGBTQ+ groups to research potential new sources",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  America needs more blood.\nBlood supplies, which typically run at about a five-day stock on hospital shelves, have been reduced to less than a one-day supply of certain blood types, according to Ashley Henyan, communications director for the American Red Cross. That is also the case in the national capital region. \nBlood already has a limited 42-day shelf life, and blood platelets last only five days. Regular donors would have to roll up their sleeves once every 56 days to give the Red Cross the reserve it is more accustomed to.\nThe shortages come as the Red Cross, in a study funded by the Food and Drug Administration, examines the viability of changing existing donation rules to permit gay and bisexual men to donate blood without a long waiting period after their last sexual contacts with other men. \nThe blood shortage and looming expiration dates of the blood available on the shelves also pose additional difficulties to a medical system already experiencing severe challenges during the COVID pandemic.  \nBlood donations usually see a decrease in the summer months, throughout the holiday season and during the winter months. Outside of these time periods, donations typically increase. \n“Were just not seeing it bounce back,” Henyan told Capital News Service. “So because it stayed at this low point for so many months in a row now, thats whats making it a crisis.” \nHenyan also pointed out that blood “cannot be manufactured, it cannot be produced, and it cannot be stockpiled,” factors that make a steady supply of donors absolutely critical to resolving the shortage. She also cited that there is currently “less than a one-day” supply for Maryland and the District of Columbia. \n“It’s kind of leading to this perfect storm where were unable to collect as much, but you need more,” said Kate Fry, CEO of America’s Blood Centers, an organization that works alongside the Red Cross and helps distribute donated blood to regions where it needs to be. \nFry also works to counteract misinformation about blood donation during the pandemic. “If youre vaccinated or unvaccinated, you can still donate blood,” she said. \nDespite the blood shortages, the FDA still has policies in place barring men from donating blood until three months after their most recent sexual encounter with other men. \nThis three-month period replaced a 12-month period in the spring of 2020, an attempt by the FDA to allow more flexibility in blood donations during a shortage. However, the changed guidance isn’t sufficient to solve the shortage problem, or include sexually-active gay and bisexual men in more frequent blood donations, according to Henyan. \n“I think its unfortunate how many gay and bisexual men feel excluded, not just are excluded, but actually feel excluded from donating blood,” said Christian Morris, a recruitment specialist with the Whitman-Walker Institute, a Washington-based LGBTQ research, policy and advocacy organization founded in 1973 as an HIV clinic.\nMorris has recruited almost 300 participants with the Whitman-Walker Institute for what is being called “the Assessing Donor Variability and New Concepts in Eligibility,” or ADVANCE, study. \nThe study “hopes to provide evidence to repeal the current policy that discriminates against the participation of gay and bisexual men in donating blood,” according to Morris. Instead, the donation policy could be changed to rely on a case-by-case risk assessment for each potential donor. \nJosh Sorbe, a 24-year-old participant from Washington, found out about the ADVANCE study through Twitter and decided to donate blood at the Washington location because it was a way to give back during Pride Month in October. \nSorbe told CNS the whole process took three weeks and included a health history questionnaire and donating four vials of blood. He said he hopes that the study will modernize FDA guidance on donating blood.\n“A lot of data is rooted potentially in homophobia from the 20th century and this groundbreaking study really allows us to bring the discussion about blood eligibility donation requirements into 2022,” Sorbe said.\nWhile the ADVANCE study is still ongoing, Morris said he is “confident” that the FDA policy on gay and bisexual men donating blood will be updated within the next couple of years. \nFor Sorbe, updated guidance would be deeply satisfying. \n“The queer community…is willing to step up when people need help, and the fact that some of the most likely givers are still ruled out from archaic eligibility requirements is absurd to me,” he said. “So, Im really hoping this allows us to have the conversation (of) who can donate blood. Its super easy, its not hard to do and its one of the best things you can do that can change someones life.”"

    "title": "Lawmakers grill Metro over its handling of defective rail cars",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  Maryland Rep. Jamie Raskin on Wednesday questioned why Metro officials concealed for four years mechanical issues with new-model subway cars, warning that the transit system was risking the public’s faith in its safety.\nSafety is obviously a central issue for ridership,” Raskin said at a hearing of the House Oversight and Reform Committee’s government operations subcommittee. “People want it to be beautiful, people want it to be on time, but people are not going to ride it if it’s not safe.”\nWashington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority Inspector General Geoffrey Cherrington said that safety issues with the Kawasaki 7000 series cars were treated by Metro as a warranty issue.\nRaskin, D-Kensington, challenged Metro’s focus on the manufacturer rather than on its riders.\nWASHINGTON  Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Kensington, questions Metro officials Wednesday about their handling of safety issues with new-model rail cars. (Livestream screenshot by Emily Hahn/Capital News Service)\n“That’s like if I’ve got an oven that’s not working and is a fire danger for the house and I just report it to the oven manufacturer,” Raskin said. “I start writing them and I don’t tell anybody in the house that the oven is a danger to life and limb, right?”\nSafety concerns for the Kawasaki 7000-series rail cars went back to 2017, according to National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigators and Washington Metrorail Safety Commission (WMSC) CEO David Mayer.\nWheel failures on 7000-series rail cars led to the October 2021 Blue Line derailment, Cherrington said. The wheels had moved two inches and one of the car’s wheels came off the rail during the incident.\nInspectors found that the wheels were farther apart than they should have been and could have led to a “catastrophic incident,” according to a preliminary report by the NTSB.\nAll 7000-series trains were pulled out of service after the accident and then sidelined again in December after some cars failed to meet inspection requirements.\nCherrington said his office had found “no evidence, so far, that WMATA intentionally withheld information from WMSC regarding the loose wheel conditions affecting 7000-series rail cars.”\nAfter more than six years on the job, Metro General Manager and CEO Paul Wiedefeld is retiring in June.\nHouse Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Mechanicsville, said that once WMATA selects a new general manager, that person will need to work in cooperation with the safety commission to “restore the public’s faith in Metro.”\nThe Washington region’s public transit network saw an infusion of $2.4 billion in emergency aid during the coronavirus pandemic, a sum that “allowed the system to close its operating deficit for three consecutive years,” Rep. Gerald Connolly, D-Virginia, said.\nBut Metro is projecting a deficit of $519 million in fiscal 2024.\nDavid Ditch, a policy analyst at the Heritage Foundation, a Washington-based conservative think tank, decried what he called a “culture of mediocrity” at WMATA.\nHe said that “there is no guarantee that ridership will ever again reach 2019 levels, let alone 2010 levels,” and accused the agency of “endlessly throwing good money after bad.”\n“When you’re in a hole, stop digging,” Ditch said.\nRep. Katie Porter, D-California, pressed Wiedefeld to discuss what actions have been taken to hold Kawasaki accountable for the problems with the 7000-series cars.\nThe Metro CEO said he could not comment because the issue is part of the current investigation by the NTSB and the inspectors general of Metro and the U.S. Department of Transportation.\nPorter also asked Wiedefeld whether the 7000-series rail cars are indeed defective.\n“At this time we, again, we have to wait until this investigation is completed and we will determine…,” Wiedefeld began.\nPorter interrupted: “Mr. Wiedefeld, I want to be clear, you dont have to wait until the investigations clear. You may be choosing to do that.”\n“I would certainly hope you would be developing a plan,” she said. But theres no requirement that you wait, you can begin negotiations with Kawasaki in the meantime.”"

    "title": "In Maryland, Biden signs order affecting 200,000 workers in federal building contracts",
    "content": "UPPER MARLBORO, Md. — Construction workers and unions will enjoy new protections on major federally-contracted construction projects after President Joe Biden signed an executive order here Friday.\nThe order would affect an estimated 200,000 workers by requiring federal construction contracts worth over $35 million to use project labor agreements, according to the White House.\n“It will help guarantee a consistent supply of high-quality, highly-trained workers,” the president told union workers at Ironworkers Local 5 here, a suburb of the nation’s capital.\nProject labor agreements establish the terms and conditions of the employment of workers on a per-project basis. The contractor awarded the federal contract must sign the pre-negotiated PLA with the corresponding union organization.\nThen-President Barack Obama signed an executive order encouraging executive agencies to consider requiring the use of PLAs for federal construction projects worth over $25 million in 2009.\nThis new executive order makes PLA use mandatory.\nThe Biden-Harris administration says the order will make it easier for workers to settle on these agreements and will also expedite building times on major construction projects.\n“History shows us that projects under PLAs come in on time, often under budget, and put people to work in good paying jobs with benefits so that everyone wins,” Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Maryland, told Capital News Service in an interview. He attended the Biden signing ceremony, along with Sen. Ben Cardin, D-Maryland, and Rep. Anthony Brown, D-Upper Marlboro.\n“Workers built this country and will help rebuild it. It’s time we lift them up,” Brown tweeted after the presidential visit.\nVan Hollen, along with the rest of the Maryland delegation, pushed for more resources to be delivered to Maryland in the massive Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act that last year was passed by Congress and signed into law by Biden. The law is expected to funnel nearly $8 billion to Maryland infrastructure, including broadband internet, roads and bridges.\nBiden’s new order, which goes into effect immediately, targets an industry that has taken some of the largest hits since the pandemic. It also directs the Department of Labor and the Office of Management Budget to lead trainings for implementing the new requirements for the current contracting workforce.\nUnion workers also heard from Vice President Kamala Harris and Labor Secretary Martin Walsh.\n“When the United States needs something to be built right, we turn to union workers,” Harris said. “They are well-trained and well-prepared to get the big jobs done and to do them right, not to mention on time and on budget.”\nSerhan Ajaj is a 18-year veteran of Ironworkers Local 5. He started his four-year apprenticeship on March 4, 2002 — a date that is still fresh in his head because that is the day he said his life changed in the best possible way. He now enjoys good insurance, a retirement plan and competitive wages.\n“(Biden) gave me hope that they are going to continue to provide for my family the same type of life, the same quality of life I’ve been providing them,” he said.\nHis wife and three kids have also benefited from his union work. When his wife found herself in the hospital a few years ago, the Ajajs did not pay one bill out-of-pocket thanks to the union benefits.\nAjaj said he plans to continue working in Ironworker Local 5 for another 12 years until his retirement.\nThe ironworkers fashioned a steel “46” for Biden, but the president said the welcome gift was so heavy he didn’t think he could take it back to the White House.\nIn his remarks before signing the order, Biden took note of some ironworkers sitting above him. He recalled that while running for president, he visited a construction site where he saw a group of ironworkers having lunch on a beam 12 stories above the ground.\n“You’re nuts,” the president joked. “Thank God you are. You gotta not only have some brains but you have to be coordinated to be an ironworker.”"

    "title": "Washington team owner battles with new allegations, and lawmakers debate whether Congress has oversight role",
    "content": "WASHINGTON – After years of anguish and trauma, Tiffani A. Johnston said she finally had summoned the courage to speak out.\nSitting in front of the House Oversight and Reform Committee on Thursday, Johnston, a former employee of the now-Washington Commanders football team, recounted a dinner she said she once had with team owner Daniel Snyder.\nAt that dinner, Johnston alleged, Snyder placed his hand on her thigh without consent. She removed it.  Fearful of losing her job if she made a scene, Johnston said she couldn’t call out the powerful owner in front of her co-workers.\nAfter dinner, Snyder placed his hand on her lower back as he tried to push her into a limo, Johnston told lawmakers. She said Snyder’s lawyer intervened and stated that the incident was “a bad idea,” which allowed Johnston to slip away.\nCommittee Chairwoman Carolyn Maloney, D-New York, read a letter from Jason Friedman, a former executive for the Washington team, that corroborated Johnston’s limousine account.\nBut Snyder issued a statement denying Johnston’s allegations.\n“While past conduct at the team was unacceptable, the allegations leveled against me personally in today’s roundtable – many of which are well over 13 years old – are outright lies,” Snyder said.\nThe account of the dinner represented a new allegation against Snyder and one of many “lessons” Johnston said she learned in her time with the team as a cheerleader and a marketing manager.\nShe told the panel that she received many other inappropriate comments while on the job and in meetings, including a reference to a pearl necklace, a sexual innuendo unfamiliar to her at the time.\nJohnston added that she was encouraged to wear revealing clothing while making important sales pitches to suite-holders and was told to take part in inappropriate stunts.\nThe National Football League last July fined the team $10 million after a review of the franchise’s workplace culture.\nIn a statement at that time, Commissioner Roger Goodell “concluded that for many years the workplace environment at the Washington Football Team, both generally and particularly for women, was highly unprofessional,” the NFL said.\n“Bullying and intimidation frequently took place and many described the culture as one of fear, and numerous female employees reported having experienced sexual harassment and a general lack of respect in the workplace,” according to the NFL.\nAs for Johnston’s allegations Thursday, Snyder said in his statement: “I unequivocally deny having participated in any such conduct, at any time and with respect to any person.”\n“Tanya (Snyder) and I will not be distracted by those with a contrary agenda from continuing with the positive personnel and cultural changes that have been made at the team over the past 18 months, and those that we continue to make both on and off the field,” Snyder said.\nJohnston and five other former Washington employees’ testimony came a day after the team rebranded as the Commanders. But it appears the new coat of paint on the sports franchise won’t come close to washing away alleged misconduct.\n“It is going to take more than a name change to fix the broken culture,” Maloney said.\nThe panel’s roundtable sparked controversy among Democrats and Republicans as to whether the allegations against the Commanders, formerly known as the Redskins and until the rebranding The Washington Football Team, are a committee issue — or if they should be addressed in a court of law.\n“…Democrats on this committee continue to ignore these and other crises that are impacting Americans’ everyday lives,” said Rep. James Comer of Kentucky, the top Republican on the oversight committee. “Democrats instead are holding a roundtable about the work culture in one single private organization.”\nBut Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, D-Illinois, chairman of the oversight panel’s economic and consumer policy subcommittee, said that Congress does play a role.\n“The NFL holds itself to a higher standard, yet it repeatedly shirked its responsibility to keep workers safe,” he said. “It is up to Congress to get to the bottom of why.”\nDemocrats said they empathized with the victims of the alleged sexual misconduct.\n“I have a 22-year-old and an 18-year-old daughter. My 22-year-old daughter is embarking on the very career path now that you young women described at the outset of your careers,” Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Florida, told the witnesses. “And you put fear in my heart, for her and my younger daughter.”\nRep. Kweisi Mfume, D-Baltimore, was not in attendance at the hearing because it conflicted with his responsibilities as vice-chair of the Small Business Committee.\n“The roundtable was important as it adds another perspective to the controversy,” Mfume said in a statement. “I am fully supportive of whatever direction Chairwoman Maloney chooses to pursue next.”\nKrishnamoorthi said he hoped his colleagues could find common ground. But he also signaled that the Democratic majority wants to delve deeper into the work culture at Washington’s NFL franchise.\n“Today is the beginning, not the end,” Krishnamoorthi said."

    "title": "Asked about late mail, postmaster general will give late response",
    "content": "WASHINGTON – Maryland’s congressional delegation awaits a response from a letter it sent on Nov. 22 to embattled Postmaster General Louis DeJoy about the United States Postal Service’s preparations to deliver mail on time during the holiday season.\nThe delegation’s letter, which was signed by all of its members, requested DeJoys response to a list of questions by Dec. 1. So his answers are late already.\nCongressional critics for months have been pressing for DeJoy’s removal  and it could come soon.\nSome of the questions the delegation asked DeJoy are about how he is implementing the Postal Service’s Office of Inspector General’s recommendations to improve mail delivery services.\nSenator Chris Van Hollen, D-Maryland, told Capital News Service the delegation was told to expect a response soon.\n“But clearly the lack of response is part of the larger problem, and what weve seen is a pattern of conduct by the post office that doesnt get things done on time,” he said. \nThe Baltimore region had the nation’s second highest missing mail inquiries compared to other major metropolitan areas from October 2019 through June 2021, according to a Nov. 4, 2021, OIG audit report.\n“After last year’s problems, our constituents are understandably concerned about package delays this holiday season,” the lawmakers wrote in the letter. \n“Last year, for a variety of reasons, we were overwhelmed and were not able to meet the demands of the nation,” DeJoy said during a Postal Service Board of Governors meeting on Nov. 10. “ We are ready…so send us your packages and your mail — and we will deliver timely.”\nRecent OIG service performance data shows 89% of packages were delivered on time in the Baltimore District from July to September of this year.\n“There continue to be significant service problems in Maryland,” the lawmakers said, “but this is a welcome improvement from the poor service our constituents received last holiday season.”\n“That said, the OIG’s report on Baltimore revealed several problems that could contribute to a recurrence of delays this holiday season,” they continued, citing the fact that 42% of sampled packages were improperly scanned.\nHouse Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Mechanicsville, told CNS in an email that “timely mail delivery is critical for more than just holiday goods – it allows Marylanders to receive their medication, Social Security checks, and other vital items.” \nThe delegation asked DeJoy to provide a progress report on the number of additional package sorting machines deployed, seasonal employees hired for the holiday season and annex facilities activated for peak-season surges.\nMaryland’s delegation also asked DeJoy what has been done to implement some of the OIG’s recommendations, including developing and implementing a plan to comply with package scanning and handling procedures, opening a new city carrier training academy for the Baltimore region and establishing criteria for the Baltimore postmaster to ask for outside area help for mail deliveries.\nMany Democrats are displeased with DeJoy’s performance and want him out. An appointee of President Donald Trump, DeJoy has angered lawmakers for slowing mails, cutting overtime hours and other steps viewed by critics as efforts to undermine the Postal Service.  \n“I give him an F grade — failing,”  Van Hollen said. “I have long called for DeJoy to be removed as postmaster general, and I hope that the newly constituted Board of Governors will act to do that in the coming months, if not weeks.” \nPresident Joe Biden announced his intent on Nov. 19 to nominate Daniel Tangherlini and Derek Kan to the Postal Service Board of Governors to replace Ron Bloom and John Barger.   \n“We are hopeful that, if and when the President’s new nominees to the Board of Governors are confirmed, we will have the votes necessary to remove Postmaster General DeJoy from the job,” Jaime Lennon, spokesperson for Rep. C.A. “Dutch” Ruppersberger, D-Timonium, told CNS  in an email. “It is long past time to hold DeJoy accountable for the gross deterioration of service that has occurred under his watch.”\nRuppersberger wrote to Lora McLucas, the USPS Maryland district manager, on Monday to follow up on the implementation status of the recommendations in the OIG’s report. \n“While I am encouraged that your office agreed with the findings and set a target implementation date of November 30th for the recommendations in the report,” Ruppersberger said, “I continue to hear from constituents who are experiencing mail delivery issues at an overwhelming rate.”"

    "title": "Temporary legal protections leave uncertainty for Afghan evacuees resettling in the U.S.",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  Thousands of Afghan evacuees have resettled into the United States, but the temporary nature of their legal status could hinder their adjustment to the country now and in the coming years, experts say.\nThe U.S. withdrawal of troops and the Taliban’s takeover in Afghanistan forced hundreds of thousands of Afghan people to flee their country in August.\nThousands of Afghan evacuees initially came to military bases in the United States, where they received screenings, security clearances, vaccinations and health care. \nAnd thousands of other Afghan evacuees — many of them hoping to eventually resettle in the United States — were also relocated to American military bases around the world. \nSome still eagerly wait to leave Afghanistan.\nThe stopgap government spending bill signed by President Joe Biden last week included $7 billion for four federal agencies to help in relocating Afghan refugees. \nMany Afghan evacuee families who initially arrived to military bases in the United States are just now being relocated to resettlement agencies across the country, according to Stephen Carattini, president and CEO of Catholic Charities of the Diocese of Arlington. \nThe Arlington diocese has helped resettle hundreds of Afghan evacuees and anticipates hundreds more in the coming weeks, providing services including workforce preparation, mental health counseling, free medical clinics and legal immigration consultations. \nThe majority of Afghan evacuees arrive here under humanitarian parole status, which only entitles them to two years of temporary legal protection, a situation that can hinder their housing and work opportunities. \n“These individuals — we do not want (them) to go home; we want them to stay; they’re political refugees, essentially, who helped us in our foreign policy fights, yet the legal status doesnt allow them to plan the future with any type of certainty,” said Stewart Verdery, who served under President George W. Bush as assistant secretary for border and transportation security policy and planning at the Department of Homeland Security.  \n“We have other people who come to the United States (who) are designed to be temporary workers, or theyre visiting temporarily, and theyre supposed to go home; this is not the case here,” said Verdery, who is also a member of the Council on National Security and Immigration and the CEO and founder of Monument Advocacy, a bipartisan consulting firm.  \nAn “Afghan Adjustment Act” could provide a more long-term solution for Afghan evacuees in a state of limbo because of the temporary nature of their humanitarian parole status, according to Verdery.\n“Its a pretty simple legal change; it just basically provides them a place in line for a green card that currently they dont have as being admitted on parole, which doesnt provide you any legal status,” he said. \nAnd some organizations, such as the International Refugee Assistance Project, are advocating for Congress to take action that would provide a more long-term solution to Afghan evacuees’ uncertain legal status. \n“Weve been pushing for an act of Congress that would provide that kind of blanket adjustment of status for folks who came in as part of the evacuation and were paroled into the United States, to have their status adjusted so that they have a long-term durable status,” said Elizabeth Foydel, private sponsorship program director for the International Refugee Assistance Project. \nThe nonprofit, based in New York City, provides legal aid for refugees and other forcibly displaced people around the world and pushes for immigration policy changes at the federal level. \n“But the challenges havent ended since the formal U.S. withdrawal concluded,” Foydel said, who also emphasized the legal challenges for those still living in Afghanistan. \n“So, over the past couple of months since, there (have) beenclients and family members in Afghanistan for whom were trying to think through long-term solutions, and.we still have a significant amount of advocacy around evacuation, as well as whats happening to the folks who are evacuated once they evacuated,” Foydel said. \nThe temporary legal protections for Afghan evacuees can also create additional barriers toward securing affordable housing. \n“What’s unusual in our case is thatbecause of the lack of affordable housing in the areaonly people with primary ties can ask to be resettled in Northern Virginia,” Carattini said. The region has a significant Afghan community. \n“If (Afghan evacuees) do not have a primary tie in the United States, then they are assigned to resettlement agencies in parts of the country where there is more available housing and employment,” Carattini said. \nSarah Sheffer, senior communications adviser for Welcome.US, said finding affordable housing has been a challenge for the Afghan evacuees they have assisted. \nWelcome.US is a broad coalition that began in September to support the resettlement of Afghan evacuees in the United States. \n“We are welcoming tens of thousands of newcomers into our communities at a point when our resettlement infrastructurehas been substantially diminished,” Sheffer said. \n“And we are facing things all Americans are facing, like a shortage of affordable housing, and we know thats being coupled with the difficulty of renting to families who have no credit history coming into the United States, so housing has been a really critical challenge to getting people off bases and into homes that are suitable and safe,” Sheffer said. \nBut local resettlement agencies are looking for ways to tackle affordable housing issues for Afghan evacuees. \nThe Maryland-based Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service has partnered with the rental company Airbnb. The organization also educates landlords to better understand the Afghan evacuees who are adjusting to life in a completely new environment. \nSince Afghan evacuees arrived, many have had to endure separation from their family and friends who remain in Afghanistan. \nThe evacuees chaotically rushed out of Afghanistan without any time for proper goodbyes.   \n“Weve seen many husbands and wives where the husband is here, but the wife is still in Kabul or the other way around, or grandparentstheres a lot of concern for family members (who) are left behind, whether or not and when they will see them again, so it was not an orderly departure,” Carattini said. \n“It was not (as if) everyone had time to get their affairs in order, say their goodbyes and even the idea that ‘hey, well come back and visit you kind of thing’ — none of that happened,” he said.\nAnd some evacuees in the United States with family members left behind in Afghanistan might be worried about their loved ones facing retribution from the Taliban, according to Krish O’Mara Vignarajah, president and CEO of the Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service.\nThe organization has resettled nearly 200 Afghan humanitarian parolees and 60 Afghan Special Immigrant Visa holders since the initial evacuation and expects to resettle roughly 2,500 more parolees in Maryland.\n“I think one concern is just making sure that we can help — not just provide a roof over (evacuees’) heads and food in their fridges — but also trauma-informed care that recognizes the psychological and emotional kind of turmoil that theyve been through,” Vignarajah said.\nThousands more Afghan evacuees at U.S. military bases abroad are expected to arrive in the United States in the coming months, in addition to those still living in Afghanistan. \n“Its never easy to be a refugee; it’s never easy to be displaced (and) find yourself in a new place,” Carattini said. “And then to have done this through COVID — its really, really hard."

    "title": "Historic Amtrak funding aims to alleviate delays and replace nearly 50-year-old rail cars",
    "content": "WASHINGTON – Emma Campbell, a technician at the National Museum of Heath and Medicine in Silver Spring, Maryland, has been riding Amtrak trains at least twice a year since attending college in 2012. \nHalf of the Amtrak trains she has taken have been delayed anywhere from 15 minutes to four hours, she told Capital News Service.\n“I have a love-hate relationship with Amtrak because I love what they could be, but I don’t love what they are,” Campbell said. \nAmtrak hopes to change those negative experiences with a historic influx of $66 billion in funding through President Joe Biden’s $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill. The funding will go towards reducing maintenance backlogs, improving tracks and signals, replacing nearly 50-year-old railcars and replacing or overhauling old tunnels and bridges in a massive effort to modernize the nation’s passenger railroad service. \nThe bill will provide $6 billion in directed grants over five years to projects along the Northeast Corridor, a 457-mile-long route connecting major cities from Washington through Baltimore to Philadelphia, New York and Boston. The corridor is Amtrak’s busiest, serving 6.1 million passengers in fiscal year 2020, which is a decrease of nearly 50% in ridership from Amtrak’s pre-COVID fiscal year 2019 reports. \nThe delayed replacement of century-old infrastructure has been a burden on Amtrak employees, Amtrak CEO Bill Flynn said in testimony last May before the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee’s subcommittee on railroads, pipelines, and hazardous materials. \n“But the Amtrak and commuter train passengers who use the Northeast Corridor every day also pay the cost, as they endure the unreliability that comes with depending on infrastructure never meant for today’s demands,” Flynn said. \n\nThe largest cause of delays for Amtrak passenger trains is freight train interference  when passenger trains on tracks owned by freight railroads, known as host railroads, are delayed by slower freight trains ahead of them, according to Amtrak. \n“The greatest threat to the future of our long distance network is not COVID-19, but rather poor on-time performance that diminishes the value of these services to our customers and ossified routes that cannot be changed or expanded because of host railroad resistance,” Flynn said in October testimony before the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee. \nFederal law requires passenger trains be given priority over freight trains. However, the Department of Justice has enforced that law just once and that was 40 years ago, according to Amtrak. \n“They claim passenger rail in America has the right of way and it’s a lie,” Campbell said. “You wouldn’t believe how many times I’ve been told ‘the train cannot move because there’s freight ahead of us.’”\nInterference by freight trains has accounted for about 60 percent of Amtrak’s delays systemwide in recent years. Those delays are a major factor in Amtrak’s operating losses, according to a 2019 report by Amtrak’s Office of Inspector General. In fiscal 2018, the passenger railroad lost $171 million. \n(Amtrak said it was close to erasing its losses by fiscal 2020, but the COVID-19 pandemic nearly erased ridership for a time, resulting in an operating loss of $801 million.)  \nHowever, freight interference is nowhere near the leading cause of delays in the Northeast Corridor, because Amtrak owns the tracks in that region. But that constitutes most of the 3% of track Amtrak owns across the 21,400 route-miles its trains use, according to Amtrak’s Host Railroad 2020 report card. \nPassenger-related delays such as delays related to disabled passengers, wheelchair lifts, large groups, etc., were the chief cause of the 880 delays on the Northeast Corridor that Amtrak was responsible for in fiscal year 2021 third quarter. And, of the 873 host railroad responsible delays, only 39 were caused by freight train interference.\n\nMost of the remaining tracks throughout the country are owned by freight rail companies such as CSX, which make all the train dispatching decisions, including what trains have priority over others. The Capitol Limited route from Washington to Pittsburgh is the only route located in Maryland that is owned by CSX.\nSystemwide, according to the Amtrak report card, “freight trains caused 700,000 minutes of delay to Amtrak passengers in 2020 – that’s equivalent to more than a year of passengers waiting for freight to go first.” \nThe only other two sections of the Northeast Corridor that are not owned by either CSX or Amtrak are the 46-miles between New Rochelle, N.Y., and New Haven, Conn., owned by Connecticut Department of Transportation and 38 miles between the Massachusetts-Rhode Island border and Boston, which is owned by Massachusetts but operated and maintained by Amtrak, which shares the track with commuter rail service.\nTo alleviate delays, Amtrak could add more tracks to minimize conflict with freights, said Dr. George List, a civil engineering professor at North Carolina State University. \n“For Amtrak to implement and offer new services such as adding tracks, the company will have to negotiate with the freight railroads to make provision for those services to be offered,” List said. \nMost of the railroads in the United States have a limited amount of track capacity and the railroads do not tend to over-invest in that, List said. \n“In that sense if the passenger trains and the freight trains are trying to use those facilities at the same time, it’s a somewhat intricate scheduling problem to figure out how to weave the passenger trains into the movements of the freight trains,” List said. “If there is interest in having the faster services, either provided or increased by investments, more capacity is probably something that needs to happen.”\nThe boost of funding allocated to the Northeast Corridor will help Maryland, but the state has not been in discussions with CSX about adding track, said Peter Wendolkowski, acting chair of Rail Passengers Maryland, a local affiliate of the national Rail Passengers Association, which is focused on public transportation issues. \n“No matter where the funds are coming from, challenges are always faced when it comes to the freight railroads, whether it’s for freight train interference, access to the tracks, or money for certain improvements,” Wendolkowski said. \nAccording to House testimony from Edward Hamberger, president and CEO of the Association of American Railroads, “expanding passenger rail operations over the nation’s freight rail network involves significant opportunities and challenges.”\n“The odds that these challenges can be overcome will be higher if certain principles are followed,” he said. In his prepared testimony, Hamberger said: “Passenger rail use of freight rail corridors should not compromise freight railroads’ ability to serve present or future customers.”\nIn April, Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Illinois, Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Connecticut, and Rep. Donald Payne, Jr., D-New Jersey, introduced legislation aimed at improving Amtrak’s on-time performance. The lawmakers’ bill, called the Rail Passenger Fairness Act, would authorize Amtrak to file suit against freight rail companies that do not comply with the law giving passenger trains priority. \n“With the Rail Passenger Fairness Act, we can finally hold freight railroads accountable when they fail to follow the law and get Amtrak’s on-time performance back on track,” Durbin said in a statement.\nOne improvement Amtrak riders won’t be waiting long to see is the replacement of 45-year-old Northeast Regional Amfleet I cars with new rolling stock: 83 Intercity train sets, deployed on routes accounting for almost half of Amtrak’s annual ridership, according to the Department of Transportation. \nCampbell said she is most looking forward to Amtrak’s new cars. \n“From what I know, most of their trains are still from the 80s, which is why it doesn’t surprise me that things break down,” she said. \nOne one occasion, Campbell said she remembers being told over the trains loudspeaker that the auxiliary engine was down. Her train had stopped in the middle of nowhere and it was dark outside, she said. \n“None of us were very confident about getting to our destination,” said Campbell, who said she usually finds her Amtrak delays occur because of issues with locomotives.\nAmtrak’s new rail sets will be powered by dual-mode diesel-electric locomotives, allowing them to operate on the electrified Northeast Corridor route and then continue to destinations beyond using conventional diesel power, eliminating the need to stop for engine changes, according to Flynn.\nAmtrak spokeswoman Beth Toll told CNS that the infrastructure bill will provide federal funding to advance rail projects and initiatives in the Northeast Corridor and across the nation. \nProjects set to advance include implementing a plan to make a 15-year investment in 150 projects along the Northeast Corridor, Toll said. \nIncluded in the plan is the replacement of the Amtrak and commuter rail route through the aging Baltimore  Potomac tunnel with a four-track, two-mile long tunnel called the Frederick Douglass Tunnel, that will reduce trip times by permitting speeds up to 100 m.p.h. The old tunnel will be upgraded to permit speedier passage of freight trains from the port.\nThe location of the existing Baltimore  Potomac Tunnel serving Amtrak, MARC and freight trains on the Penn line, and an outline of the new tunnel that would serve just Amtrak and MARC trains. (Map courtesy of Amtrak)\n“The tunnel has become a major bottleneck to the port. Now, the Port of Baltimore will be getting a $125 million grant to upgrade that tunnel so freight trains can come double-stacked through that tunnel,” Biden said during his Nov. 10 visit to Baltimore. \nAccording to Wendolkowski, the Baltimore tunnel fix and Washington’s Union Station expansion will allow for increased MARC service on the Penn line, one of three service lines running between Washington, Baltimore and other Maryland stations. \n“Having Baltimore in the mix is really important for Maryland,” he said.\nPlans also call for replacing the Susquehanna River Bridge near Havre de Grace, Maryland, and constructing two new platforms at Baltimore’s Penn Station to allow Amtrak Acela service to pass slower Northeast Regional and MARC trains in both directions. \nBy 2035, improvements are projected to save $140 million annually through commuter and intercity travel time reductions as well as a 33% increase in Amtrak intercity service, according to the Northeast Corridor Commission’s plan."

    "title": "In move to electric vehicles, Maryland is doing better than most",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  The future of the American automobile industry is electric, President Joe Biden said in an August executive order, pledging to make half of all new cars and trucks sold in 2030 zero-emission vehicles. \nBiden on Wednesday put the purchasing clout of the federal government behind his push for electric vehicles, signing a new executive order to convert the 645,000-vehicle federal fleet to zero-emission cars and trucks by 2035. The latest move is part of a series of steps Biden ordered to reduce the federal government’s carbon footprint.\n“The actions and investment required to achieve these goals will protect the environment, drive innovation, spur private sector investment, improve public infrastructure, and create new economic opportunity,” Biden said in the order. \nBut weaning the nation off of gas-fueled vehicles might be easier said than done, although Maryland is doing better than most states.\nCompared to Europe’s electric vehicle sales compound annual growth rate of 60% from 2016 to 2020, as well as China’s 36% growth rate, the United States is lagging behind at just 17%, according to Pew Research Center. \nAmong the 50 states and the District of Columbia, Maryland ranks seventh in being prepared for electric vehicles, according to Zutobi, an international online driver education firm. The metric measures the number of registered electric vehicles in each state, the percentage of all registered vehicles that are electric and the number of public chargers, based on a scale of 1 to 10.\nOf the 10.2 million electric vehicles on roads around the world, China accounts for 44% of them, Europe 31% and the United States just 17%, according to the Pew study.\nMaryland had 40,587 registered electric vehicles as of the end of November, Deputy Secretary of the Maryland Department of Transportation R. Earl Lewis Jr. told Capital News Service in an interview. \nLewis, who chairs the Maryland Zero Emission Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Council, also noted that Maryland has over 1,000 electric vehicle charging stations in the state. \n“One of the challenges is the concern about range anxiety  that vehicles will be charged, there wont be enough charging stations, and people can get stranded,” Ben Grumbles, the Maryland secretary of the environment, told CNS. “So working with companies and agencies like the Maryland Department of Transportation to significantly expand more corridors for infrastructure charging is very important.”\nThe $1.2 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill, which Biden signed into law in November, includes $63 million for the expansion of Maryland’s electric vehicle charging network over five years. \n“It was one of the most important components when the debate was playing out in Congress,” Ben Grumbles told CNS. Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, a Republican, “was leading the charge with governors and members of Congress on a bipartisan basis saying this infrastructure bill is about cleaner transportation and cleaner energy.”\nConsumers considering the purchase of electric vehicles could get additional encouragement if Biden’s $2.2 trillion “Build Back Better” package of social spending and climate initiatives gets through Congress. That’s because one provision included in the bill is a tax credit for the purchase of an electric vehicle. \nThe package also includes billions of dollars to convert the federal vehicle fleet and United States Postal Service vehicles to electric power. \nThe bill narrowly passed the House last month but faces an uncertain future in the Senate.\nOn the state level, funding for charging stations has come from a number of sources, including from a vehicle manufacturer.\nVolkswagen, which sold diesel-powered vehicles equipped with illegal “defeat devices” that emitted ten to forty times above the NOx standard from 2009 to 2015, was required to give settlement funds to states impacted by its actions. According to the Maryland Department of the Environment, about 16,357 of these illegal vehicles were sold in Maryland, making the state eligible to receive nearly $76 million. \n“When the state got funding through the Volkswagen cheating scandal several years ago, we could allocate up to 15% of our entire settlement to electric vehicle charging,” Grumbles said. “And weve done exactly that. That translates into over $11 million for electric vehicle charging stations.”\nMaryland is also taking additional steps toward getting zero-emission vehicles on the road, including a public education campaign about the potential benefits of electric cars. \n“This is a choice that will make sense for them for a lot of different reasons,” Lewis said. “Some people know it has a better environmental profile and others want to make the choice because they want to save dollars and operating costs.” \nLewis pointed to high fuel prices for gas-powered cars as a primary potential cost reduction when purchasing an electric car. \nOn a national level, Maryland has made it a priority to partner with other states to meet a net-zero goal of vehicle emissions. \nMaryland joined a task force with California, Connecticut, Massachusetts, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island and Vermont, in which the states “agree to coordinate actions to support and ensure the successful implementation of our Zero-Emission Vehicle programs,” according to a memo from the group.\nAnother element of the electric car wave is a shift in production, Carole Delion, Division Chief  of Connected  Automated Transportation Systems in the State Highway Administration, told CNS. \n“The push toward electric batteries is wild,” Delion said. “So many companies are moving forward with them.”\nLewis also pointed to the fact that electric cars require far fewer parts to manufacture compared to gas-powered vehicles, making the production of more electric cars a reasonable initiative. \n“We have very aggressive goals (in Maryland),” Grumbles said about a zero-emission future. “And were glad that the federal government now has very aggressive goals. If all the stars align, it is achievable. But its going to take a lot of work.”"

    "title": "Former homeless veteran gives shelter to others who struggle",
    "content": "WASHINGTON — Michael Strong was stranded, barely staying alive on the bustling streets of metropolitan Baltimore for five years. The South Carolina native and Air Force veteran was homeless because of his addiction to cocaine and alcohol. He even feared for his own life on a few occasions.\n“It was one night, actually sleeping on the streets in a doorway, and a guy comes up, and he’s got a knife in his hand. He says, ‘Get out of my house.’ That scared me to death,” Strong remembered about the incident in 1995.\nEncountering a life-threatening situation was traumatic but not too abnormal for homeless veterans like himself.\n“After that, no more staying in doorways,” Strong told Capital News Service. “At the time, I was working at Blue Cross Blue Shield. That’s when I started using the buses and the subway. Once you got paid, you’d go get a monthly bus pass so you could just ride. As long as you have a pass, they can’t bother you.”\nAfter decades of struggle, hes no longer spending nights sleeping in the streets. Now Strong is helping homeless veterans find shelter at a place a little more than three miles south of the United States Capitol.\nFor Strong, much of his life has been a circuitous route through achievement, reverses and battles with debilitating addiction.\nWASHINGTON — Michael Strong, program manager at D.C. Vets, stands outside the Chesapeake Health and Education Program’s transitional housing center on 4034 6th St. in Southeast Washington. (Gabriel Pietrorazio/Capital News Service)\nUpon graduating from Marlboro County’s Wallace High School in 1980, Strong enlisted in the U.S. Air Force. He served as a data systems analyst, co-writing one of the first computer programs replacing key-punch cards.\nStrong traveled across the globe for eight years until leaving the service after writing a few bad checks as a noncommissioned officer. He was in debt and already had a substance abuse problem. Rather than receiving a court martial, Strong scraped by with an honorable discharge since he had a spotless record otherwise.\nWhile Strong still found success working high-profile jobs while transitioning back into civilian life, he couldn’t escape his struggle with a nearly life-long addiction, which he says began after drinking his first alcoholic beverage at the age of eight.\nWorking as a network administrator for the Baltimore City Health Department, Strong got busted for stealing company computers and flipping them to feed his drug habits. \nHe received a lenient sentence of unsupervised probation for six months and was ordered to pay restitution for all stolen equipment. But he was fired from his job. \nThree months later, on Aug. 22, 2002, he woke up one morning inside the basement of a crack house in the inner city. That’s when he decided to change his life. \nAt the age of 41, Strong entered the Maryland Center for Veterans Education and Training on High Street in Baltimore, a transitional housing program funded by the U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs. With only $3.47 to his name, he stayed there for 33 months, enduring nearly three years of detoxification and receiving intensive counseling.\nStrong’s struggles with alcoholism cost him 13 years of close contact with his ex-wife LaDonna, his son DeMarkco and daughter Sade. They were reunited shortly after his release from the facility in 2005.\n“I took my daughter and my son to school on the first day, but after that, it was a blur,” Strong recalled. “So, by the time I got back in my kids’ lives, my daughter was 16, and my son was 18.”\nJames Mett, a former sharpshooter during the Vietnam War, was also a junkie, but quickly became Strong’s mentor. He helped (me) find a positive path forward. To this day, Strong still believes the best approach in any counselor’s book is simply meeting clients where they are — maybe even sharing a story or two about the counselor’s own struggle. \n“The truth is, my counselor told me his story, and that motivated me,” Strong said. “It was the drugs and the alcohol and along with crime; it all came together prior to homelessness.”\nStrong has been sober for nearly 18 years. He is now the program manager at the Chesapeake Health Education Program’s D.C. Vets, a transitional housing center along Sixth Street in Southeast Washington.\nEstablished in 1990, the Chesapeake Health Education Program is a nonprofit based in Perryville, Maryland. The organization says it believes in “communities helping and empowering patriots,” bringing about financial, mental and emotional stability by maintaining transitional housing centers. In addition to its Washington facility, the program operates facilities in Perry Point, Maryland, and Charleston, South Carolina.\nSince its opening in 2012, D.C. Vets has helped 181 veterans, 168 of whom were successfully discharged from their traditional housing program. Most of those served were people of color.\nBut even with all of the resources and services at their disposal, some veterans still slipped through the cracks and couldn’t secure any permanent housing arrangements, Strong said. \n“Veteran homelessness is just a microcosm of the society at large,” he added.\nDecades after his days in the Air Force, Strong now serves as the center’s acting program operations director, case manager and marketer. A man of many hats, he still wears his navy blue Air Force veteran baseball cap with pride.\nIn 2013, Strong self-published a memoir: Strong Getting Stronger: An Inspiration. \n“Going inside meant I had a problem, and it’s not easy to admit you’ve got a problem,” Strong wrote. “I finally mustered the courage to go inside, which, as it turns out, was only half the battle.”\nWhenever he meets fellow veterans, Strong insisted, no one ever believes he used to be a homeless cocaine addict.\n“They didn’t see the guy that was lying in the dope house or the guy who had to sleep on the streets, had to stay on the subway all night long or take the longest bus run in Baltimore City so that he could stay warm,” Strong said.\nHe hopes his story motivates his fellow veterans, brothers and sisters bound by blood and service to their country. Veteran homelessness persists, despite government efforts to address it.\nAs of January 2020, about 300 veterans were struggling with homelessness in the District of Columbia on any given day, according to a report sent to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. The report also said that there were as many as 464 homeless veterans in Maryland and 395 in the neighboring state of Virginia. \nIts not always obvious who the veterans are among the broader, declining populations of homeless people in Maryland, Virginia and the District of Columbia, Strong said.\n“When people see homelessness, they dont really know what they’re seeing,” he said. “Nobody thought I was homeless.”"

    "title": "Supreme Court weighs Mississippi abortion law, future of Roe v. Wade",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  With a crowd of hundreds of activists gathered outside, the Supreme Court heard arguments Wednesday on a Mississippi law restricting abortions that challenges the nearly 50-year precedent set by Roe v. Wade. \nThe justices signaled that they were aware of the highly-charged political nature of the case. Many of their questions centered on how their decision could impact American society. \nAssociate Justice Sonia Sotomayor suggested the very legitimacy of the high court was at stake if it overturned its landmark ruling in 1973 that made access to abortions legal. She noted that sponsors of the Mississippi law said they proposed the abortion restrictions because there were new justices on the Supreme Court.  \nWill this institution survive the stench that this creates in the public perception  that the Constitution and its reading are just political acts?” she said. “I don’t see how it is possible.”\nThe 2018 Mississippi law bans abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy. The law is not currently in effect as the state awaits the court’s decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization. \nMississippi Solicitor General Scott Stewart argued the precedents set in Roe v. Wade and a later case, Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey, should be overturned and that the court should allow states to decide their own laws.\nWhen Roe was decided in 1973, the court established a person’s right to abortion up to the point of viability, which is typically regarded as 24 weeks of pregnancy. In 1992, justices in the Casey case established the “undue burden” standard to determine the validity of state abortion restrictions.\nStewart argued that the “undue burden” test was difficult to apply and said that the justices should, “return the choice to the people.” \n“Many people vocally really just wanted to have the matter returned to them so that they could decide it locally, deal with it the way they thought best and at least have a fighting chance to have their view prevail, which was not given to them under Roe and then, as a result, under Casey,” Stewart said. \nThat step would not outlaw abortion nationwide, he explained, as many states would still choose to keep abortion legal. \nBut Julie Rikelman, attorney for the Center for Reproductive Rights, argued that the justices should affirm two lower court rulings that Mississippi’s “Gestational Age Act” at issue is unconstitutional.   \n“Two generations of women have now relied on this right,”she said. “There is no less need today than 30 years ago or 50 years ago for women to make this decision for themselves.” \nRikelman said the ban would restrict a pregnant person’s liberty and bodily autonomy, which is protected by the 14th Amendment. She also said people rely on the precedents set in Roe and Casey that protect access to abortion. \nRikelman argued overturning the precedents would result in “forced pregnancies” and disproportionately impact women of color and other marginalized communities.\nAssociate Justice Elena Kagan said those advocating for the Mississippi law needed to show “a strong justification in a case like this beyond the fact that you think the case is wrong.” \n“And I guess what strikes me when I look at this case is that, you know, not much has changed since Roe and Casey, that people think its right or wrong based on the things that they have always thought it was right and wrong for,” Kagan said.\nElizabeth Prelogar, U.S. Solicitor General, arguing on behalf of the Biden administration, said “the real world effects of overruling Roe and Casey would be severe and swift.”\nAssociate Justice Samuel Alito asked Prelogar, “Is it your argument that a case can never be overruled simply because it was egregiously wrong?” \n“I think that at the very least, the state would have to come forward with some kind of materially changed circumstance or some kind of materially new argument,” Prelogar said. “And Mississippi hasn’t done so in this case.” \nThe Jackson Women’s Health case comes before a new Supreme Court with a 6-3 conservative majority. The justices questions seem to suggest that alterations to current abortion rights are imminent, though whether they will fully overturn precedent remains to be seen. \nAssociate Justice Stephen Breyer said he was concerned about the public’s perception of the high court as it wrestles with one of the most contentious issues in American life. \nBreyer said the functioning of the court as an institution “comes primarily from people believing that we do our job. We use reason. We dont look to just whats popular.” \n“The problem with a super case like this, the rare case, the watershed case, where people are really opposed on both sides and they really fight each other, is theyre going to be ready to say, ‘no, youre just political, youre just politicians,’” Breyer said “And thats what kills us as an American institution.”\nAssociate Justice Brett Kavanaugh listed several cases in which the court went against set precedent, leading to the expansion of rights, such as the overturning of the “separate but equal” segregation standard in schools in Brown v. Board of Education.\n Kavanaugh asked Rikelman “if we think that the prior precedents are seriously wrong  why then doesnt the history of this courts practice with respect to those cases tell us that the right answer is actually a return to the position of neutrality  and not stick with those precedents in the same way that all those other cases didnt?”\nChief Justice John Roberts, a potential swing vote in the abortion decision, appeared to be looking for a way to preserve the Mississippi statute without overturning Roe.\n“If you think that the issue is one of choice, that women should have a choice to terminate their pregnancy, that supposes that there is a point at which theyve had the fair choice, opportunity to choice, and why would 15 weeks be an inappropriate line?” Roberts asked. “Because viability, it seems to me, doesnt have anything to do with choice. But, if it really is an issue about choice, why is 15 weeks not enough time?”\nAfter the arguments ended, Rep. Cori Bush, D-Missouri, joined pro-choice advocates on the court’s steps, warning that the conservative majority of the Supreme Court may deal a blow to reproductive rights.\n“Justice is what this building is supposed to represent. Notice I said ‘supposed’ to represent, but the history of this court has not always lived up to that,” Bush said. “Today, we are here to say there is nothing just about a far-right Supreme Court determined to oppress us.” \nJ.C. Carpenter, a leader and sidewalk counsel with Christian-based pro-life organization 40 Days For Life, drove from her hometown of Marysville, California to support the pro-life demonstrators in front of the court. \n“I think there is an amazing pro-life turnout,” Carpenter told Capital News Service. “I think the pro-aborts are well outnumbered and I hope that that speaks to what’s going to happen with this case.” \nAt least 26 states are poised to ban or restrict abortion if the justices uphold the Mississippi law and overturn Roe, according to abortion research and policy organization The Guttmacher Institute. \nThe court’s ruling is not expected until next year."

    "title": "Supreme Court to hear arguments over Mississippi law banning abortions after 15 weeks",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  In a landmark case watched by abortion advocates and opponents, the Supreme Court will hear oral arguments Dec. 1 on a 2018 Mississippi law challenging nearly 50 years of legal access to abortions. \nThe case, Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, considers the constitutionality of Mississippi’s ban on most abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy. \nThe ban is not currently in effect as the state awaits the high court’s decision, which is not likely until next year.\nA ruling in favor of Mississippi would overturn the precedent set in Roe v. Wade, a 1973 Supreme Court decision that effectively legalized a woman’s right to choose to have an abortion.\nJackson Women’s Health has been the only abortion clinic in Mississippi for over a decade, according to Hillary Schneller, senior staff attorney at the Center for Reproductive Rights and co-lead counsel in the upcoming Supreme Court case.  \nIn 1992, there were eight facilities providing abortions in the state, but by 2014, only two remained, according to the American Civil Liberites Union. \nSchneller told Capital News Service that abortion restrictions in Mississippi have been increasing since the 1990s, putting more of a burden on patients and providers. \n“In addition to there being only one clinic, patients have to make two in-person trips, separated by at least 24 hours, (and) receive state-mandated counseling,” she said. “All of the clinic’s providers fly in from out of state, which really restricts the number of days the clinic can make abortion services available.” \nThe state has also placed restrictions on common practices for abortion care, including the use of telemedicine visits to assist with the taking of prescribed drugs to produce an abortion. \n“And all of these restrictions are falling on folks for whom its already really challenging to make ends meet and, in particular, for communities of color, who are disproportionately poor,” Schneller said. “So all of those things combine and make it incredibly difficult for someone to even reach this one clinic in the state.” \nMississippi is also unique in that it is the only state requiring abortion providers to also be OB-GYNs, the ACLU reported.\nAnti-abortion advocates see the Mississippi case as their best chance to reverse almost five decades of what they view as government-supported murder.    \n“I am committed to making Mississippi the safest place in America for an unborn child, and this bill will help us achieve this goal,” tweeted former Mississippi Republican Gov. Phil Bryant, who signed the Gestational Age Act into law in 2018.\nA range of groups submitted briefs in support of Jackson Women’s Health and the protection of abortion rights in Mississippi and across the nation. \nAmong those was one from a group of medical associations that included the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Medical Association. \nThe medical groups argued that abortion “is a safe, common, and essential component of healthcare” and that “scientific evidence conclusively demonstrates that a fetus is not viable at fifteen weeks.” \nIn 1996, the precedent set in Roe v. Wade was challenged in the Supreme Court case Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey. The court upheld the right to abortion access in that case, but imposed what is known as the “undue burden standard,” by which a state could not impose an “undue burden” on a pregnant person seeking an abortion. \nFurthermore, the case determined viability as the point when a state’s interest in protecting the life of a fetus can override a person’s right to an abortion.\nMedical groups supporting Jackson Women’s Health explained that once a fetus becomes viable, “medical support alone could sustain it, and its continued existence is no longer entirely dependent on the pregnant patient.” \nBut the groups assert that at 15 weeks, a fetus is still two months before viability and the focus on “fetal pain” in the Mississippi law is a distraction and scientifically unfounded. \n“There is no credible scientific evidence of fetal pain perception pre-viability, and certainly none at fifteen weeks,” the brief reads. “Every major medical organization that has examined the issue of fetal pain and peer-reviewed studies on the matter have consistently reached the conclusion that pre-viability abortion does not result in fetal pain perception.”\nMultiple groups also submitted briefs supporting the Mississippi law. \nThe Roman Catholic Dioceses of Biloxi and Jackson in Mississippi used the claim of “fetal pain” in defense of the law.\n“Should Lady Justice turn a blind eye to the cry of the unborn child, sucking its thumb, hidden in the sacred dark refuge of his or her mother’s womb, only to have that womb become a tomb?” the dioceses wrote. “Justice should not abandon the unborn child.”\nTwo dozen states, including Texas, Alabama and Florida, also submitted a joint brief in support of the Mississippi law.\n“The case against abortion as a constitutional right is not difficult to make,” the 24 states argued. “It is simply not present in the Constitution or protected throughout the Nation’s history. Those who seek to justify the continued preservation of the right have the greater hurdle  and one that must ultimately prove insurmountable.”\nMembers of Congress on both sides of the aisle submitted briefs as well: 236 members joined a brief in support of the Mississippi clinic, while 228 wrote a brief advocating for the new state law. \nSeparately, Sens. Josh Hawley, R-Missouri, Mike Lee, R-Utah, and Ted Cruz, R-Texas, wrote a joint brief in favor of upholding the law. \nReproductive rights advocates say if the law is upheld, the impact would be felt nationwide. \n“Youre looking at a future where around 21 states will no longer have abortion access,” Laurie Bertram Roberts, co-founder of the Mississippi Reproductive Freedom Fund, told CNS. “Obviously, people can get pills off the internet, and they will continue to do so. But thats not gonna solve the problem of people not being able to get to the clinic. Its not solving the problem of people not being able to get to clinics now.” \nThe answer, Bertram Roberts says, lies in pushing lawmakers to affirm and protect abortion access. \n“We need to be asking our lawmakers what they (are) going to be doing to make sure that happens,” Bertram Roberts said. “Because for a very long time, its been an optional thing for one side of the political spectrum and not the other, and thats why were here.”"

    "title": "The Congressional Black Caucus: Building a legacy for half a century",
    "content": "WASHINGTON — William Lacy Clay Jr. remembers being 12-years-old and standing beside his father launching his campaign bid one day after the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in the spring of 1968.\nIt was a historic race for the House: William Lacy Clay Sr. became Missouri’s first Black representative elected to Congress, in part because of redistricting that gave him a seat containing the state’s largest concentration of Black voters.\nShortly after the monumental victory, the congressman-elect and his family — his wife, Carol, Clay Jr. and daughters Vicki and Michelle — moved to Washington. \nClay Jr. attended Montgomery County public schools in Silver Spring, Maryland, later enrolling at the University of Maryland, College Park. He took a full-time job where his father, the new congressman, worked.\n“My assignment was a doorman in the U.S. House of Representatives, which allowed me to see my dad working Capitol Hill up close, and learning the legislative process,” Clay Jr. told Capital News Service.\nIn 1971, Clay Sr. joined 12 other Black House members to create the Congressional Black Caucus, six years after the Voting Rights Act of 1965 passed.\nThe caucus is celebrating its 50th anniversary and remains in the forefront of struggles over civil rights and voting rights. In this Congress, the caucus, now grown to 57 members, has been battling to enact legislation intended to counter voter suppression efforts championed by Republicans in Congress and state legislatures.\n\nThe Congressional Black Caucus played an instrumental role in propelling the final passage of President Joe Biden’s bipartisan infrastructure bill, a $1.2 trillion spending package that will funnel federal dollars to bridges, highways, airports, water projects and expanded broadband services, among other projects.\n“We believed that most members would want to go back home and say what they delivered,” Caucus Chair Joyce Beatty, D-Ohio, said on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” on Nov. 8.\nWith six caucus members serving as chairs of committees, the group also has influenced the shaping of the so-called Build Back Better bill, a nearly $2 trillion investment in social programs Biden also is pressing Congress to pass. The measure passed the House on Friday.\n“It’s transformational… We have had our fingerprints and footprints are all over this legislation,” Beatty said.\nSince its founding, the caucus has had relationships with every president — some better than others. As for Donald Trump, there essentially was no relationship. He never officially met with the entire caucus, partly because he “demonstrated significant disrespect for the caucus,” House Majority Whip James Clyburn, D-South Carolina, said.\nWASHINGTON — Democratic Majority Whip James E. Clyburn, D-South Carolina, sits inside his congressional office at the Cannon House Office Building during a Zoom call with Capital News Service. He has been a caucus member since 1993. (Gabriel Pietrorazio/Capital News Service)\n“I don’t know any better member to ever serve in the Congress as more lionized than John Lewis, but the former president insulted him in a way that is almost unbelievable,” Clyburn told CNS.\nLewis, a Democrat who represented Georgia’s 5th District and was a civil rights icon, died last year. Asked about Lewis, Trump said in an interview with Axios on HBO that the Georgian “chose not to come to my inauguration,” later saying “nobody has done more for Black Americans than I have.”\nLike father, like son\nWilliam Lacy Clay Sr. was at the heart of the civil rights movement as an alderman in St. Louis, Missouri. He became a supporter of the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) and was jailed for 112 days during the 1963 Jefferson Bank demonstrations, a series of civil protests aimed at addressing racial discrimination in workplaces.\nTwenty years later, Clay Sr. and his caucus colleagues led the movement to make King’s birthday a federally-recognized holiday.\nClay is known for coining the phrase “just permanent interests,” his son said, “and it is the model for the Congressional Black Caucus. In politics, Black people have no permanent friends, no permanent enemies, just permanent interests.”\n In 1992, Clay Sr. authored Just Permanent Interests: Black Americans in Congress 1870-1991. The book is “treated like the Bible of Black politics,” his son said.\nAfter graduating from college, Clay Jr. got accepted into the Howard University School of Law, but was only there about a month before politics beckoned.\nNathaniel J. “Nat” Rivers, a member of Missouri’s state Legislature and close friend of Clay Jr.’s father, was resigning in 1983. Then 27, Clay Jr. entered a special election and won. He served for 17 years in both houses of the state legislature.\nClay Sr. announced his retirement in 2000, opening up an opportunity for his son to run and ultimately succeed him after fending off a competitive bid for Missouri’s 1st Congressional District.\nThe younger Clay was sworn in with the rest of the 107th Congress in 2001. Carol W. Clay, his daughter, stood to one side, while his father, Clay Sr., stood on the other.\n“It was a recreation of what I did in January of 1969, when my dad was first sworn in,” Clay Jr. remembered.\nHe said his new job wasn’t a drastic adjustment.\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nClay Jr. already knew many of the Black lawmakers from his younger days serving as a doorkeeper: Georgia’s Lewis, Reps. Charles Rangel, D-New York, Ronald Vernie Dellums, D-California, and Louis Stokes, D-Ohio, a former neighbor in Silver Spring whose lawn he used to cut.\n“My job description was to know all 435 members of Congress by name and state and to inform them on what the votes were, and for me to come back 17 years later, as a member, it was just the thrill of my life,” Clay Jr. explained.\nHe also made new friends among fresh faces in the caucus, too.\nClay Jr. said he and then-Sen. Barack Obama, a junior Democrat from Illinois, “quickly became close friends and worked on legislation together.” Clay and Obama spearheaded legislation to fund the construction of the Stan Musial Veterans Memorial Bridge, which connects St. Louis, Missouri, to St. Clair County, Illinois.\nNeither Clay nor his father believed they would ever witness the election of a Black president during their lifetimes. But in 2009, Clay Jr. was on the inauguration platform on the West Front of the United States Capitol watching his friend Obama take the oath of office as president.\nThe seemingly impossible happened once again in 2020, when a CBC alumna, Sen. Kamala Harris, D-California, battled her way to the vice presidency, breaking racial and gender barriers in the process.\n“It’s amazing the progress that has been made through the CBC over fifty years,” Clay Jr. added.\nAfter serving two decades, he lost his seat in a contentious primary in 2020 against Cori Bush, a nurse and Black Lives Matter activist.\nStill permanent interests: 50 years later \nHarris acknowledged her ties to the caucus while speaking at the 10th anniversary of the MLK Memorial alongside President Joe Biden in late October.\n“Chairwoman Joyce Beatty and my — I will call you, still, my colleagues at the Congressional Black Caucus. Thank you all for your leadership,” Harris said at the podium while standing in front of the towering 30-foot tall white granite statue. \nRep. Barbara Lee, D-California, remembers serving as the chairwoman of the caucus during Obama’s presidency, a time when the memorial was just constructed. Lee told CNS the caucus still plays a crucial role in “fighting constantly for justice, not only for African Americans, but for the entire country.”\n“Fifty years later, we’re championing many of the issues that we were championing back then,” Lee added.\nWASHINGTON — Rep. Barbara Lee, D-California, a CBC caucus member since 1998, stands on steps of the U.S. Capitol. (Gabriel Pietrorazio/Capital News Service)\nThe legacy built in part by Clay’s father is being expanded by the 57 Black caucus members serving in the House and Senate. They represent 27 states as well as the Virgin Islands and the District of Columbia. Sens. Cory Booker, D-New Jersey, and Raphael Warnock, D-Georgia, are only two of a total of 11 Black senators who have served since 1870.\n\nBlack representation in Congress had a brief flowering after the Civil War. In 1870, Hiram Revels, a Republican from Mississippi, became the first Black senator in U.S. history. The election the same year of Rep. Joseph Rainey, R-South Carolina, the first Black member to serve in the House, also gave hope for Black communities that sought to become a part of the political process.\nOther Black lawmakers followed in their footsteps, but by the start of the 20th century, a resurgence of white racism and racial violence — buttressed by segregation, voter suppression and Jim Crow laws in the South — extinguished Black ambitions for a role in national political life.\n“The people who founded the new caucus reminded me that no matter how long I stayed in Congress, or how many stories were written, I owe it to myself to talk about the original African American members of the Congress, who by 1901, had completely disappeared as a result of Jim Crow, and redistricting and gerrymandering,” Rep. Kweisi Mfume, D-Baltimore, told CNS.\nFifty years ago, the original 13 founding Black caucus members made up only two percent of the Congress. Today, the caucus is 10 percent of the Congress.\nMarc Morial, president and CEO of the National Urban League, said the caucus has evolved “where it’s a far more diverse body, because its members represent mixed districts.” \n“Some represent dominantly white districts, some represent predominantly Black districts,” Morial, former mayor of New Orleans, told CNS.\nNot only is the CBC a representation of “Black America on Capitol Hill,” Morial said, it also serves as “the conscience of Congress.”\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nParren Mitchell was Maryland’s first Black House member, representing the 7th District from 1971 until 1987.\nMfume was first elected to Congress from Maryland’s 7th District in 1986, succeeding Mitchell in the same district. He served until 1996, when he left to become president and CEO of the NAACP. \nRep. Elijah Cummings, D-Baltimore, succeeded Mfume. Cummings died in office in 2019. Mfume won a special election in May 2020 to return to the House, again representing the 7th District.\nIn Maryland’s 4th District, Democrat Albert Wynn served from 1993 until 2008. Democrat Donna Edwards succeeded him, serving until 2017.\nRep. Anthony Brown, D-Upper Marlboro, succeeded Edwards, and is now running for Maryland attorney general.\nMitchell, Mfume and Cummings all served at different times as chairmen of the CBC — the most chairmen to come from the same House district.\n\n\n“I can simply say that caucus, and the opportunity that you get to represent issues and people beyond where you are elected from is significant, and it’s humbling,” Mfume said.\nThe caucus chairmanship also means wielding power — the ability to focus some attention in Washington toward the interests of Black constituents — a responsibility Mfume said he carried very seriously.\n“​​It was an opportunity to put together a plan that would move the agenda forward,” the veteran Baltimore lawmaker said. “For me, it meant having 40 votes in your back pocket on any given day.”\nBill Clinton. Rosa Parks. Nelson Mandela. Mfume met many prominent public figures during his tenure as chairman. During the Clinton administration, Mfume recalled, he pressed caucus members not to sign off on any initiatives unless they “fell in line” with their expectations.\n“That was the most rewarding aspect of my term as caucus chair, to be able to parlay votes in a way that had not been done before,” Mfume added. “But in a way now, that is sort of kind of second nature to how we operate.”\nStill facing challenges\nBut even with 55 votes in the House, the power of the Black caucus alone has limits: the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, a bill that passed the House in 2020 and again in March, has stalled because of Senate Republican opposition.\n“It’s heartbreaking for families across this country, who wanted to believe that their Congress would in fact find a way to deal with this issue of police, excessive use of force,” Mfume said. “The Senate had no stomach for it and eventually found a way to walk away from it.”\nMuch like the police accountability legislation, the Senate doesn’t have a stomach for addressing threats to voting rights either, advocates like Morial say.\nBrown believes passing legislation like the Freedom to Vote Act and John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act are possible ways of addressing “one of the most fundamental issues” the nation faces.\n“Without the right to vote and the unencumbered access to the ballot, then everything that we fight for becomes that much more difficult,” Brown told CNS.\nWASHINGTON — Rep. Anthony Brown, D-Upper Marlboro, has been a member of the Congressional Black Caucus since 2017. (Gabriel Pietrorazio/Capital News Service)\n“We shoulder a responsibility to not only champion the aspirations, the dreams, the goals and the pursuits of the Black community, and frankly, the Black diaspora,” he added. “Our work goes beyond domestic policy… to protect and defend the interests and the rights that continue to be under assault and attacked in this country, even today, in 2021.” \nReparations for slavery is an integral part of that conversation for the caucus. \nMfume remembers cosponsoring a reparations bill by former Rep. John Conyers Jr., D-Michigan. The measure was introduced consecutively for a decade and Mfume said it’s frustrating to return to Congress without any progress on that front.\nRep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas, now is sponsoring House Resolution 40, a bill aimed to establish a commission to determine possible paths forward for slavery reparations.\n“If you’re going to get real reparations on behalf of the Afro-American community, there has to be a federal commitment.” Brown added. “It’s difficult for that to happen without first having a commission.”\nClyburn, another former CBC caucus chair who now serves as the Democratic majority whip, says the agenda shifts from time to time, depending on which issue “ought to be at the front of the line.”\n“There are times when I think things like HBCUs (Historically Black Colleges and Universities) should be at the front of the line. Other times, I think that closing the wealth gap should be at the front and closing the healthcare gap. These gaps are all there… we know they’re there,” Clyburn told CNS. “It all depends on whats taking place in the Congress and the country as to how we ought to be prioritizing.”\nEven though Rep. Eleanor Holmes Norton, D-District of Columbia, is one of the most senior members from the caucus, sharing that title with Rep. Maxine Waters, D-California, she said she still feels largely left out of the legislative process.\n“Even when I came, we’re under-represented,” Norton said in an interview with CNS. “The Congressional Black Caucus took the role of Congress, men and women at large, recognizing that many African Americans were in districts where they had no hope of representation and somebody needed to speak for them.” \nThat was especially true for the District of Columbia, an underserved constituency, even to this today.\n“We need all the help we can get,” she added. “I think the most important issue facing the Congressional Black Caucus is statehood for the District of Columbia.”\nWASHINGTON — Rep. Eleanor Holmes Norton, D-District of Columbia, stands inside her congressional office at the Rayburn House Office Building. (Gabriel Pietrorazio/Capital News Service)\nFor Norton, having full voting powers representing the new “State of Washington, Douglass Commonwealth,” as House-passed bills would rename the District, could be crucial in a narrow House Democratic majority like the one now.\nBut prospects for getting statehood for the District through the current Senate, divided evenly between Republicans and Democrats, are very poor.  \n“I have all of the powers of any other member of the House except that final vote in the House of Representatives,” Norton said. “Now when we control the House by only three votes, you can see how that would matter.”"

    "title": "Marylanders say they are feeling the pinch of inflation",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  Some Marylanders say they are changing their budgets as they pay more for basic necessities like groceries and gas due to inflation.\n“My husband keeps saying as the prices keep going up he’s not going to be able to retire,” Donna Rhodes, a 62-year-old retiree from Owings, told Capital News Service as she put groceries into a car. “You would like prices to go down instead of the prices going up.”\nThe Consumer Price Index, which is a common measure of inflation, climbed 6.2% in October compared to last year  the largest yearly increase in more than 30 years, the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Nov. 10.\nThe index rose 0.9% last month following a 0.4% increase in September, the report said. Elevated prices in October were wide-ranging, with prices rising in energy, shelter, food, used cars and trucks as well as new vehicles. \nOne factor driving inflation, which is the rate at which prices increase over time, is too much government spending, said Dr. Antonio Saravia, an associate professor of economics at Mercer University, citing in part the stimulus checks that were issued to millions of Americans during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n“Now you have all of this spending, all of this money in the economy, and people are using that to go purchase things, he said. “And as we go to the stores and purchase things, prices go up.”\nAnother reason inflation is rising is because the Federal Reserve, the countrys central banking system, printed too much money so people could continue to make purchases during the pandemic, Saravia said. \nDr. Erica Groshen, senior economics advisor at Cornell Universitys School of Industrial and Labor Relations and former commissioner of the BLS, noted contributing factors to rising prices include some prices returning to normal from prices that were lower during the pandemic. Prices also have been pushed up by supply chain disruptions, she said. \nThose delays have “meant increases in prices for things that have been slow to arrive at our ports to get to our stores,” Groshen said. \nSaravia said supply chain disruptions wouldn’t have changed prices so much if the Federal Reserve and government did not print and spend so much money.\nFood prices increased 0.9% last month, according to the CPI, and supermarket customers are noticing the higher prices. \n“Everything is like double the price, and its very difficult,” said Juanita Sherman, a 53-year-old Upper Marlboro resident and Metro employee. “Ive been shopping for the last two weeks for Thanksgiving over pay periods so I can get everything.”\n\nGas prices are rising too, according to the CPI, increasing 6.1% last month, which is the fifth consecutive monthly increase.\nJustin Hawkins from Chesapeake Beach owns a landscaping company. The 31-year-old said he increased the cost of his services because gas prices rose. \n“So its been an impact to (businesses) like mine because thats what I rely on,” he said. “The mowers take gas, any trimmers or anything like that  all that stuff takes gas. So I feel like the business I’m in, its definitely been impacted being that I rely on fuel.”\nHow inflation impacts average consumers depends on what they buy, Groshen said. When inflation is higher, consumers either have to save less or spend more than they planned. \nFor Kate Palermo, 38, who goes grocery shopping at least once a week, she plans more about what she’s going to buy from the grocery store because of its higher prices. \n“I was never much of a meal prepper, the stay-at-home mom and Dunkirk resident said. “When we lived in Washington, I would daily walk to the market there, and I would see what Id want to cook that night. But now…its easier and more sufficient to kind of prepare for the week.”\nKeith Chapman, 69, of Upper Marlboro, said rising gas prices have caused him to cut back on visiting his grandkids and going out.\n“It’s ridiculous now,” the retiree said. “(Everything’s) going up except your paycheck.”\nPrince Georges County resident Shahid Allah said he doesn’t do as much long-distance driving anymore because of higher gas prices. (Brittany N. Gaddy/Capital News Service)\nGroshen thinks the rise in prices is likely temporary, explaining that slowing bond purchases, which the Federal Reserve earlier announced, and increasing interest rates will help cool off inflation. \n“Now we dont know exactly how long temporary is,” she added.\nSaravia said he doesn’t think inflation will slow down for at least the next two years because he doesn’t see the Federal Reserve raising interest rates any time soon or slowing the printing of money. He also said he doesn’t see the government slowing its spending.\n“Ive been waiting, thinking this is gonna subside,” said Torey Milton, a 26-year old Millersville resident who works at the Naval Academy in Annapolis, talking about rising gas prices.\n“Normally as soon as the fall hits the prices kind of fluctuate, but I thought things would have kind of gone back to normal now,” he said. “So I will have to adjust my budget now.”"

    "title": "Never mind the honeybee: Maryland researchers want more buzz over saving native bee species",
    "content": "WASHINGTON – Although honeybees have captured national attention in an effort to “save the bees,” some Maryland entomologists want to shift the focus toward native bee species that are in graver danger. \nBees are the most important pollinators on Earth, critical to populating native plants and fundamental to ensuring the abundance and variety of agricultural crops. \nMisguided information on which bee species to save has created a media frenzy over protecting the honeybee despite research pointing to steady honeybee populations, experts say. \n“The honeybee is not the bee we need to save because its not endangered,” said Dr. Nathalie Steinhauer, science coordinator for the Bee Informed Partnership Inc. and a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Maryland’s Department of Entomology. Honeybees are an important species, if only because of their contribution to the pollination of many agricultural crops, and they are facing many issues affecting their health. Despite those, beekeepers have so far managed to keep their numbers relatively steady. They are therefore not endangered.' \nThe honeybee is native to Europe, Africa and Asia. Early colonists brought these insects to the United States, where they now dominate research and general understanding of bees. \nBeekeepers have managed to keep the overall number of honeybee colonies in North America stable over the last two decades, according to the Bee Informed Partnership, a coalition of researchers and labs established to improve the health and survival of honeybee colonies. \nCollected in Cumberland, Maryland, leaf cutting bees are an invasive species usually found in industrial wastelands. (Courtesy of Heagan Ahmed/U.S. Geological Surveys Native Bee Inventory and Monitoring Lab)\nTo be sure, pesticides, stress and diseases still hinder the health of honeybees nationwide. \nBut some native bee species, such as the rusty patched bumblebee, are truly endangered and often compete with honeybees to pollinate natural environments. \nPart of the reason honeybees get so much attention stems from constant societal reinforcement of their importance. \n“Culturally, other bees don’t exist,” said Sam Droege, wildlife biologist for the U.S. Geological Survey’s Eastern Ecological Science Center in Laurel, Maryland. \n“That’s why we don’t know anything about (native bee species), and then when someone puts out a media report, a lot of it’s really short,” he said. \nThe Eastern Ecological Science Center houses the Native Bee Inventory and Monitoring Lab, which develops tools and surveys to identify native bee species. \nRoughly 4,000 native bee species reside in North America and approximately 430 of those species inhabit Maryland, including at least 80 kinds of ground-dwelling mining bees, 20 species of leaf cutting bees, 10 types of bumblebees, plus carpenter bees, mason bees (they make mud nests) and squash bees (which live in the ground near pumpkins or squash plants). \nBut researching native bee species can be a daunting task, according to Jennifer Selfridge, the invertebrate ecologist for the Wildlife Heritage Program of the Maryland Department of Natural Resources. \nMany native bee species are tiny and solitary, and bee sampling is a relatively new development in entomology.\nThe mason bee, which makes mud nests, is vital to fruit tree pollination. (Courtesy of Laura Campbell/U.S. Geological Surveys Native Bee Inventory and Monitoring Lab)\n“The desire is to want to lump them into one big study so you can understand them all, but theyre very different,” Selfridge said. \nSelfridge said the Native Bee Inventory and Monitoring Lab’s location in Maryland has led to more data and research on native bee species compared to other states. \nEven so, research on Maryland’s native bee species lags behind research on other insects and invertebrates due to the limited funding and lack of long-term datasets.\n“The funding that we have available to us is generally more geared toward rare, threatened and endangered things, so things that are really in trouble,” Selfridge said. \nDroege said researchers often have to make crude inferences about native bee species in Maryland. \n“‘You can’t find them anymore’ is not a great, very nuanced survey program,” Droege said.\n“That’s where we are. But worse is, things that are not bumblebees are so tiny, so obscure, we don’t even know if they were there to begin with because we are describing entirely new species that weren’t described before,” he said. \nEfforts to “save the bees” grew out of human actions, including urbanization that destroys natural insect habitats, including harming bee populations. \n“I really want to emphasize: we do know that nature is changing,” Droege said. “You dont put houses on the ground and have positive benefits to nature.” \nMaryland plays a role in endangering native bee species as urbanization also decreases flower populations, which bees need for pollination and survival. \n“And the fact that we’re losing landscape to urbanization is something that’s going to actually increase the impacts of climate change,” Steinhauer said. \nDroege said increasing the diversity and number of flowers on Maryland’s landscape could help native bee species survive. \nWhile a lot of public attention is focused on the survival of honeybees (like the one here), Marylands native bee species need a closer look, scientists say. (Courtesy of Phil Frank/U.S. Geological Surveys Native Bee Inventory and Monitoring Lab)\n“The stateis a big property owner, manager and a regulator, so you have regulations that surround a lot of things that would impact the number of flowers in the area, essentially,” he said. \nAt the individual level, people can also make a positive impact on the future of bees. \nAs consumers, people can choose to support companies that make the effort to reduce the environmental impacts affecting bee populations, Steinhauer said.  \nAlthough commercial beekeeping helps with pollination and honey production, personal beekeeping can drive down the population of native bee species that compete with honeybees for pollination. \n“If youre getting into honeybees because you want to save the environment, youre not –– youre doing the opposite,” Droege said. \n“Your hives arenot saving honeybees because honeybees have disease problems and your hive is probably a disease vector, if anything,” he said. \nThe decline in populations of native bee species points to a larger biodiversity crisis facing the United States and the world, according to scientists. \n“We are losing species at a rate that is faster than weve ever recorded in history,” Steinhauer said. “Bees are not an exception.”"

    "title": "Federal lawmakers in both parties seek to redress veteran homelessness",
    "content": "WASHINGTON — While homelessness among veterans improved dramatically between 2009 and 2019, thousands remain on the streets  a tragedy lawmakers in both parties are seeking to address in proposed legislation.\nIn March, Sens. Chris Van Hollen, D-Maryland, Rob Portman, R-Ohio, Elizabeth Warren, D-Massachusetts, and Dick Durbin, D-Illinois, introduced the Improving Housing Outcomes for Veterans Act.\nThe measure is a response to a May 2020 Government Accountability Office report that, among other things, detailed insufficient coordination on housing between the Department of Veteran Affairs and local housing providers.\nVeteran homelessness dropped nearly by half between 2009 and 2019, the GAO found. But as of 2019, there still were more than 37,000 homeless veterans.\n“Advocacy groups estimate that many more veterans may be considered at risk of homelessness,” the GAO added.\nThe GAO recommended that the VA medical centers and providers develop ways to better collaborate local community services; that the VA should make clear to local providers how it measures the effectiveness of veteran housing programs, and that the Department of Labor improve its data collection.\nThe VA and Department of Labor acted upon those recommendations, according to the GAO.\n“Our bill… is designed to codify and fully implement those recommendations so that we can better serve our veterans,” Van Hollen told Capital News Service.\n“Our overall goal is to make sure that we are there for our veterans, just as they were there for our country,” he added. “And we need to do that in every area of endeavor, including making sure every veteran has a safe and secure place to call home, a place to live.”\nThe proposed legislation also would require the VA and the Department of Housing and Urban Development to improve coordination between the agencies’ homelessness programs, and would direct the VA to provide training to community groups serving homeless veterans.\nCompanion legislation has been introduced in the House by Reps. Anthony Gonzalez, R-Ohio, Kathleen Rice, D-New York, David Joyce, D-Ohio, Bill Johnson, R-Ohio, and Brian Kirkpatrick, R-Pennsylvania.\nAn April roundtable led by Sen. Jon Tester, D-Montana, later resulted in the creation of a separate bill called the Building Solutions for Veterans Experiencing Homelessness Act.\nThe proposed legislation would allocate $60 million annually to the Homeless Veterans’ Reintegration Program through the Department of Labor to help unemployed veterans get long-term jobs.\nIt would also upgrade housing facilities, and create a pilot program for substance use recovery to assist veterans who have been less than honorably discharged.\n“We’re looking at maybe putting an omnibus together at the end of the year,” Tester told CNS, referring to a catch-all spending bill that would contain a host of pending legislation. “Those bills certainly are going to be part of the equation for that omnibus, depending on if somebody wants to hold them up or not, and then we’ll also look at other avenues if that doesn’t work.”\nTester is chairman of the Senate Veteran Affairs Committee.\n“This is all circular, it’s all intertwined and homeless vets are not something this country should be proud of,” Tester said. “We need to do everything to get them into housing and get them long-term employment, and that’s really the goal here.”\nVan Hollen shares that view and is a strong supporter of the HUD-Veteran Affairs Supportive House program, better known as VASH.\nThe senator said that when he was in the House, he worked on the issue with Ike Leggett, former executive of Montgomery County and a Vietnam War veteran.\n“One of the things I’ve been very involved inis dramatically increasing the amount of VASH vouchers,” Van Hollen said. “Through getting more VASH vouchers, we were able to eliminate veteran homelessness in Montgomery County. We need to do that statewide.”\nAs a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Van Hollen assisted in allocating an additional $50 million for the HUD-VASH program. That boost would provide an estimated 4,650 new rental vouchers for veterans facing homelessness.\nThe increase is in the fiscal 2022 Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies spending bill, which hasn’t passed yet."

    "title": "At Baltimore&#8217;s port, Biden touts &#8216;once-in-a-generation&#8217; infrastructure investments",
    "content": "BALTIMORE  Against a backdrop of container ships in the Port of Baltimore, President Joe Biden on Wednesday called his just-passed $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill a “once-in-a-generation investment” that eventually will ease supply chain congestion and boost the nation’s economy.\nThe Baltimore facility, which Biden called “one of the best ports in the country,” is set to benefit from the infrastructure legislation passed by the House on Friday. The measure, which funds highways, bridges, water projects and public transportation, will be signed into law on Monday, the White House announced shortly before the president’s visit.\n“This bipartisan construction bill is a major step forward,” Biden said.\nThe infrastructure package includes $17 billion for ports around the nation, a sum that the president said “represents the biggest investment in ports in American history.”\nThe Port of Baltimore is an economic driver in Maryland, responsible for the import and export of cars as well as farm and construction equipment. Over 15,300 people work directly at the port. It generates an additional 139,000 jobs in the region.\nInvestment in ports comes as the national supply chain has been disrupted amid the COVID-19 pandemic, affecting many industries and driving up consumer prices.\nBiden’s Baltimore visit was the first of what are expected to be several presidential trips in coming weeks to tout not only the infrastructure bill but a second, larger measure that would provide $1.75 trillion in new social program spending. That second bill remains in negotiations among House and Senate Democrats.\n“Were already in the midst of historic economic recovery,” Biden told a gathering of local and port officials, accompanied by Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott, Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Maryland, and Maryland Democratic Reps. John Sarbanes, Kweisi Mfume and “Dutch” Ruppersberger.\n“And thanks to both steps were taking, very soon were gonna see the supply chain start catching up with demand,” Biden added. “So, not only will we see more record-breaking job growth, well see lower prices, faster deliveries as well. This work is going to be critical as we implement the infrastructure bill, and as we continue to build the economy from the bottom up.”\n“We need to unlock the full might and dynamism of our economy,” Biden said.\nA portion of the infrastructure bill’s port funding allocation will go toward a $2.25 billion Port Infrastructure Development and Grants program through the Department of Transportation that the Port of Baltimore can apply for.\nAbout $5 billion in additional funding will be funneled through the Army Corps of Engineers for construction projects including ports and inland waterways.\nBefore Biden took the stage, he was preceded by Hogan, a Republican, and other government officials.\nHogan said the overhaul of Baltimore’s Howard Street Tunnel to allow trains to carry double-stacked containers between the city and Philadelphia will increase production and add up to 10,000 new jobs.\n“This landmark bipartisan legislation will help us grow jobs, expand economic opportunity and enhance security,” Hogan said."

    "title": "Ahead of Veterans Day, Biden administration focuses on veteran suicides",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  Ahead of Veterans Day, the Biden Administration has directed federal agencies to take new steps aimed at reducing suicide deaths among veterans in the United States.\nVeterans make up about 7.9% of the U.S. population, but account for about 13.5% percent of suicides in the country, according to the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention.\n“Just by being a veteran, statistically, youre 1.5 times more likely to die by suicide,” Alex Silva, military and veteran outreach chair for the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention National Capital Area chapter, told Capital News Service.\nThe Biden Administration last week laid out a set of five executive priorities to address veteran suicide prevention.\nA host of federal agencies have been directed to coordinate information about limiting access to firearms and drugs among veterans and service members in crisis; enhance mental health services for those in crisis; improve ways of identifying veterans and service members considered at risk for suicide; address ways to ease the transition to civilian life, and share research data on suicides among veterans and service members.\n“Suicide among service members, veterans, and their families is a public health and national security crisis,” the White House said.\nIn 2019, 6,261 veterans died by suicide in the United States, according to the Department of Veterans Affairs. While that represented an overall decrease of 399 suicide deaths from the year-before number, the veteran suicide rate was still about double that of the civilian population.\nFrom 2001 to 2019, the population of veterans in the United States decreased by about 23%. During that same period, the rate of suicide deaths increased from 23.3 per 100,000 veterans in 2001 to 31.6 per 100,000 in 2019, according to the VA’s 2021 National Veteran Suicide Prevention Annual Report.\n!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var a in e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r=0;r\nNotably, the VA report did not show data on the suicide rate among veterans during the COVID-19 pandemic because the numbers for 2020 and 2021 were not yet available.\nResearchers and preliminary reports suggest that suicide risk has increased among the general population during the pandemic.\n“You can't have suicide without hopelessness,” Silva said. “You talk about hopelessness and access to firearms, and you talk about impulsivity, or just kind of the perfect storm of all of these circumstances, it can absolutely contribute. The thing with suicide is that we can't really point at a single cause for it, we can just kind of look at individual factors that increase somebody's risk and how much somebody has stacked on them at a certain time.”\nAccess to firearms and substance use can be risk factors for suicide and are seen more among veterans and active service members than in the civilian population, according to researchers.\nVeterans use firearms more than any other means of suicide. According to the latest VA report, firearms were used in 69.2% of veteran suicide deaths in 2019. Among the civilians, firearms were used in 47.9% of cases.\nAbout one in 10 veterans has been diagnosed with a substance abuse disorder, a slightly higher number than the general population, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse.\nAnother report from The Defense Health Agency and the RAND Corporation in 2015 also showed higher rates of binge drinking among military members and veterans than civilians.\nSilva said access to alcohol and other drugs can act as a “snooze button” sometimes for people who are struggling with their mental health, a recourse “that can make them not be in pain right now, that they can do discreetly, privately.”\nThe transition out of military life can present unique challenges for veterans.\n“That first year post-transition is a high-risk time,” said Sherman Gillums, Jr., chief strategy officer for the National Alliance on Mental Illness, “and many (veterans) don't make it into the VA, especially if they've got bad paper -- a punitive discharge or things that were related to their mental illness.”\n“And I know a lot of (veterans) that were discharged because of a mental illness, and never got the connection to the VA that they needed,” he said.\nA veteran of the Marine Corps, Gillums explained part of the reason this transition period can be so difficult is because healthcare benefits don’t start immediately.\n“When you get out of the military, unless you retire, you're no longer connected to military care,” Gillums said. “So you have to either find a job where you can then continue to have care, or you apply to the VA for care.”\n“But in order to get care at the VA,” he continued, “you have to have a rating. So you have to get a disability rating. And that process can take a long time... So (there’s) that interim period where you're kind of in no man's land… And it's not easy to figure out if you don't know the system.”\nThe Biden administration has directed several government agencies, including the Departments of Defense, Health and Human Services and Veterans Affairs, to improve access to mental health services for veterans in several ways, including reducing co-payments for mental healthcare, expanding access to telehealth services and making policy recommendations to increase military access to mental health services.\n“We need to continue fighting to reduce suicide among our nation's Veterans. The new strategy from (the White House) outlines five priorities we will focus on at (the Department of Veterans Affairs) to fix this complex, but preventable, problem,” Secretary of Veterans Affairs Denis McDonough tweeted on Nov. 2.\nAdvocates agree that awareness of the particular suicide risk among veterans has increased in recent years.\nThat is partially due to a better understanding in the public of mental health issues, Silva said.\n“If you look at a lot of older generations, things like mental health and trauma can be looked at as more of an inherent strive to be not weak,” he said. “And that can be a very, very deeply held belief.”\n“As we move forward in understanding suicide as a mental health issue, and as a health issue, it creates a lot less stigma about seeking help,” Silva said. “Being able to look at it from a medical lens, it's a lot less controversial than looking at it as a moral choice.”\nPost-traumatic stress is one area where mental health professionals have gained a lot more insight. Gillums explained such stress among many active and former military members is a “survival mechanism” and not always combat-related.\n“We're trying to destigmatize and demystify this idea of this person who went to Iraq or Afghanistan and came back, all messed up,” Gillums said. “That's not it at all. A lot of them are well-adjusted, strong individuals who just didn't get the treatment, or they didn't admit to the illness because their commanders didn't encourage that.”\nHe said having senior leaders in the military talk about their own need for mental health treatment can be helpful, particularly for younger troops. The other big key for helping struggling veterans, Gillums noted, is peer engagement.\n“There's a big emphasis on having veterans who have overcome crises to be in that army of individuals who will be there for another veteran, but it's also demystifying illness,” Gillums said. “So that we don't treat veterans, every one of them, like a ticking time bomb, by having conversations out in public about what mental illness is.”\nThe National Suicide Prevention Lifeline provides specialized services for veterans who are struggling with thoughts of suicide. If you or someone you know is struggling, call the Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255 and press 1 for veteran-specific care.

    "title": "Massive infrastructure bill cleared by House includes nearly $8 billion for Maryland",
    "content": "WASHINGTON — An unprecedented infrastructure bill that won final passage by the House late Friday includes nearly $8 billion for highway, public transportation, ports and broadband projects throughout Maryland. \nThe $1.2 trillion measure, now awaiting President Joe Biden’s signature, cleared the House on a bipartisan 228-206 vote. The bill passed the Senate on a bipartisan vote in August. \nThe massive spending legislation provides nationwide funding for critical infrastructure projects such as bridges, highway and airport construction, water pollution control, groundwater storage, broadband and public transportation, including improvements to Amtrak. \nThe infrastructure bill is the first half of Biden’s signature legislative agenda. The second part, the so-called “Build Back Better” bill, would provide nearly $2 trillion in investments in new social programs, but its final scope remains the subject of intense negotiations among moderate and progressive Democrats in the House and Senate. \nBiden is expected to visit the Port of Baltimore on Wednesday to discuss how the infrastructure bill will improve the country’s ports and strengthen supply chains across America, according to the White House.\nThe infrastructure bill will provide funding for state priorities, including another round of support to build out high-speed internet and broadband access. The legislation also is expected to generate “huge numbers” in job creation for Maryland, Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Maryland, told Capital News Service.. \n“The job estimates that I’ve seen are in the hundreds of thousands,” he added.\nAccording to a variety of sources, including the White House and House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, funds for Maryland are expected to include:\n\n$4.1 billion for federal-aid highway projects over five years\n$1.7 billion for revitalizing almost a quarter of aging public transportation vehicles, and over $150 million to the Washington Metro Transit Authority to improve safety and make repairs over eight years.\n$844 million for improving water infrastructure and ensuring clean drinking water in communities \n$238 million to continue the restoration of Chesapeake Bay over five years\n$409 million for bridge replacement and repairs over five years\n$200 million for expanding broadband coverage, including providing internet access to at least 148,000 Marylanders who currently do not have such service \n$158 million for airport infrastructure improvements development over five years. \n$63 million for supporting the expansion of an electric vehicle charging network over five years\n$15.9 million for protecting Marylanders against cyberattacks\n$7.9 million for protecting against wildfires over five years, and for preparing infrastructure for the impact of extreme weather events \n\nMaryland will also benefit from the bill’s $3.5 billion national investment in housing weatherization programs, which would cut energy costs for low income households. \nImprovements to Maryland’s infrastructure have been long overdue, supporters have said. In 2020, the American Society of Civil Engineers gave the state a C grade, based on a 12-category Infrastructure Report Card, a slight bump from the C- Maryland received in 2011. \nWith 273 bridges and over 2,201 miles of highway in poor shape, according to the White House. Maryland’s House delegation was nearly unanimous in backing the “once-in-a-generation investment,” as Biden characterized the bill Saturday after its passage.\nAll Maryland House Democrats voted in support of the bill, but Rep. Andy Harris, R-Cockeysville, the sole Republican in the delegation, opposed the measure.\n“Yesterdays infrastructure bill added hundreds of billions of dollars to the federal debt,” Harris tweeted on Saturday. “We have to stop spending our children and grandchildrens money.”\nBoth Maryland Democratic Sens. Ben Cardin and Van Hollen supported the legislation. \nThe infrastructure bill also includes an amendment to make an agency supporting the growth of minority business enterprises permanent, which was in part sponsored by Cardin, the chairman of the Senate Small Business and Entrepreneurship Committee.\nMaryland’s nearly $8 billion share of the infrastructure bill is just the start, Van Hollen said.\n“That’s also a minimum… that’s what Maryland would get when you sort of apply the federal formulas,” he said. “But on top of the formulas, Maryland will be eligible to compete for lots more.” \nThe Bridge Investment Act, a competitive grant program within the bill, allows states to apply for $12.5 billion in financial assistance over five years to improve the safety, reliability and condition of their bridges, as well as nearly $16 billion in national funding for major projects. \n“This transformative legislation will modernize America’s infrastructure, expand broadband access, create jobs for Marylanders, accelerate the adoption of electric vehicles to address the climate crisis, support manufacturing jobs, and bolster transportation safety programs,” Rep. Kweisi Mfume, D-Baltimore, said in a statement.\nAhead of the infrastructure bill’s passage, House progressives were negotiating over commitments to include certain programs in the Build Back Better Act. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-California, told reporters in Glasgow, Scotland, on Tuesday that she has set a vote on the latter bill for next week. \nHoyer on Friday said in a statement: “I am confident that the House will advance this transformational legislation soon and make fully paid-for, generational investments in children, families, communities, and addressing the climate crisis.” \nBiden’s Build Back Better Act framework, among other things, would expand Medicare coverage for hearing benefits, promotes clean energy technology and provides free, universal preschool for 3- and 4-year-olds.\n“For seven years, Maryland has been leading on rebuilding crumbling infrastructure and advancing vital investments for the future like cyber security, broadband, and resiliency,” Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, a Republican, said in a statement Saturday. \nAlso on Saturday, Rep. David Trone, D-Gaithersburg, invited Biden to sign the newly-passed Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act in Cumberland, Maryland. \nCumberland is at the eastern end of the National Road, the main route west for settlers in the early 19th century. Built between 1811 and 1837, the road  much of it is U.S. Route 40  is America’s first federally funded, designed and constructed infrastructure project.\nIn a letter to the president, Trone said the Maryland city would be “the perfect backdrop for the signingbecause of its unparalleled importance in the history of our nation, but also because this legislation will be transformational for the city, county, and region.” \nSince 2017, three bridges, including the Washington Street bridge, linking Washington Street and the West Side community to Cumberland’s city center “have been inoperable due to a lack of infrastructure investment,” Trone said. \n​​“Decades of under-investment in our crumbling infrastructure has taken a toll on every state including Maryland,” Rep. C.A. Dutch Ruppersberger, D-Timonium, said in a statement. “This bill is an opportunity to literally build back from the COVID-19 crisis better than ever. Funding for Maryland’s roads, bridges, waterways and broadband will not only create good-paying jobs, but will keep products and people on the move.”"

    "title": "Hoyer proposes $9 billion trust fund to help reverse global deforestation",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  Following up on one of President Joe Biden’s pledges to combat climate change, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Mechanicsville, introduced legislation on Wednesday aimed at ending global deforestation, creating a $9 billion trust fund to assist developing countries.\n “Addressing the critical challenge of deforestation is an issue I have cared deeply about for many years,” Hoyer said in a statement. “This is an issue that demands urgent action and long-term commitment as part of the broader global effort to confront the climate crisis.” \nThe legislation, formally titled “America Mitigating and Achieving Zero-emissions Originating from Nature for the 21st Century Act,” or “AMAZON21,” would authorize creation of a State Department trust fund for developing countries to reverse deforestation and thus reduce greenhouse gas emissions. \nForests cover 31% of the global land area, with only five countries  Russia, Brazil, Canada, the United States and China, retaining more than half of the world’s forests, according to the UN’s 2020 State of the World Forests report. \nThe bill’s introduction comes after more than 100 countries committed to ending deforestation by 2030 during Tuesday’s international climate summit in Glasgow, Scotland.\nThe world lost 10% of its tree cover between 2001 and 2019, according to Global Forest Watch, an initiative monitoring the planet’s forests. And 27% of that loss was in areas where there was urbanization, farming, logging, wildfires and other factors, the report said.\nIn remarks Tuesday at the summit, Biden announced a “first of its kind” plan to mobilize the federal government, in concert with Congress, to dedicate billions in American aid to conserve and restore global forests and raise billions of dollars more from global partners.\n“Preserving forests and other ecosystems can and should play an important role in meeting our ambitious climate goals as part of the net-zero emissions strategy we all have,” Biden said.\n“If we all work together to make sure these precious resources are conserved in Africa and around the world, forests have the potential to reduce — reduce!  carbon globally by more than one third,” the president said. “So, we need to approach this issue with the same seriousness of purpose as decarbonizing our economies.” \nHoyer said in a tweet shortly after announcing his deforestation bill: “Congress is ready to back up President Biden’s commitments with concrete action.”\nThe legislation will invest in programs that will help developing countries lower greenhouse gas emissions by reducing deforestation.\nTrees soak up carbon dioxide, along with sunlight and water, to make their food, a process known as photosynthesis. This process makes forests what scientists call natural carbon sinks. Protecting natural carbon sinks aids in reducing a leading cause of climate change, Hoyer said.\nMaryland is the nation’s fifth most densely-populated state and of its 6.2 million acres, almost 40% is covered by what experts define as forests, according to the Maryland Department of Natural Resources’s 2020-2025 Forest Action Plan. \n “The anticipated impact of AMAZON21 reflects the seriousness with which we approach this issue: this bill will significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions by the equivalent of taking every passenger car off the road in the U.S. for as many as two years,” Hoyer said."

    "title": "Van Hollen, Cardin push pilot program to curb military vehicle rollover deaths",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  During a May 2019 training exercise at Camp Pendleton in southern California, Marine 1st Lt. H. Conor McDowell of Chestertown, Maryland, was crushed to death when his light armored vehicle dove into a crevasse concealed by tall grass and rolled over. \nJust 24 years old, McDowell recently had been promoted and was days away from being engaged to his girlfriend, Kathleen Borque. \nThe young Marine was one of 123 service members who died in similar tactical vehicle accidents between 2010 and 2019, according to a Government Accountability Office report. \nMaryland Sens. Chris Van Hollen and Ben Cardin, both Democrats, have introduced legislation aimed at curbing such fatal accidents. Their proposed law would be named after McDowell.  \nThe senators’ measure would create a pilot program requiring data recorders to be placed on Army and Marine Corps tactical vehicles.\n“The goal of the pilot program is to improve safety both in training and in vehicle design in order to prevent unnecessary and tragic deaths,” Van Hollen told Capital News Service.\nAdditionally, the bill would require the Army and Marine Corps to use the data recorders to identify near accidents and other potential hazards that would otherwise go undetected. \nThe services also would be required to identify soldiers and Marines who needed more training in handling vehicles. \nMichael McDowell, Conor’s father, said his son would be proud that the legislation is named in his honor, particularly because the family did not ask for that.\n“But this can be his legacy and he can share it with the other young people, many in their teens, who were killed or maimed in preventable training fiascoes,” McDowell said. “We are so proud because it shows how much the country lost.”\n“We remain committed to preventing needless loss of life during military training exercises,” Cardin told Capital News Service in a statement. “The DOD must focus its efforts on addressing this matter.”\nCongress requested the report from the GAO, the nonpartisan auditing agency, regarding military vehicle accidents. The GAO concluded that there was a lack of consistency in training across the Army and Marine Corps, said Cary Russell, the GAO’s director for defense capabilities and management. \nFor example, some military units did not deal with speeding, while others did not enforce the wearing of seatbelts, Russell said. \nBetween October 2019 and July 2021, the GAO team conducted over 100 interviews at nine Army and Marine Corps training ranges to understand the context of safety issues, Russell said. \n“It’s critical to get down and hear first-hand perspectives from the operators and the people living those programs,” he said. “You can only get so much at the command and headquarters levels….” \nThe GAO also found that there was a shortage of safety officers in Army and Marine units.\n“By the time you get to a full-time safety officer in the Marine Corps, you’re talking about a division that has 22,000 Marines with only one safety officer covering them,” Russell said. “We thought that was a concern.” \nMarine Capt. Andrew Wood, a spokesperson for the service, said in a statement to CNS that accidents “are investigated swiftly and thoroughly to identify and ensure appropriate corrective actions take place in order to prevent future occurrences.”\n“Through improvements in our reporting culture and mechanisms, design and acquisition processes, training requirements, and information sharing with Department of Defense partners, the Marine Corps is making every effort to reduce the rate of mishaps,” Wood said.  \nThe GAO report’s nine recommendations, all agreed to by the Department of Defense, include tracking driver proficiency and sharing information about potential hazards before, during and after training events. The recommendations are included in the Maryland senators’ bill. \nVan Hollen said he would hold the Army and Marine Corps accountable in implementing the GAO report recommendations in a timely manner. But he added that the military needed a push by Congress when it came to outfitting tactical vehicles with data recorders.\nVan Hollen expects the legislation will get bipartisan support. \n“Right now we are proposing this as an amendment to the Senate to the National Defense Authorization bill,” Van Hollen said. “I have a pretty high degree of confidence that at the end of the day, this provision will be included in the National Defense Authorization Act….before the end of the year,” he said.\nRep. Anthony Brown, D-Upper Marlboro, introduced similar legislation that passed the House as part of its version of the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2022. \n“Tactical vehicle accidents are preventable if we improve training and ensure a culture of safety within the Marines and Army,” Brown said. “This program establishing data recorders in tactical vehicles will help alert supervisors of potential lapses in safety, ensure accountability and empower our services to make better decisions when and if another accident occurs,” he said.\n The Army and Marine Corps will be in charge of deploying the data recorders to four types of tactical vehicles, including the kind of light armored vehicle that McDowell was killed in. \n“The bottom line here is we want to protect our troops, whether they’re on the battlefield overseas or whether their training for battle here at home,” Van Hollen said.\n“My heart continues to go out to families still grieving the loss of their sons and daughters. We have a responsibility to them to prevent additional tragedies from occurring,” Brown said. \nMcDowell adamantly believes the implementation of safety measures in military vehicles will save the lives of service members and could have saved his son’s life.\n“It does not bring him back, though,” he said. “Thats the hard part.”"

    "title": "Supreme Court hears arguments on Texas abortion law Monday",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  The Supreme Court will hear oral arguments Monday over a Texas law that relies on private citizens to help enforce restrictions on most abortions.\nLaws like the Texas Heartbeat Act go against the nearly 50-year-old precedent set by Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 case in which the court ruled that a pregnant person has the right to procure an abortion.\nWith a more conservative court, pro-choice and pro-life activists are closely watching this case, as well as a challenge to a Mississippi law that the court will hear Dec. 1.\n“We are hopeful, but, of course, not certain that the Supreme Court will substantially rewrite or … overturn the terrible Roe v. Wade precedent,” Joe Pojman, executive director of Texas Alliance for Life, told Capital News Service. “This has been our hope for 48 years … that the Supreme Court will allow states to protect unborn babies from the tragedy of abortion beginning at conception, fertilization.”\nMonica Edwards, federal policy manager for Unite for Reproductive and Gender Equity, a reproductive rights group, said that during their confirmation hearings, recently-appointed Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett said they would not disrupt the Roe v. Wade precedent.\n“And now, despite that, theyve decided to take up a case that clearly violates Roe,” Edwards said. “Its just alarming to see that this is happening. And it definitely puts abortion rights at stake.”\nThe Texas law restricts most abortions when a fetal heartbeat is detected, which is around six weeks after conception, and deputizes private citizens to enforce it. They can sue anyone who aids an abortion, including healthcare providers or someone who paid for an abortion, to potentially receive a reward of $10,000 or more.\nThe Texas law, which went into effect Sept.1, is written to be especially difficult to block, according to legal analysts.\n“If Texas succeeds in this gambit, then there’s nothing to stop other states from cloning what Texas has done,” Laurence Tribe, a U.S. Constitutional law scholar and professor emeritus at Harvard University, told Capital News Service in an interview.\n“And women’s rights to abortion can be sort of extinguished without meaningful judicial protection, which would be, I think, a tragedy, both for women’s rights, human rights and for the rule of law,” he said.\nThe Supreme Court will not focus on the constitutionality of abortion restrictions on Monday, but rather whether the federal government can sue Texas to block the law and whether the use of the public to enforce the law protects the statute from federal judicial review.\nThe Justice Department sued Texas, alleging the law was a violation of the Constitution.\n“(The law) does not rely on the state’s executive branch to enforce the law, as is the norm in Texas and everywhere else,” said Attorney General Merrick Garland in a press conference. “Rather, the statute deputizes all private citizens, without any showing of personal connection or injury, to serve as bounty hunters.”\nThe law has since worked its way through lower federal courts, but currently remains in effect.\nMonday’s hearing on the Texas law comes after thousands of pro-choice demonstrators gathered at the Rally for Abortion Justice in Washington on Oct. 2.\nThe rally was among over 650 similar gatherings across the country, a collective effort from the Women’s March organization and roughly 200 other groups.\nRig Madden, a demonstrator at the Washington rally, said the Supreme Court represents a system of oppression.\n“They want women turned into incubators,” Madden said at the rally.\n“Roe v. Wade is the law of the land,” he said. “Period.”\nIn an emotional Sept. 30 House Oversight and Reform Committee hearing, Democrats and Republicans clashed for hours over the necessity of the hearing and whether abortion should be protected.\n“The ability for a woman to make a decision about the care or the ability to bring a child into this world is not something I feel rests with the government,” Rep. Brenda Lawrence, D-Michigan, said.\nLawrence said 700 women, mostly women of color, die each year from childbirth-related complications.\nLow-income people and marginalized communities feel the impact of these laws most heavily, activists say.\n“People who can afford to have an abortion will be able to travel out of the states, and can go to, say, their surrounding states or somewhere to get an abortion,” said Jennifer Driver, senior director of reproductive rights for the national policy organization State Innovation Exchange.\n“Its low income, its LGBTQ folks, its young people, its people of color who will not be able to have that access.” Driver said.\nPojman says every day the Texas law stays intact is a “victory.”\n“Were not confident, frankly, that this law is going to remain in effect indefinitely because it is not consistent with what we consider to be the terrible Roe v. Wade precedent. But for as long as it lasts, we are celebrating,” he said.\nTribe believes the response from pro-choice activists if Roe v. Wade is overturned “depends (on) whether people rise up andare politically energized to resist this kind of tyranny.”"

    "title": "As millions quit jobs for new opportunities, ‘Great Resignation’ shows no signs of waning",
    "content": "WASHINGTON – From 6 p.m. to 3 a.m., Janika Bates was attending to her jam-packed schedule as a digital producer for Turner Sports, which included watching sports games into the early morning hours, editing game highlights and posting segments of the athletes’ press conference interviews online.\nAfter leaving her job of three years in July, the 26-year-old Atlanta resident now spends her mornings meditating, journaling and reading before creating content for social media.\n“ Everything thats exciting at first gets boring after a while, or it just becomes mundane,” Bates said, reflecting on the position she later described as mentally draining. \nBates became part of a massive flood of people who left their jobs in what Dr. Anthony Klotz, associate professor of management at Texas AM University, dubbed “the Great Resignation,” a COVID pandemic-born phenomenon resulting in a record-high number of people voluntarily quitting their workplaces.\nThe United States Bureau of Labor Statistics at the Labor Department reported Oct. 12 that 4.3 million people quit their jobs in August. That accounts for nearly 3% of the nation’s workforce.\nRemarkably, the number of people who left jobs in August is 43% higher than at the same time a year ago, the statistics show. And nearly every sector of the economy has been affected, particularly the leisure and hospitality industry and in education and health services.\nThere is little sign that the trend is easing: month-over-month numbers have continued to grow in most economic sectors, according to the government figures. \nDr. Christopher Kayes, a professor of management at The George Washington University, said he thinks of “the Great Resignation” more as a “‘great awakening.”’\n“Millions of employees realized that they were unsatisfied with their jobs, their careers, and the opportunities they had for advancement,” he told Capital News Service in an email. \nForced from workplaces at the height of the coronavirus pandemic, many people had time to reassess what was important to them, analysts said.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic served as a catalyst “to get people to reflect on their work, their life, their work-life balance,” said Dr. Richard Klimoski, professor of psychology and management at George Mason University. “Maybe even think about their future and what they want out of life.”\nAna Skoumal, a 30-year-old Chicago resident, said her job at Dennemeyer  Associates, an international law firm, was considered a dream job by most law students, but the pandemic put everything in perspective for her.\nAna Skoumal joined the Great Resignation after long work hours at an international law firm. (Courtesy of Ana Skoumal)\nThe former third-year associate said she wanted to have control over being able to work a normal work day.\nDuring her first year or so at the firm, she said, she worked 100 hours a week and was pulling one to two all-nighters every week. \nSkoumal said the workload increased over the years and it felt like it vastly increased during the pandemic. But the pay didn’t necessarily match with what she was happy with, she said.\nNow she has started her own firm that specializes in trademark law.\n“I’m fine working 100 hours a week for myself,” Skoumal said. “COVID really put things into perspective for me, and I really just thought, ‘What am I doing?’” \nNo amount of a raise or bonus, however, would have changed Skoumal’s mind that she wanted to quit her job and start her own business, she said. \nLevon Myers, 27, of Fairfax, Virginia, said he’s starting a freelance marketing business after quitting his job in July at Badger Sports Properties, the corporate sponsorship marketing division of University of Wisconsin Athletics. \nAfter leaving college, Myers said he was ecstatic about getting the job. But last year, he said, he started to feel like maybe it was time to see what other opportunities were out there. \nMyers said he felt that he wasn’t being fairly compensated for his work and he wasn’t necessarily getting the recognition he deserved. \n“Its just pretty standard corporate structure where if youre at the bottom, you dont get any of the recognition and the people above you are getting all the pats on the back and collecting the big paycheck and youre just fighting for scraps at the bottom,” he said. \nErnesto Uribe, a service advisor at a car dealership, said he’s been thinking about leaving his job for months, but he needs the money.  \nThe 28-year-old from Linthicum Heights, Maryland, said the biggest reason why he’s thinking about quitting is because of management, which he described as non-existent. \nUribe said he’s kind of mentally checked out from his job, and “at some point you got to question yourself, is the stress even worth the money, and that’s kind of where I’ve been ”\nThat stress is common in many jobs, experts say.\n“Too many employers have failed to take seriously human emotions in the workplace,” Kayes wrote. “Human resource policies ignored burnout, the (importance) of building resilience, and the overall physical and mental well-being of employees.”\nDr. Robert Harbert of Roanoke, Virginia, said some factors in his decision to quit his job as an assistant professor of biology at Stonehill College in Massachusetts included a lack of support from his employer and a lack of wage increases. \n“The institution was putting financial success over taking care of the people that actually put all the work in,” he said.  \nNow he works as a consultant in the pharmaceutical industry, where he said the pay is better and the expectation of the number of hours worked is lower. \nSohaib Athar, 44, of Islamabad, Pakistan, is a former vice president of engineering in the AI field for a unicorn, which is a start-up with a value of at least $1 billion. \nAs the company grew, “the direction that the business and the culture were moving towards slowly deviated from my personal values and beliefs, until I could see that staying there any more would be detrimental to my health and happiness,” he told CNS in an email about his August resignation.\nSome effects of the mass exit of people leaving their jobs may include more automated jobs, better pay and benefits and greater attention to work-family balance, according to Klimoski.\n“I am glad that COVID came with the silver lining of making us … aware of our mortality and the limited time we have on this planet, and urged us to take a step back and scrutinize our lives, get our priorities in order and change them for the better,” Athar said."

    "title": "Questions and answers about the upcoming climate summit in Scotland",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  President Joe Biden is set to attend the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Glasgow, Scotland, starting on Monday. The conference, referred to as COP26, is the first opportunity for Biden to try to convince the international community that the United States is committed to a greener future by addressing climate change. Here’s a primer on the conference.\nWhat is COP26?\n“COP” stands for “Conference of the Parties,” a formal way to say a summit. This year’s gathering also is known as the annual United Nations Climate Change Conference. It is the 26th such meeting, dating back to 1995. \nThe summit will take place in Glasgow from Oct. 31 to Nov. 12. Parties involved in the conference are the signatories of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, a treaty agreed to in 1994 by 196 nations and the European Union. \nCOP’s influence on international climate regulation reached its peak in 2015 with the signing of the Paris Agreement. \n“It was ‘top down’ in that every country – no matter how big or small – signed up to cutting carbon emissions to limit global warming to well below 2 degrees and ideally to 1.5 degrees above pre industrial levels,” The United Nations said in a statement. “And it was ‘bottom up’ in that it left room for each individual country to decide how they would get there.”\nWhy is this conference so important?\nIn the signing of the Paris Agreement, each nation vowed to set its own non-binding emissions reduction targets and to outline actions to meet the agreement’s targets every five years. \nAlthough long-term goals were due from each nation by 2020, the global coronavirus pandemic postponed that deadline by a year. \nThis meeting is particularly important for the United States, which rejoined the Paris Agreement on Biden’s first day in office after former President Donald Trump formally withdrew the United States from the pact in November 2020. \nBiden announced that the nation was committed to cutting emissions by 50%-52% below 2005 levels by 2030. \n“In this make-or-break moment for our planet, the Biden administration has taken swift action to restore our commitment to address the climate crisis and chart a course towards a pollution-free, 100% clean energy future for all,” Jill Tauber, vice president of litigation for Climate  Energy, said in a statement. \n“The target announced… is achievable, consistent with science, and in line with President Biden’s climate goals, Tauber said It is a powerful signal to the world that the U.S. is serious about meeting the goals of the Paris Agreement and advancing bold climate solutions quickly and equitably.”\nWhat is President Biden’s stance on climate?\nThe fight against climate change and especially the implementation of clean energy has been a cornerstone of Biden’s political agenda since the start of his presidential campaign in April 2019. It took him less than 24 hours after entering the White House to rejoin the Paris Agreement. \n“The president and I and our administration are unwavering in our commitment to these issues,” Vice President Kamala Harris said in a meeting on Monday with a number of top climate activists. “Absolutely unwavering.”\nThe president’s crown jewel in his first year in office, his “Build Back Better” package, includes monumental clean-energy provisions. The bill, if passed in Congress, would be the nation’s most significant step on climate to date and would be the first step in hitting the Paris Agreement’s goal. \n“We thank you for your leadership and bold vision on Build Back Better,” Senator Chris Van Hollen, D-Maryland, said in a letter to Biden jointly written with Senator Edward Markey, D-Massachusetts, and Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Washington. “We urge you to secure a Build Back Better deal that meets the climate test before COP26 so that you can walk into Glasgow with historic investments in climate action, good-paying union jobs, and a more just economy.”\nHow is Congress having an impact on the American position at COP26?\nWhile Biden’s bill will likely meet the COP26 requirements if passed, it’s not entirely up to him whether Build Back Better comes to fruition. \nThe complicated legislation needs 50 votes  plus Harris’s  in the Senate to survive, and the chamber is split evenly between the two parties. Nearly every Democrat is in favor of Build Back Better as it stands, with $500 billion being allocated towards clean energy. The key is Senator Joe Manchin, D-West Virginia, which is a coal-producing state. \n“(Manchin) didnt like the provisions that were in the presidents proposal,” Senator Angus King, I-Maine, said on NBC’s “Meet the Press”. “But I dont think that necessarily means that hes, you know, death on climate legislation.”\nBiden, along with many other Democrats in Congress, has negotiated with Manchin throughout the fall over clean energy and other unrelated provisions. \nUltimately, the bill was reduced from the initial $3.5 trillion to roughly $1.75 trillion. The largest reduction in the bill, which addresses an array of social spending issues, came from climate and clean-energy measures that target fossil fuels like coal. Climate provisions still exist in the bill, nearly $600 billion of them, but it is still unclear how much of that will survive if additional negotiations prove necessary. \n“I think the most unfortunate part about losing the provisions of the reconciliation bill is that it weakens Joe Bidens hands in Glasgow…” King said. “If were going to get the rest of the world to take serious steps to remedy this problem, weve got to do it ourselves.”\nWhat are other nations doing ahead of COP26?\nMost governments that are part of the Paris Agreement are sending high-ranking officials to the summit. Biden is scheduled to be in Glasgow for the first few days and will be joined by the leaders of nations like France, Canada and India. \nThe United States is the world’s second-largest emitter of greenhouse gases behind China. President Xi Jinping, who has not left China since 2020 and has reported that he will not for the remainder of 2021, is not going to attend the conference. Russian President Vladimir Putin also will not be in attendance. \n“If it’s not possible in person because of Xi’s travel constraints, doing it by virtual meeting is the next best thing. That’s what we’re intending to do,” National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said in a Tuesday briefing for reporters.  “And we’re intending to do that because, in an era of intense competition between the U.S. and China, intense diplomacy at the highest levels, leader-level diplomacy is vital to effectively managing this relationship.”\nWhat is Biden trying to achieve in Glasgow?\nAside from outlining long-term U.S. plans to combat climate change, Biden will work with leaders from other developed nations to call on developing countries such as China, India and South Africa to limit their emissions. \nThe United States and much of Europe, have committed to mobilizing roughly $100 billion annually through 2025 to fund clean-energy technologies in poorer nations around the globe. \nIf the president’s Build Back Better agenda is not passed, he may have a difficult time pushing other nations to enact change. \n“The only thing that’s serious about President Biden’s environmental agenda is the trouble it’s already causing here at home,” Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, said in a speech on the Senate floor. “Our adversaries like Russia are salivating over big windfalls while working American families are feeling the pain.”"

    "title": "Abortion bans disproportionately impact marginalized communities, activists say",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  As reproductive rights are being restricted in nearly two dozen states, marginalized communities, including people of color and LGBTQ people, are being disproportionately impacted, according to activists.\nA variety of abortion restrictions have been passed in 21 states, with others pending in state legislatures, according to data assembled by the Guttmacher Institute, a policy research center focused on abortion issues. Many of those laws are facing legal challenges.\nOne of those laws, the Texas Heartbeat Act, prohibits most abortions after a fetal heartbeat is detected, which happens around six weeks after conception, is one of the most restrictive, causing some Texans to flee the state to terminate their pregnancies.\nThe law, which the United States Supreme Court initially declined to hear in early September, is now slated for oral arguments in the court on Monday. The court will not rule directly on the constitutionality of the Texas law, but whether the Department of Justice can sue to block its implementation.\nThe high court will hear a challenge to a Mississippi abortion law, which bans most abortions after 15 weeks, on Dec. 1.\nAbortion is often framed as a women’s issue, but activists push back, saying abortion restrictions also more broadly impact the LGBTQ community as well as other marginalized people.\n“Since the founding of this country, the point has been to oppress and control those who are not cisgender, white, heterosexual men,” said Monica Edwards, federal policy manager for Unite for Reproductive and Gender Equity, a national reproductive rights advocacy organization. “So naturally, people of color and LGBTQIA+ folks have always been oppressed and disproportionately impacted by things like abortion restrictions.”\n“We dont talk about abortion access for transgender or nonbinary folks, we talk about it in this context of women,” Jennifer Driver, senior director of reproductive rights for the national policy organization State Innovation Exchange, told Capital News Service. “Abortion access isn’t a cis- issue. Theres most definitely a bias. This notion that only a cis-identified woman can get an abortion and we are constantly reminding folks that no, no, no  trans and nonbinary folks need abortion access.”\nAn estimated 462 to 530 trans and nonbinary people received abortion care in 2017, according to a recent study from the Guttmacher Institute.\nThe estimate may be low because abortion-providing clinics do not always collect data on patients’ gender identities.\nPro-choice activists say limiting abortion in ways that require people to travel out-of-state to get the procedure creates an outsized impact on some groups, including people of color and LGBTQ people who are more likely to experience economic hardship.\nAffordability of care can cause issues for even those trying to seek abortion services locally.\n“Just because its legal in my state, doesnt mean that I can actually have access to it,” Driver said.\nFor example, “if queer and trans folks of color have lower income levels or higher poverty levels, they have less access to some of these services,” Driver said. “And so those have dire impacts on those in that community.”\nThe anti-abortion group Texas Right to Life filed an amicus brief in the Mississippi abortion law case, known as Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, which also expressed disdain for what the group called, “the court-invented rights to homosexual behavior and same-sex marriage.”\nIn a subsection of the brief concerning impacts the overturning of Roe v. Wade could have on other court precedents, the group explains, “These ‘rights,’ like the right to abortion from Roe, are judicial concoctions, and there is no other source of law that can be invoked to salvage their existence.”\nThe brief adds that such rights are not deeply rooted in the nation’s history, and therefore cannot be described as fundamental rights. Referencing two cases that protected gay rights, the group concluded the section saying that Lawrence v. Texas and Obergefell v. Hodges are “far less hazardous to human life, (but) are as lawless as Roe.”\nReproductive rights activists say restrictions placed on how federal funding can be used in healthcare, like the Hyde amendment, limit abortion access. Groups that disproportionately experience poverty are also more likely to rely on federal healthcare plans, like Medicaid.\nThe Hyde amendment, which was first passed in 1976, currently restricts the use of federal funds for abortions, except when a pregnancy results from rape or incest or endangers the life of a pregnant person.\nAmong Medicaid beneficiaries, 61.1% identify as non-white or are in a non-white ethnic group, according to an April 2021 fact sheet from the Medicaid and CHIP Payment Access Commission, which is a non-partisan federal agency that advises Congress and the executive branch.\nSen. Patty Murray, D-Washington, introduced a health and human services appropriations bill on Oct. 18 without the Hyde amendment.\n“Every single person deserves to make their own decisions about pregnancy and parenting — but right now, the unacceptable reality is that the choices available to you still depend on your income, your zip code, or how you get your health insurance,” Murray said in a statement. “Right now, too many people can’t exercise their right to an abortion because of federal abortion coverage restrictions, or can’t afford the family planning services they need. That’s unfair and unjust — especially for women who have low incomes and people of color.”\nPaula Saldaña, a Texas field coordinator at the National Latina Institute for Reproductive Justice, said U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement highway checkpoints create additional obstacles. She explained there are checkpoints 100 miles from the border that trap some people from leaving their communities to seek abortions in other states.\n“ We believe that everyone should have access to reproductive health care — the full range, including abortion care,” Saldaña said. “Regardless of their income, their race, their immigration status.”\nThe Texas abortion law is unique because it deputizes private citizens to enforce it.\nThe Texas statute’s “vigilante justice scheme poses a significant threat to Black and Latinx communities, who are already subjected to race-based surveillance, policing, and violence by the state, and who now fear the same from their neighbors,” Ianthe Metzger, a spokeswoman for Planned Parenthood Federation of America, told CNS in an email.\nAbortion restrictions like those in Texas and Mississippi, “didnt come out of thin air,” Edwards said. “Theyre just simply manifestations of centuries of white supremacy and misogyny.”\nAs the Supreme Court hears upcoming arguments on the Texas and Mississippi laws, pro-choice advocates say the future of abortion access is on the line.\n“There already is this scenario of haves and have nots, and who has access and who doesnt,” Driver said. “I think we will see two state scenarios — those statesprotecting access, and those states where the devastating impact will fall most on those who are already marginalized.”"

    "title": "988 suicide line on its way, but states might not be ready",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  A new three-digit phone number for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, set to launch next July, is expected to increase the use of mental health crisis services as access becomes easier.\nBut advocacy organizations worry some states may not have the funding or capacity to support increased use of the “988” hotline and its related programs.\n“Were envisioning the number to be a way to really transform the way national crisis response is handled in the United States,” Laurel Stine, senior vice president of public policy for the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, told Capital News Service. “Its a pivotal moment for the mental health and behavioral health community.”\nThe “988” line is intended to be a faster, easy-to-remember way to get help in a mental health emergency. Calls to the new number will be routed to the already-in-existence National Suicide Prevention Lifeline.\nThe Maryland Department of Health is expecting an increase in the volume of calls and messages once 988 goes live, spokesman David McCallister said in an email to CNS.\n“We expect contact volume to increase due to ease of remembering a three-digit number,” McCallister said.\nAn increase in calls means additional costs for local crisis centers in the hotline network that field calls and provide care.\nMcCallister said the federal government has provided funding to states, including Maryland, through the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 to support these services. Maryland is using those funds to support crisis call centers, he said.\nThe state has also submitted a draft plan addressing issues like funding and capacity to Vibrant Emotional Health, the administrator of the hotline. McCallister said the department is awaiting feedback on the draft plan. The finalized plan is due in January.\nAccording to a state legislation map provided by the mental health advocacy group National Alliance on Mental Illness, only 20 states so far have even proposed 988-related bills for funding and implementation.\nFederal funding for the hotline flows through the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. According to a press release from that agency, the Biden Administration’s proposed budget for Fiscal Year 2022 allots $102 million for the transition to 988, in addition to separate funding for other suicide prevention programs.\nThe proposed federal funding is “significant,” according to Stine. “However, we believe that additional resources are needed.”\nCost estimates for one year of nationwide implementation for the three-digit number go as high as $240 million, she explained.\nWhen Congress cleared the way for the establishment of the three-digit number with the passage of the National Suicide Hotline Designation Act of 2020 last fall, it included provisions to allow individual states to levy taxes on phone bills to help fund and implement the hotline and crisis intervention services that would follow calls for assistance. That bill was signed into law by then-President Donald Trump.\nFour states so far have passed bills including phone bill fees for this purpose. One signed into law in Virginia establishes a 12-cent fee for most wireless phone plans, and an 8-cent fee for prepaid wireless plans, which will fund crisis call centers in the state.\nBut because individual states need to develop their own funding and implementation plans, there is some concern among mental health advocates that they won’t all be ready for the “988” launch less than nine months from now.\n“This kind of crisis infrastructure is going to take a lot of communities some time to develop, but they need to get started now,” said Angela Kimball, national director of government relations, policy and advocacy for the National Alliance on Mental Illness.\n“The real fear though, is that if people call 988 and expect a mental health response, we want them to get a mental health response,” Kimball said. “We dont want what weve always had, which is typically a law enforcement response.”\nKimball explained that police calls to mental health emergencies have sometimes led to arrests, inappropriate uses of emergency departments and hospitals, as well as deaths.\n“That kind of trauma and tragedy is the last thing that we need,” Kimball said.\nOn average, 130 people die by suicide every day in the United States, according to the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention. As a result, crisis intervention and care are major public policy priorities for mental health advocacy organizations.\nThose groups say the work doesn’t stop at providing the hotline — there needs to be a system that addresses the need for care after someone calls.\n“There is a subset of people, about three in 10, for whom the phone call isnt going to be enough,” Kimball explained.\nIn 2020, the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline received 2.4 million calls.\nOf those calls, 42,934 came from Maryland. About two-thirds of those Marylanders were connected with one of the eight crisis centers covering all regions in the state.\nThese crisis centers are facilities for people experiencing a mental health crisis where they can receive evaluation, care and referrals for more long-term treatment. Advocates say they are more effective and humane alternatives to placing someone in a hospital emergency department during a mental health crisis.\n“A lot of our work is focused on the states in order to ensure that states take up legislation to fund the work,” Stine said. “And so were devoting a lot of our time to this.”\nThe 988 three-digit hotline is not yet operational. If you are struggling with thoughts of suicide, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1(800)273-8255 or visit its website at https://suicidepreventionlifeline.org/."

    "title": "Against backdrop of instability in Haiti, Cardin and Rubio press for more U.S. engagement",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  The recent kidnapping of missionaries in Haiti illustrates just one of the many dangers that Haitians are trying to escape from and are being sent back to — and that bipartisan legislation in Congress is seeking to address.\nThe Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Tuesday passed legislation co-sponsored by Sens. Ben Cardin, D-Maryland, and Marco Rubio, R-Fla., that aims to build relationships among independent civil society groups in Haiti to combat corruption, crime, violence and human rights abuses. The measure also requires the State Department to report human rights abuses in Haiti.\n“Everyday life for the Haitian people remains a constant struggle as one disaster piled on top of another,” Cardin said in a statement after the bill passed. He is a member of the foreign relations panel. \n“We are greatly concerned that an unstable Haitian government, rife with corruption, will ignore or even enable further human rights abuses,” the senator added. “UNICEF has reported that 1.6 million people, including 800,000 children, in Haiti are in dire need of humanitarian assistance. The United States must take a more active role in helping our neighbors emerge from this ongoing crisis.”\nRubio, also a member of the committee, said that “a secure and stable Haiti not only benefits Haitians on the island, but also America.” \n“We must continue to support Haitis democratic process, push for transparency and accountability in the ongoing investigations, as well as help strengthen Haitis future,” he said.\nThe Haiti Development, Accountability, and Institutional Transparency Initiative Act was introduced in April, as Haitians continued to flee what many international observers consider a failed state. \nThe passage of the bill came just two days after a Haitian gang kidnapped 17 missionaries near the capital of Port-au-Prince. The group, working through the Ohio-based Christian Aid Ministries, includes 16 Americans and one Canadian. \n“The recent kidnapping in Haiti of U.S. missionaries and their children is horrible,” House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Mechanicsville, said in a statement to Capital News Service Friday. \n“They must be released immediately. I am thankful the FBI and State Department are engaged. I am hopeful their work, in collaboration with local authorities, can bring these individuals home safely and ensure the perpetrators are brought to justice,” Hoyer said. \nHaiti has a perfect storm of factors leading people to migrate, according to Dr. John Ciorciari, associate professor of public policy and director of the International Policy Center and Weiser Diplomacy Center at the University of Michigan. \n“Its a good illustration of how weak the security provision is in the country if a gang can kidnap a large number of American missionaries, and the authorities cannot either prevent or immediately address the situation,” Ciorciari said. \nCiorciari said Haiti has suffered from abusive and ineffective security services that are unable to pinpoint violence linked to gang conflict, drug trafficking and political rivalries. \n“You layer on top of the insecurity in the country, the economic crisis, this relatively unchecked spread of COVID-19 and another devastating earthquake — there are simply many reasons why ordinary Haitians would be seeking to flee the country,” Ciorciari said. \nU.S. organizations working in Haiti have also experienced this violence and instability first-hand. \n“The dangers are not just for people who come into Haiti, but for the people who live on the ground also,” said Katiana Anglade, development and operations director at the Lambi Fund of Haiti, a Washington-based nonprofit that provides resources to Haitian grassroots efforts.\nAnglade said Haitian gangs will block off roads, which prevents the organization from getting to Haiti’s rural areas.\n“The only way that Lambiis able to continue the work that we do in the countryside is because we have regional monitors who are stationedcloser to the areas of the projects that we support,” Anglade said. \nThe recent kidnapping of missionaries in Haiti comes just weeks after the controversial apprehension and mass deportation of Haitian migrants in Del Rio, Texas, at the U.S.-Mexico border. \nPhotographs depicted Border Patrol agents using horse reins as whips and corralling Haitian migrants like sheep. \n“Most of the Haitians who were in those terrible pictures that surfaced a few weeks ago were not coming directly from Haiti; they were mostly coming from Central and South America,” Ciorciari said, speaking to the often long and difficult journey to get to the United States. \nU.S. immigration policies continue to prevent Haitian migrants from entering the United States. \nOne such policy, called Title 42, began in March 2020 out of concern for the spread of COVID-19 at border facilities. It prohibits asylum seekers at land borders from entry, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection. \nBut Ciorciari said a special category called Temporary Protected Status could provide a solution for Haitians fleeing the country. \n“(TPS) is not the same as granting people asylum, but it provides, as the name suggests, temporary protection for people who are in dire circumstances, often because of natural disasters or because of other crises of that nature,” Ciorciari said. \n“Thats something the (Biden) administration can undertake without necessarily granting asylum, which is a much narrower category that depends on a well-founded fear of future persecution based on politics, race, nationality and so on, and TPS is a vehicle very much at the administrations disposal,” Ciorciari said. \nAnglade emphasized how Haitian migrants want to make a life for themselves in the United States. \n“No one is looking to just come live for free, but they just need an opportunity to live and take care of their families,” Anglade said. \n“All they’re looking for is a chance,” she said."

    "title": "With holidays ahead, small businesses struggle with supply chain disruptions",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  Cecily Habimana, co-founder of Sew Creative Lounge, a sewing school in Mount Rainier, Maryland, normally imports her fabric from China and West Africa, but international shipping and customs delays have become unaffordable for the small business owner. \n“I can’t afford to bear the cost of a big shipment so I pre-order fabric, but this season because of delays, there is no way for me to know exactly when it’s coming in,” Habimana told Capital News Service. \nWith the holidays approaching, small businesses like Habimana’s are feeling the brunt of supply chain delays that have drawn the intercession of the White House and the attention of Congress. \n“I can’t remember a time in history when (the supply and demand model) has been inverted, where one side dictates to the other in a way that has never happened before,” Rep. Kweisi Mfume, D-Baltimore, said at a Wednesday hearing of the House Small Business Committee’s oversight, investigations and regulation subcommittee. The panel heard testimony about the impact of supply chain disruptions on small companies.\nThe pandemic forced many factories overseas to shut down, dramatically reducing production. There are also shortages of ships, containers and truck drivers. \nThe lack of coordination among transportation and logistics industries is at the root of the disruptions, said Dr. Martin Dresner, professor of logistics and public policy at University of Maryland’s Smith School of Business.\n“Just saying let’s have more throughput at the port probably will not solve the problem if there’s not enough truck drivers to take those containers away from the port,” Dresner said.\nCLINTON, Md. — Despite full shelves at AwardsPlus, the company’s owner says she has been feeling the effects of supply chain disruptions since the beginning of last year. (Photo courtesy of Patty MacCrory)\nThe Port of Baltimore, however, is an exception to supply bottlenecks.\nThe Port of Baltimore is not experiencing supply chain congestion issues that are impacting other ports, Maryland Port Administration Executive Director William P. Doyle told CNS in a statement. “In fact, due to congestion at other ports we have recently attracted two new container services totaling 21 new ships.”\nHe added that the port has been preparing for over a decade for the expanded Panama Canal and we are one of the only ports on the East Coast with a 50-foot deep channel and berthing for ultra large vessels.\nIn addition, our local market has built up an efficient warehousing network over the past six years with millions of square feet of distribution, sorting, and fulfillment centers spread throughout Maryland and the mid-Atlantic — Amazon, Home Depot, IKEA, Fed Ex, and Floor and Decor to name a few, Doyle said.\nNevertheless, some Maryland small businesses are struggling with supply chain disruptions.\n“Its not a new problem, it’s something that’s been going on for a really long time,” said Patty MacCrory, owner and president of AwardsPlus, a company that makes trophies, plaques and promotional items in Clinton, Maryland. She said she has seen supply chain problems since January 2020.\nLarger companies like Walmart and Target have leverage to demand products in a way smaller businesses just cannot do, said Rich Weissman, adjunct professor of supply chain operations at Lesley University in Massachusetts. \n“Big business gets what they demand and small business doesn’t,” Weissman said.\nSupplies on ships at a standstill out in the ocean are causing cash flow issues for these small businesses, said Michael Kelleher, executive director of the Maryland Manufacturing Extension Partnership, a non-profit funded by industry and the state of Maryland that works in coordination with the National Institute of Standards and Technology. Each state has a similar program. \nU.S. manufacturing that migrated overseas needs to be re-established domestically, according to Kelleher.\n“Long term this is very eye-opening for Maryland, and for domestic manufacturing, in that we need to bring some things back on shore and build back some of the expertise that we’ve lost domestically over the last 20 years,” Kelleher said.\nIn addition, Kelleher said, “most of what we make in Maryland is not direct to the consumer and most of it goes into other products.” \n“Those delayed repercussions tend to have an exponential effect as they trickle downstream,” he said.\nKelleher’s program aids small businesses in handling supply chain backlogs by showing them how to communicate with customers, manage customer expectations and adjust cash flows. \nSuch steps can help to save small businesses from devastating consequences, Kelleher said. \nHabimana, who began purchasing locally-made fabrics when shipping costs first skyrocketed, said she will return to buying fabric in China and West Africa once prices go back down.\nChina is the only reliable manufacturer she has found, Habimana said. With a customer base predominantly purchasing her African-printed fabrics, Habimana wants her purchases to benefit the people living in those countries.\nStill, even with a domestic supplier of materials, inventory selection has been greatly affected, MacCrory said.\nCustomers have been reasonable and understanding when it comes to product availability, MacCrory said, but the current situation has really impacted her ability to get inventory, especially wood.\nWhen a customer requests an item that is not in stock, MacCrory said she turns to a stockpile of substitute products that she offers instead.\nTo accommodate the growing alternatives, MacCrory said she will add a second warehouse next month.\nTeaching small businesses how to manage during supply chain disruptions is imperative because the current shortages are not an isolated event, Kelleher said. \nIn an effort to alleviate the supply chain backlog, President Joe Biden last week won agreement from the nations busiest port, the Port of Los Angeles, to remain open 24 hours a day, seven days a week. \nThat follows a similar expansion in operations at the neighboring Port of Long Beach. The two ports together account for about 40 percent of container shipments into the United States. \n“The commitments being made today are a sign of major progress in moving goods from manufacturers to a store or to your front door,” the president said.\nBut there is no immediate fix, something consumers and businesses will need to adjust to, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg warned.\nA lot of the challenges that we have been experiencing this year will continue into next year, Buttigieg said on CNN Sunday. \nWeissman does not believe regulation or government intervention will make a difference in the supply chain disruptions in the coming months. \n“We need to realize we have been through a massive economic shock and its not over,” Weissman said. “Let the system play and let it work.”\nFor small business owners especially, the next few months could determine who survives and who goes under. \nAfter holiday shopping sprees last December, many of her customers stopped spending for a bit, Habimana said. \n“I try to make sure whatever we are doing we try to circumvent those profitability issues that could hurt us this season,” Habimana said."

    "title": "Maryland needs to do more to enforce anti-lead laws, advocates say",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  Although Maryland prides itself on thorough lead risk and reduction regulations, some advocates are calling on the state to boost spending on those programs and improve enforcement. \nThe Environmental Protection Agency announced a new lead training and prevention effort on Sept. 27 in 11 communities in 9 states and Puerto Rico. The EPA will train contractors in lead renovation, repair and painting and hold sessions for local officials to educate their own areas on lead exposure and prevention.  \nMaryland was not included in the EPA initiative –– a decision that did not sit well with Maryland Sen. Jill Carter, D-Baltimore, where some communities have been plagued with lead paint issues for years. \n“I would hope that we would be included in any and all initiatives because its been a scourge and the most widespread environmental hazard on Maryland’s children that exists,” Carter told Capital News Service. “There’s an opportunity for people that are in poor neighborhoods, not only to make money, but to find jobs in this, and so we need all of those resources, especially post-pandemic, that we can get.” \nThe senator is a member of the Lead Poisoning Prevention Commission inside the state Department of the Environment. The commission evaluates the effectiveness of the state’s lead reduction efforts.\n“To our knowledge this was not a grant program where the state had an opportunity to apply for consideration,” said Jay Apperson, deputy director of the department’s communications office. \nThe department’s efforts to reduce childhood lead poisoning and enforce Maryland’s lead law have continued over the COVID-19 pandemic and have expanded under the Maryland Healthy Children Act, according to Apperson.\nUnder the act, Apperson said environmental investigations now include diagnoses at or above the CDC’s blood lead reference level of 5 micrograms per deciliter, compared to the previous threshold level of 10 or more micrograms per deciliter. \n“This allows (the department) to reach a new population and represents an important opportunity for the department for early intervention and to evaluate and address any noncompliance with state lead laws applicable to owners of pre-1978 residential rental properties,” Apperson said. \nThe national strategy for lead poisoning reduction and prevention has three main parts, according to Dr. David Jacobs, research director and chief scientist at the National Center for Healthy Housing, a nonprofit organization based in Columbia, Maryland. \nFirst, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention tracks the number of children and adults poisoned with lead.\nThen, the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development provides funding for low-income, privately-owned homes. \nAnd, third, the EPA sets exposure standards, trains individuals and communities and ensures that workers have the proper certifications and licenses.  \n“The accredited training standards in Maryland far exceed the EPA (lead mitigation) standard,” said Ruth Ann Norton, president and CEO of the Green  Healthy Homes Initiative, a Baltimore-based national nonprofit dedicated to improving housing conditions. \nNorton said she was not surprised that Maryland was not part of the EPA’s new initiative. \n“The work that the EPA is doing is extending and spreading out the efforts around that training throughout the country, so theyre building additional capacity around the country,” Norton said. \nJust over 0.2 percent of children in Maryland had elevated levels of lead in their blood (at 10 or more micrograms per deciliter) in 2019 –– a 99 percent decrease since the earliest data recorded in 1993, according to a report from the Maryland Department of the Environment.\n“All of this is improving now in 2021 from what it was a decade ago and two decades ago, but until we have no lead-poisoned children, we just havent done enough,” Carter said. \nLead, a metal that serves no useful biological function, can poison children and cause long-term behavioral and developmental problems.  \n“That early, early lead poisoning has irreparable damage to cognitive development, (including) reading (and) reasoning abilities,” Norton said. “Then from there, it’s just collateral damage on kidneys, on (the) heart and on long-term health.” \nAlthough lead poisoning has a range of sources, the majority of cases originate in lead-based paint, according to Norton. Older homes typically have higher lead levels compared to newer dwellings.\nIn 1978, the federal government banned lead as an ingredient in paint used in residential structures.   \nUnder Maryland’s Reduction of Lead Risk in Housing Law, rental property owners must register rental properties built before 1978 through the Maryland Department of the Environment.  \nRental owners also have to distribute educational resources on lead poisoning to their tenants and meet lead-paint risk reduction standards. \nBut the law excludes pre-1978 homes, which leaves a number of lead-ridden places in Maryland uninspected. \n“There still remains a large number of older houses in Maryland that still have lead paint hazards,” Jacobs said.   \nMaryland also requires universal blood tests for lead in children in order to catch higher levels as early as possible.\nRegardless of testing, medical professionals cannot reverse any elevated lead levels.  \n“If you poison a kid with lead at the age of two, you can spend millions of dollars in social service dollars for the rest of their lifetime, but you will not reverse the brain damage,” Norton said. \nNorton and other advocates urged Maryland to provide more funding and enforcement of the lead laws. \n“We know exactly how to identify lead hazards, we know how to fix them, and we know what it costs, and we need to be able to have the funding to do that work,” Norton said. \nCarter said paint companies should be held financially responsible for poisoning children with lead in Maryland and thinks this would offer the best source of funding for current lead laws. \nCarter said Maryland should hire more lead inspectors and to make sure they have integrity in their inspections, pointing to previous ties with property owner organizations and slumlords. \nMaryland is no stranger to the irreversible impacts of lead poisoning in children. \n“Its been a culture in Baltimore that slumlords have capitalized off of poor people who cant afford safe housing and have no choice except to live in this dilapidated, substandard, toxic-lead housing stock,” Carter said. \nFreddie Gray, a 25-year-old Black man who died in 2015 at the hands of Baltimore law enforcement, had elevated levels of lead in his blood.  \nAt the age of three, Grays blood lead levels hit close to 10 times over what the CDC contemplates will soon be the new threshold level, according to Norton. \n“I think what has to be deeply understood is: Freddie Gray represents tens and tens of thousands of children that have come through Maryland with similar experiences,” Norton said. \nGray’s elevated blood levels speak to the disproportionate rates of lead poisoning in low-income communities and in communities of color. \nCarter also said there is a link between Black youth in the juvenile justice system and elevated levels of lead in their blood.\n“And so, police reform, juvenile justice reform, lead abatement –– all of that goes hand-in-hand,” Carter said. “Any society thats really committed to racial reckoning and equity has to address this issue.”"

    "title": "Democrats in Congress press Biden to extend COVID-related prisoner releases",
    "content": "WASHINGTON — Citing the case of a Baltimore grandmother who was briefly returned to prison for a technical violation, five Maryland lawmakers are urging the Biden administration to reverse a Justice Department opinion that could reincarcerate as many as 4,500 people now serving sentences at home once the COVID pandemic eases.\nUnder a provision of the coronavirus relief package that became law last year, the Federal Bureau of Prisons was given the authority to transfer to home confinement inmates who were near the end of their sentences and posed no risk to their communities — a move aimed at reducing the spread of COVID inside overcrowded prisons.\nBut a Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) opinion, issued five days before President Donald Trump left office, concluded that those released to home confinement would have to go back to prison once the COVID emergency is declared over.\n“Recalling these individuals to prison does not serve the public interest,” the Maryland lawmakers wrote to Attorney General Merrick Garland on Sept. 17. They warned of “the harmful consequences of permitting the current opinion to stand and the importance of finding compassionate solutions for this group of Americans.”\nThe letter was signed by Democratic Sens. Ben Cardin and Chris Van Hollen and Reps. Kweisi Mfume, D-Baltimore, Dutch Ruppersberger, D-Timonium, and John Sarbanes, D-Towson.\nDonald Murphy, a public affairs spokesperson for the Federal Bureau of Prisons, declined to comment to Capital News Service about whether the OLC opinion is being actively reviewed by the Biden administration.  \n\nIn their letter, the lawmakers referred to the circumstances of Gwen Levi, a 76-year-old Baltimorean grandmother, who had served 16 years of her 24-and-a-half-year sentence on a non-violent drug conspiracy conviction. As the pandemic swept through prisons, Levi was released in June 2020 to live in home confinement because of her age, lower risk of reoffending and higher susceptibility to contracting the coronavirus.\nShe was among about 24,000 prisoners released to home confinement after a rigorous vetting process, but Levi briefly returned to federal prison on June 12, after technically violating the terms of her release by not answering a phone call during a pre-scheduled computer word-processing class in the Baltimore Inner Harbor.\nLevi was released on July 6 under an order by Judge Deborah Chasanow of the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland. Yet the Maryland lawmakers wrote to Garland that they “were surprised by the department’s opposition” to giving Levi compassionate release.\n“She played by the rules. She loved her country. She cherishes her faith and because she was not available for a phone call during her class, we find there was an effort by federal authorities to send her back to prison,” Mfume told Capital News Service. “Without any kind of flexibility, we’re going to find situations like this over and over again.”\nMfume added: “Her case is instructive and we talk about it all the time because we believe if we look at that as a barometer, that the Federal Bureau of Prisons will reconstruct the way they carry out their duties with some sort of empathy for individuals, while at the same time making sure the real persons that need to be incarcerated are incarcerated.”\nThe congressman, who represents Baltimore, Baltimore City and Howard Counties, recalled Levi walking into his office shortly after Chasanow’s order released her. She thanked him and the rest of the delegation for helping her.\n“She just in a very humble way, said that she’s so glad that somebody, meaning myself and others here in Maryland, paid attention to her case, because she’d still be where she is,” Mfume said.\nKara Gotsch, deputy director at the Sentencing Project, a Washington-based nonprofit focused on injustices in the criminal justice system, said the Justice Department opinion is “devastating” for those who are staying at home and now face the possibility of being sent back to federal prison.\n“It is really a shame that the White House and DOJ appear to be standing by that OLC memo issued by the Trump administration,” Gotsch told CNS.\nShe’s been in communication with the Biden administration, asking for grants of clemency, an executive privilege for commuting prison time, for everybody who’s been serving sentences in home confinement, but the White House is considering granting it to only some, according to Gotsch.\n“I think that’s a step in the right direction, but there’s no reason why anyone who has proven themselves to be successful on the home confinement program should be sent back,” she added.\nMeanwhile, Rep. David Trone of Gaithersburg has joined with 27 other House Democrats in calling on President Joe Biden to “immediately commute the sentences” of the 4,000 people now in home confinement because of the COVID emergency but facing return to prison after the emergency is ended.\nThe lawmakers also urged the creation of an independent board to review a massive backlog of more than 15,000 petitions seeking clemency.\n“Nearly all of those released have thrived since returning home by reconnecting with their families and communities, and by engaging actively in civic life,” Trone and his colleagues wrote to the president on Sept. 17. “Mr. President, with a stroke of your pen you could remove the threat of reincarceration that looms over thousands of people who have already demonstrated their commitment to being productive members of their communities.”\nTiheba Bain, director of coalitions at the National Council for Incarcerated and Formerly Incarcerated Women and Girls, believes Biden has a chance to show his political support as an advocate for criminal justice reform, a promise he made to Americans during last year’s presidential campaign.\n“We need to come back around and revisit it,” Bain told CNS. “We believe that Biden as a progressive president, in some sense, is the right platform to actually bring more awareness to it.”\nMaryland ranks fifth overall for the highest number of compassionate release petitions filed in any federal district court, according to the U.S. Sentencing Commission’s latest 2020-2021 report. A little more than two-thirds of all motions for compassionate release submitted before the U.S. District Court of Maryland were denied; only 193 petitions were granted out of 564 requests. \n\nGotsch said the home confinement policy is “one of the bright spots” in the federal government’s response to protecting prison inmates from the COVID pandemic.\n“This has been a successful experiment that we should learn from and expand instead of retract,” Gotsch said. “We shouldn’t go back to the way things were. We should learn from this success and build upon it so that we can have a more compassionate, more fair and a safer criminal justice system.”"

    "title": "Facebook needs regulation, experts say, but they see roadblocks",
    "content": "WASHINGTON — Congress should enact regulations to curb harmful practices by social media companies like Facebook, cybersecurity and privacy experts say. But they are skeptical that lawmakers will act and, if they do, whether the pace of policy can parallel the ever-changing technology. \n“It’s clear that some of these companies can’t always do the right thing on their own and need a regulatory stick to help them make better decisions,” Amanda Lenhart, a lead researcher at the Data  Society Research Institute, told Capital News Service.\nLawmakers appear to be moving toward a bipartisan consensus that some form of regulation of Facebook and other social media platforms is needed, especially after Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen revealed last week how her former employer allegedly manipulates its technology to focus on its growth rather than protect users from harmful content.\nFacebook itself is publicly embracing regulation, at least in theory.\n“We need greater transparency, so the systems that we have in place, …they should be held to account, if necessary, by regulation, so that people can match what our systems say they’re supposed to do from what actually happens,” Nick Clegg, Facebook’s vice president of global affairs, said on CNN Sunday. \nBut industry observers say regulating Facebook would be complicated and has potential pitfalls. In any case, such a step would require both technical knowledge that Congress may lack and a drive to overcome inertia, they said.\n“They have been trying to pass comprehensive privacy reform for over five years and it hasn’t happened yet,” said Dr. Jessica Vitak, associate professor at the University of Maryland’s College of Information Studies. \nIn testimony last week before the Senate’s Commerce, Science and Transportation subcommittee on consumer protection, Haugen revealed that Facebook’s leadership is aware of the dangers its platform’s algorithm poses, but said the company is willing to sacrifice users’ safety over profit. \nAn exchange between Sen. Jerry Moran, R-Kansas, and the subcommittee’s chairman, Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Connecticut, underscored bipartisan concerns over the impact Facebook and other social media platforms are having on children and teens.\nMoran suggested the pair should put their differences aside to take on Facebook together.\nBlumenthal responded: “Our differences are very minor, or they seem very minor in the face of the revelations that we have now seen, so I am hoping we can move forward.”\nIn March, Rep. Tom Malinowski, D-New Jersey, re-introduced a bill in the House called “Protecting Americans from Dangerous Algorithms Act.” The legislation would hold social media platforms accountable for content that leads users to harmful behavior offline. Algorithms are computer calculations that platforms use to determine what content users see.  \nSo far, the House has not acted on the measure. \nHaugen repeatedly recommended during her testimony that a federal oversight agency be appointed to regulate tech companies like her former employer, Facebook. \nVitak agreed with Haugen that there are implementable changes that could and should be made related to how technology companies are governed in the U.S. \nA new agency could immediately implement “soft interventions,” such as requiring social media platforms to force users to click on a link before resharing that link, according to Haugen.\nAn oversight committee in Congress, however, could be a problem, warned Dr. Richard Forno, assistant director at the Center for Cybersecurity at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County. Many lawmakers are far behind the learning curve on technology, he said.  \n“You cant have decrepit lawmakers who dont understand the internet and think its this big scary place holding hearings and asking questions as everybody in the room rolls their eyes,” Forno said. “You have congressmen and senators who have never sent emails yet they’re on subcommittees overseeing parts of the internet.”\nWhile some new laws governing social media and minors might be passed by Congress, anything technology-specific is in danger of being outdated, he said. \nThe more realistic options for regulation include creating a new agency that provides oversight or pumping more resources into the Federal Trade Commission, the agency most responsible for protecting consumer privacy, experts said. \n“This is the kind of thing that takes specific industry expertise, it’s the job for a regulatory agency and not a congressional committee,” said Dr. Mark MacCarthy, adjunct professor at Georgetown University and a non-resident senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. \nContinuously updating regulations will be a challenge, said Dr. Joyram Chakraborty, associate professor at Towson University’s Department of Computer and Information Sciences. \n“The policy created will have to be revised within six to nine months because technologies are going to change,” Chakraborty said. \nChildren are not the only ones at risk though, according to Chakraborty.\nAnyone who does not fully understand how to use the technology faces potential harm from social media platforms, he said. \nLenhart has spent much of her career studying young people and their use of technology. \nIf regulations are not created thoughtfully, there will be downstream consequences that aren’t actually beneficial, she told CNS. \nSuch consequences include creating regulatory dead zones, imposing heavy restrictions on tech companies who in turn, refuse to build anything at all, Lenhart said.\nSome critics of social media platforms want Congress to revisit a provision of federal law, known as Section 230, that currently shields social media platforms from liability for content posted by third parties.\n“Most of America doesn’t know about Section 230 and if you pushed a lot of members of Congress, they wouldn’t know either,” Blumenthal said.\nIn March, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg submitted prepared testimony to the House Energy and Commerce Committee’s subcommittee on consumer protection, proposing changes to that provision. \nPlatforms should be required to have “systems in place” for identifying unlawful content but they should not be liable if they miss something, Zuckerberg said. He did not testify in person.\nHaugen told lawmakers that she strongly supports changing Section 230, but she warned reforms must be much broader. \n“The severity of this crisis demands that we break out of our previous regulatory frames,” Haugen said. \nThere might be some momentum in Congress, but it’s counterbalanced by concerns over protecting free speech, said Dr. Anupam Joshi, director at the Center for Cybersecurity at UMBC.\n“On one hand you could argue that large companies like Facebook are sort of getting away with stuff behind Section 230,” Joshi said. “On the other hand, if you repeal it, Facebook is still a behemoth.” \nHaugen tweeted on Monday that she will brief the Facebook Oversight Board on what she learned working at the company.\nThe Oversight Board, consisting of 20 independent experts helping Facebook make content policy decisions, posted on its website that the meeting would take place in the “coming weeks.”"

    "title": "Steny Hoyer and Democrats press Senate to remove Confederate statues",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  Standing in National Statuary Hall in the United States Capitol Building, visitors are taken on a journey through 250 years of American history. While some of the room’s figures, like Rosa Parks and Thomas Edison, exemplify the nation’s diverse and exemplary history, others representing a darker side of the past remain. \nStatues of Confederates and white supremacists in the Hall and elsewhere in the Capitol have not surrendered to widespread public pressure to remove them  even after the House passed legislation in June to do so.\nHouse Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Mechanicsville, is leading a group of Democrats  including Maryland’s Democratic House members  to renew efforts to get the Senate to follow the House.\n“The names and faces of those who championed slavery, sedition, and segregation have no place in this temple of American freedom and democracy,” Hoyer and the other Democrats said in a Sept. 24 letter to Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-New York. “These sacred spaces should be reserved for those we revere: honorable Americans of whose deeds and legacies we can all be proud.”\nWASHINGTON  A bust of Chief Justice Roger Taney, a Maryland native, stands in the old Supreme Court chambers in the United States Capitol. His statue and those of others who either expressed racists views or were associated with the Confederacy are being targeted for removal by Democrats led by House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Mechanicsville. (Photo courtesy of the United States Senate)\nHoyer and 17 other Democrats sponsored the legislation passed by the House to remove the bust of Chief Justice Roger Brooke Taney from the Capitol and replace it with a bust of Associate Justice Thurgood Marshall. The measure also targets 13 other Confederate politicians and soldiers as well as white supremacists.\nThe bill’s co-sponsors included Maryland Democratic Reps. Anthony Brown, D-Upper Marlboro; Kweisi Mfume, D-Baltimore; Jamie Raskin, D-Kensington; Dutch Ruppersberger, D-Timonium; John Sarbanes, D-Towson; and David Trone, D-Gaithersburg. All also were on the letter to Schumer.\nTaney, a Maryland native and former slave owner, wrote the majority opinion in Dred Scott v. Sandford in 1857, contending that blacks, whether they were enslaved or free, could not sue in a court because they were not American citizens; he also said Congress couldn’t free slaves in U.S. territories. \n“The Dred Scott decision was a blot on our history and represents the tragic legacy of slavery and racism that should not be celebrated in our country,” Hoyer said in a statement. “In my home state of Maryland, a statue of Chief Justice Taney was removed from the grounds of the State House, and it’s past time that we follow suit in the U.S. Capitol.”\nEach state is allowed two statues in the Capitol to honor people who have made a significant impact in that state’s and nation’s history. \nBut among the figures immortalized in Statuary Hall is Confederate President Jefferson Davis of Mississippi. His vice president, Alexander Hamilton Stephens of Georgia, is standing nearby. \nA bust of Taney stands in the Capitol’s Old Senate Chamber, later used by the Supreme Court until 1935.\nNot only do these statues symbolize divisive times in U.S. history, but also they stand as barriers to healing racial and political divisions, lawmakers said. \n“On January 6th, we experienced the divisiveness of Confederate battle flags being flown inside the U.S. Capitol,” House Majority Whip James Clyburn, D-South Carolina, said in a statement. “Yet there are still vestiges that remain in this sacred building that glorify people and a movement that embraced that flag and sought to divide and destroy our great country.” \nWASHINGTON  A statue of Confederate Vice President Alexander H. Stephens of Georgia, one of a number of statutes in the United States Capitol Building of Confederates and white supremacists that Democrats are seeking to have removed. (Michael Touma/Capital News Service)\nRemoving the objectionable statues will “demonstrate that as Americans we do not celebrate those who seek to divide us,” Clyburn said. \nHoyer’s bill is part of a host of efforts around the nation, especially in the South, to remove the statues of Confederate and segregationist figures in state capitals and other public spaces. \nThe decision to remove the Taney statue from the Maryland State House “reflects our growth as a state as we have confronted the most difficult parts of our history,” Hoyer said.\nThe Maryland congressman won House passage of his statue bill in July 2020, but it was never considered by the Senate, then controlled by the Republicans. \nThis time around in the House, 218 Democrats and 67 Republicans voted in favor of the bill, while 120 GOP lawmakers voted against it. \n“The House has now advanced our legislation twice,” Hoyer wrote to Schumer. “We would hope that the Senate would now move this legislation. Every moment we delay is a missed opportunity to correct historical wrongs.”\nSchumers office did not respond to a request for comment."

    "title": "Maryland schools eagerly await COVID vaccine OK for kids",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  —  Maryland schools are gearing up for potential Food and Drug Administration emergency use authorization of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine for 5- to 11-year-olds.\nMohammed Choudhury, Maryland state superintendent of schools, told Capital News Service in an email that the vaccine is the best defense against the COVID-19 pandemic.\n“The expansion of vaccine administration to younger children will help prevent school outbreaks, reduce the numbers of students and staff in quarantine, and continue to keep students and staff in classrooms for full-time in-person learning,” he said.\n“Baltimore County Public Schools will be thrilled when vaccines are authorized and available for all students,” spokesman Charles Herndon told CNS. “They are the best way of keeping children and staff in our schools safe and COVID free.”\nPfizer and BioNTech announced Sept. 20 that a smaller dose of their vaccine was safe and had “robust neutralizing antibody responses” among the 5- to 11-year-olds in their trial. \nThe FDA said Friday that it set a vaccines advisory committee for Oct. 26 in anticipation of Pfizer’s request for the vaccine’s authorization.\n“We are eager to extend the protection afforded by the vaccine to this younger population, subject to regulatory authorization, especially as we track the spread of the Delta variant and the substantial threat it poses to children,” Pfizer Chairman and CEO Albert Bourla, said in a statement. \nThe weekly rate of COVID-19 hospitalizations per 100,000 children and adolescents was nearly five times higher in mid-August than in late June, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \nDr. Milagritos D. Tapia, a pediatrics professor at the University of Maryland School of Medicine, said the vaccine “will decrease transmission in schools, and would … decrease the opportunity for children to become severely ill or experience the (after effects) of COVID infections, which do occur in children.” \nThe Maryland Health Department recognizes vaccinations for 5- to 11-year-olds “would be an important peace of mind for parents,” agency spokesman Andrew Owen said in an email to CNS. He added that the department is working with local jurisdictions and school systems to prepare for the vaccine’s approval. \nDana Smith, a parent of an 11-year-old student at Arbutus Middle School in Baltimore County, described the start of the school year as “nerve-wracking with the local positivity rate being up and the community spread bouncing between substantial and high, she told CNS via Facebook Messenger.\nSmith said her heart skips a beat each time the school sends COVID-19 case notifications because she wonders if the students who contracted the virus were in any of her son’s classes.\n“We are looking forward to the vaccine being approved for kids, and I plan to have my son vaccinated as soon as possible,” she said.\nCOVID-19 last month hit elementary schools in the Baltimore County Public Schools system harder than the high schools and middle schools. Nearly half of the 240 positive cases it reported from Sept. 10 to Sept. 17 were from elementary schools, according to the school system. \nTwo weeks later, from Sept. 24 to Oct. 1, the reported positive cases in Baltimore County’s schools weren’t much better. Out of the 214 reported infections, 104 were from elementary schools. \nThe Baltimore County Public Schools system is the third largest in Maryland. Herndon said Baltimore County has a high level of COVID-19 community transmission under CDC criteria.\nHe said having the vaccine authorized for younger children would be a big step toward lowering the school system’s infection rates and making everyone safer.\nHoward County Public School System Superintendent Dr. Michael Martirano said he’s a very strong proponent of younger students being vaccinated, citing their vulnerability to the virus.\nTo keep students and staff safe, the school system engages in constant communication encouraging vaccinations, he said. \n“Keeping this in front of everybody is absolutely critical as we try to maintain the health and well being of our students and staff and keep schools open,” Martirano said. “Thats the main goal.”\nThe Howard County Health Department is working closely with county school officials to determine how to best provide COVID-19 vaccinations for 5- to 11-year-olds once authorization is given, Dr. Kelly Russo, the department’s medical director, said in an email. \nSchool systems across Maryland are making similar preparations ahead of the FDA’s authorization. \nThe Anne Arundel County Public Schools system worked with the local health department during the summer to hold vaccination clinics for students and staff, spokesperson Bob Mosier said in an email. \nRecently, they have been having conversations about the logistics of providing vaccination clinics if and when they become available for 5- to 11-year-olds, he said.\nFrederick County Public Schools Superintendent Dr. Theresa Alban said in an email that the school system and the local health department also are discussing options for offering vaccination clinics.\nThe Baltimore City Public Schools system told CNS in an email that once the vaccine is fully approved, it will continue its partnership with the local health department to ensure vaccines get to students. \nEducation Secretary Miguel Cardona told U.S. News  World Report that it “would be a game changer” for elementary-aged students to be eligible for vaccinations.\nThe anticipated authorization of the vaccine for children comes amid a renewed push from some Maryland lawmakers to mandate vaccinations for public schools statewide.\n“A requirement for students to be able to be vaccinated for Covid as they enter our schools is another tool we should be considering as a state,” state Sen. Clarence Lam, D-Howard and Baltimore counties, said in an interview with CNS. \nGov. Larry Hogan, R, rejected calls for implementing statewide mandates in a press conference on Sept. 30. \n“Because we’ve done so many (vaccinations) we haven’t found the need for it,” he said.\nCalifornia recently announced plans to institute a vaccine mandate in public schools once the FDA fully approves the vaccine for all school-age children, the first state in the country to do so.\nTapia said she recommends Maryland schools encourage families to vaccinate their 5- to 11-year-olds if the FDA authorizes the vaccine for them.\n“I think that there will be concerns, just because there (are) always concerns,” Tapia said.\n“But if theyre concerned, what they should be more concerned about is their risk of having an infection, and the outcomes of that infection for the child, rather than the risk of having side effects from the vaccines,” she said, referring to data from people aged 16-25 having worse reactions to COVID-19 than the vaccines. \n “So it’s a safer bet to be vaccinated than to be infected with COVID,” Tapia said.\n(Capital News Service Annapolis Bureau reporter Alex Argiris contributed to this story.)\n[Like what youre reading?

    "title": "D.C. pro-choice march demands protection for women&#8217;s rights",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  Thousands rallied here Saturday in support of reproductive rights. Speakers warned that after almost five decades, abortions once again could become illegal at the whim of Republican state legislatures or the conservative majority on the Supreme Court. \n“It is our job to turn pain into purpose, to turn pain into promise, and to turn pain into power,” Alexis McGill Johnson, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood, told the rally. “Our humanity and our dignity is not up for debate.”\nThe Washington gathering, called “Rally for Abortion Justice,” was one of more than 650 around the country on Saturday. The rallies were organized by the Womens March and a coalition of nearly 200 groups supporting womens reproductive rights in response to restrictive abortion legislation recently passed in Texas, and another law out of Mississippi that will be heard by the U.S. Supreme Court on December 1. \nWASHINGTON  A demonstrator holds a sign sponsored by the National Organization for Women at Saturdays Rally for Abortion Justice here. (Shauneen Miranda/Capital News Service)\nThe Washington protests were surrounded by what appeared to be a heightened police presence including officers from the Metropolitan Police, U.S. Park Police and United States Capitol Police, as well as security measures around the Supreme Court and the United States Capitol. Nearly nine months ago, the Capitol was the target of a deadly assault by supporters of then-President Donald Trump. \nA small contingent of anti-abortion counter-protesters stood across Pennsylvania Avenue from the pro-choice rally and held their own demonstration, including large posters depicting aborted fetuses. The two groups continually yelled chants at each other.\nRally host Cristela Alonzo, a Texas comedian, denounced her home state’s controversial new law outlawing abortions after six weeks of pregnancy.\n“I love my home state of Texas so much that I am willing to fight for what is best for the people in it.” Referring to the state’s famous slogan “Don’t mess with Texas,” Alonzo said: “But guess what Texas, we’re here because we have to mess with you.”\nA majority of the public supports legalized abortion, according to polls. A Pew Research Center survey conducted in April found 59% of U.S. adults think abortion should be legal in all or most cases; 39% said the procedure should be against the law in all or most cases.\nRally attendees traveled from across the country to participate in the Washington demonstration. Two sisters from Raleigh, North Carolina, Katherine Johnson and Lauren Biggs, came dressed as the late Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Lady Justice, respectively. \nWASHINGTON  Sisters Katherine Johnson and Lauren Biggs, of Raleigh, North Carolina, came to Saturdays reproductive rights demonstration dressed as the late Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Lady Liberty in an act of “performative protest.” (Natalie Drum/Capital News Service)\n“We really like performative protest because we feel like whatever can boost the message is important,” Johnson told Capital News Service. “Because weve been screaming this since 1973, and apparently, certain Supreme Court justices didnt get that memo.”\nMany attendees aired concern over the fate of the landmark Supreme Court case, Roe v. Wade, which in 1973 established a constitutional protection for abortion. \n“I mean, this is systemic, keeping women down, keeping minorities down, it’s a power grab,” said Elizabeth Leek, a 75-year-old grandmother. “And I won’t be surprised if Roe was reversed, unfortunately.”\nWASHINGTON  Elizabeth Leek, a 75-year-old grandmother, shows off her sign at Saturdays Rally for Abortion Justice here. (Brittany N. Gaddy/Capital News Service) \n“People need to come out and let our Congress and our Supreme Court know that we have the right to safe and legal abortions,” rally volunteer Kristen Wesloh said. “And more importantly to make the choices for ourselves as women.”\nAllied groups advocated for and against laws in their own states. A group pressing for statehood for the District of Columbia was there to discuss how the issue affects abortion rights for people in the nation’s capital. \nHeather Booth, a civil rights activist, feminist, and Washington resident, told CNS the capital would have “supported its own abortion justice,” but can’t due to the fact it is not a state.\nWASHINGTON  Heather Booth, a civil rights activist, feminist and Washington resident, speaks with demonstrators at Saturdays Rally for Abortion Justice here. (Natalie Drum/Capital News Service)\n“I am here to support both the freedom for people to make the decision about when and whether to have a child and the freedom for the people of D.C. to have a full right to vote and participate in the democracy,” Booth said. \nMany signs held at the rally noted the additional complications of restrictive laws for trans and gender nonconforming people. \n“I think a lot of times when we talk about abortion and we talk about reproductive rights, trans people and queer and gender nonconforming people typically get left out of the conversation,” demonstrator Bailey Nickoloff said. “My sign is to just kind of remind people: make sure that your activism is inclusive, and that its more than just cis-women who get abortions, more than just cis-women who need reproductive health.” \nWASHINGTON  Bailey Nickoloff highlights the need to include trans rights in the reproductive rights conversation at Saturdays Rally for Abortion Justice here.(Shauneen Miranda/Capital News Service)\nA group called Progressive Anti-Abortion Uprising was one of the counter-protesting groups on the street. \n“We are here to stand up for the fact that all humans and women deserve the right to life and health,” Sonja Morin, one of those with that group, told CNS. “Abortion is false empowerment because it uses violence to achieve that aim.”\nGroups of older women at the pro-choice rally talked about how they remembered the passage of Roe v. Wade and the original battle over reproductive rights. \n“Our generation is really ready to hand the mantle over; we want to help them engage and become active,” said Joanne Collins, an activist with the Indivisible group from Reston, Virginia. “We want to help them with a better future for their position of power. We are helping them usher that in. We are really looking to the younger generation to sort of take over and carry the mantle to keep it going.” \n“We support abortions rights and women’s rights and we feel those rights are under assault,” said Sharon Walters, chairwoman of the Lake Frederick Democrats and Independents in Virginia. “We are not going back. We know what going back looks like, we are not going back.” \n“I just hope young men and women realize what is at stake here and don’t take it for granted.\n[Like what youre reading?

    "title": "With eyes on Texas and Supreme Court, pro-choice advocates to march in D.C. Saturday",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  Advocates for reproductive rights are planning to rally Saturday in the nations capital, a gathering that is expected to put the spotlight on the new anti-abortion law in Texas and a key abortion case that will come before the Supreme Court in December.\n“The goal of this march is to increasingly consolidate our base for the work to come,” Women’s March Executive Director Rachel O’Leary Carmona told Capital News Service. “The theme of the day is rally for abortion justice.”\nThe debate over reproductive rights has been revived by legal challenges to the nearly 50-year-old Supreme Court precedent set by Roe v. Wade, in which the court ruled the right to an abortion is protected under the Constitution. \nSaturday’s rally will not be a traditional Womens March, but rather it is a coalition effort, with more than 660 “sister marches planned the same day around the country, Carmona said. \n“Everything thats happening locally is going to be critically important,” she said.\nIsabel Blalock, the field director of Abortion Access Campaign at NARAL Pro-Choice Maryland, said the organization has been active in planning the Annapolis rally.\n“Im looking forward to seeing what the legislators in the Maryland General Assembly are going to say,” Blalock said. “We are hopeful that theres going to be some really exciting pro-choice and proactive legislation introduced this year in Annapolis.”\nSaturday’s Washington program will begin with a faith gathering, followed by a rally at Freedom Plaza and a march to the U.S. Supreme Court. \nCarmona said there will not be any members of Congress on the stage; however, speakers will include abortion providers and women who will tell their stories about abortions. Busy Philipps, an actress, and Schuyler Bailar, a transgender collegiate swimmer, are scheduled celebrity guest speakers. \nRoxanna Murray, a 58-year-old abortion rights activist, is traveling from Indiana to Washington with members of Women United For Progress Allen County.\n“And were just really excited and looking forward to doing this because we are all determined that women deserve to have equal rights,” she said. “Women should be equal in every way. And that means that we should have total sovereignty over our own bodies.” \nThere all of kinds of reasons why women might need abortions, Murray said, adding that she doesn’t think its ever an easy decision. Regulating that decision and shaming people for it without having any idea why they made it needs to stop, she said.\nBridget McQuate, a freelance writer and a communications specialist at a hospital in West Philadelphia, said in an email to CNS that she recalled when women were considered second-class citizens. \nIt has gotten a lot better, but only “because brave women have come forward to call it out, to name names, and to demand justice and equality,” she said.\nMcQuate, who attended the massive 2017 Women’s March the day after Donald Trump’s inauguration as president, said her 16-year-old daughter is coming with her to the Saturday Washington march because she wants her to know she has to stand up and fight for her rights. \nSaturday’s gathering will be two days after an emotional House Oversight and Reform Committee hearing Thursday on the state of abortion rights in the country. \n“Nearly one in four women in the United States will have an abortion in their lifetime,” Committee Chairwoman, Rep. Carolyn B. Maloney, D-New York, said in her opening statement.  “But with a hostile Supreme Court, extremist state governments are no longer chipping away at our constitutional rights—they are bulldozing right through them.  We must take bold action to protect and expand abortion care rights and access.”\nEarly in the hearing, several congresswomen detailed their own experiences with abortion as they testified in defense of protecting a person’s right to choose. \n“For me, terminating my pregnancy was not an easy choice, but it was my choice,” Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Washington, told the hearing. “And that is what must be preserved, for every pregnant person.” \nAccording to Carmona, Rep. Cori Bush, D-Missouri, and Jayapal, have been sent invitations to attend the event on Saturday.\nOther hearing witnesses discussed the medical, legal and social implications of legislation like the new law in Texas that prohibits abortions six weeks after conception. The law also establishes the right of a private citizen to sue those who may have helped someone obtain an abortion in the state.\nDuring one contentious exchange fueled by legislators, two obstetricians clashed. Dr. Ghazaleh Moayedi, a witness called by pro-choice Democrats, called part of the testimony of Dr. Ingrid Skop, a witness called by anti-abortion Republicans, misinformation after Skop claimed the country keeps poor records on deaths related to abortion. \nFollowing Skop’s comments, Moayedi responded to a question from Rep. Gerry Connolly, D-Virginia, about the reporting of deaths and complications related to abortions, saying, Id like to first remind all OBGYNs that the American Board of OBGYNs has recently warned that spreading medical misinformation can result in loss of board certification.\nAsked for clarification by Connolly as to whether she’d just heard misinformation, Moayedi responded, “I did just hear misinformation.” \nSkop later responded when prompted by Rep. Paul Gosar, R-Arizona: “There is data available to support everything that I have said today,” adding that she believes the politicization of abortion has affected the medical field.  \nIn response to the Texas law, the House narrowly passed the Women’s Health Protection Act last week, attempting to codify the right to abortion services under federal law. The bill is now in the hands of the Senate. \n“It’s really hard because there are some folks  for example, Senators (Joe) Manchin (D-West Virginia) and (Bob) Casey (D-Pennsylvania)  who have said they are not in favor of abortion access,” Carmona said. “Its really challenging when anybody inside of Congress will vote in ways that are not supported by the people.”\nSeparately, the Supreme Court is scheduled on Dec. 1 to hear oral arguments in a case involving a Mississippi law that would ban abortions in the state after the first 15 weeks of pregnancy. That case is Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization. \nIn terms of counter-protesters, Carmona said there are some groups that consistently show up and, “we respect their First Amendment rights to be out in the streets.” \nStudents For Life of America, a social welfare pro-life organization, will hold counter-demonstrations in 24 cities nationwide on Saturday, including in Washington.\n“Telling pro-life women that they aren’t welcome at the Women’s March excludes about half of us from a conversation on what women need to thrive,” SFLA’s Kristan Hawkins said in a statement.\nAnother anti-abortion group, Priests for Life, is scheduled to hold a prayer rally in front of the Supreme Court on Saturday afternoon. The same group has scheduled prayers, a religious service and a vigil at the court on Sunday.\n“In my three decades of full-time national pro-life work, I have always been confident that the pro-life side was winning,” Father Frank Pavone, national director of Priests for Life, said in a statement. “But now I am more convinced than ever that the days of legal abortion in America are numbered.” \nAccording to Carmona, this weekend’s reproductive rights demonstration is not meant to “solve everything.” \n“The opportunity to get more people involved and to be a part of the process of shaping values and shaping public policy is an honor and I am really looking forward to that,” she said.\n[Like what youre reading?

    "title": "Anthony Brown urges Pentagon to root out extremism in ranks",
    "content": "WASHINGTON — A Maryland lawmaker on the House Armed Services Committee is criticizing the Biden administration’s opposition to his efforts to pressure the Pentagon into addressing domestic extremism in the armed forces.\nRep. Anthony Brown, D-Upper Marlboro, inserted an amendment into a House-passed defense spending plan that would direct defense officials to more closely monitor extremist activity in the military and give the secretary of defense the authority to remove from service those involved in extremist groups. The White House, however, opposed the amendment as too onerous.\nThat prompted Brown to air his frustrations publicly Wednesday to Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Gen. Mark Milley at an armed services panel hearing.\n“Whether its sexual assault or racial injustice, the Department repeatedly tells Congress, ‘we can handle it, commanders are responsible, we’re studying it, we’re ready to fight tonight,’” Brown said. “We cannot wait years, let alone decades, in the face of obeisance from the Department before meeting the challenges of extremism in the Armed Forces. The time to address it is now.” \nBrown, a retired colonel in the Army Reserve who served in Iraq and a former member of the Army’s Judge Advocate General’s Corps, acknowledged that Austin and Milley recognized the threat of domestic extremism among troops, “but I’m gravely concerned that too many of our military leaders do not.”\n“For decades, we’ve grappled with extremist ideologies within our own ranks, here at home,” Brown said. “And there are no signs that we’re winning this fightPlease stop fighting Congress.”\nThe lawmaker pointed out that 12% of those charged with offenses related to the deadly Jan. 6 attack on the United States Capitol had military experience.\nBrown’s measure establishes an Office of Countering Extremism to develop and implement training and other resources aimed at “identifying, preventing, responding to, reporting, and mitigating the risk of extremism” for each military branch.\nBut the White House on Sept. 21 issued a policy statement opposing Brown’s amendment.\n“The administration shares the goal of preventing prohibited extremist activities and holding offenders accountable, but opposes (the Brown amendment) because it would impose onerous and overly specific training and data collection requirements and would foreclose other options to address extremism,” the statement said.\nBrown believes the armed forces is “an attractive institution” for recruiting active or retired service members by extremist groups.\n“We know there’s a problem in the military,” Brown told Capital News Service in an interview. “As long as there’s extremism in American society, the military will be susceptible to this sort of recruitment and infiltration.”\nWhile Austin and Milley did not respond to Brown’s statement at the armed services hearing, both previously have discussed the threat of extremism inside the military.\nA December report from the Defense Department’s Board on Diversity and Inclusion warned that “younger adults could be particularly vulnerable to groups that promote extremist views that run counter to the military’s mission.”\n“Examining extremist organizations’ recruitment tactics and Service member radicalization can help DoD in halting these behaviors,” the report said.\n“You’re telling me with an additional $25 billion that a little bit of training and a little bit of disclosure on extremism in the military is too expensive or too costly or too burdensome, then we need to reconsider how you’re using your resources,” Brown told CNS before Wednesday’s hearing. “We know it’s a real threat, they’ve acknowledged it as a threat and America saw it on full display during the insurrection on January 6th.”\n[Like what youre reading?

    "title": "Companies look to hire Afghan refugees, but child care remains a question",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  As a number of top American companies are promising to train or hire Afghan refugees resettling in the United States, questions remain about providing child-care services to the new workers.\nThe infusion of new talent should help offset nationwide labor shortages, said Krish O’Mara Vignarajah, president and CEO of Baltimore-based Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Services.\n“These refugees are such vital contributors to our economy and workforce,” Vignarajah said to CNS. “Just because these people have been persecuted doesn’t mean they aren’t coming with valuable skills.”\nMaryland is slated to receive 1,348 refugees recently evacuated from Afghanistan, according to government statistics first reported by The Associated Press.\nThe odds of those refugees finding work are good: 61 percent of those in Maryland using employment services landed jobs in 2020, according to the Maryland Office for Refugees and Asylees. The state is ranked eleventh in employment outcomes for refugees nationwide.\nBut child care is absolutely going to be essential, said Alan Khazei, senior advisor at Welcome.US, a national coalition to welcome and support the incoming Afghan refugees through employment opportunities.\nAfghan families are very large, said Freshta Taeb, a board member of the Afghan American Foundation and senior refugee interventionist for Cornerstone family and marriage intervention, a faith-based counseling organization.\n“The biggest help any organization can have when hiring women is going to be the option of childcare,” said Taeb, who has been working with Afghan refugees at Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst in New Jersey, one of the primary entry points for Afghan refugees coming to the United States.\nIn July, The Economist evaluated countries with the most generous child-care policies, including leave, access, quality and affordability. America ranked number 40 out of 41 countries on the list.\nChild care is an issue Welcome.US is trying to work on, Khazei said. However, he admitted that providing and funding child care will largely depend on volunteers stepping up and helping out, he said.\n“We haven’t had this many refugees arriving all at once since the end of the Vietnam War, so it’s a huge challenge,” Khazei said.\nIn addition to companies and nonprofits, 16 governors joined Welcome.US, including Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan and Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam.\n“Our state is proud to be the fourth state in the nation for the resettlement of SIV recipients,” Governor Larry Hogan said during the livestream launch of Welcome.US on Sept. 14.\nA 2018 Migration Policy Institute report revealed early childhood services for young refugee children are a low-priority issue and are often overlooked by both state and federal agencies, policymakers and departments responsible for refugee resettlement and integration.\nThe majority of the $6.3 billion in emergency funds the Biden administration received from Congress to help Afghan refugees will go to the Defense and and State Departments to support processing sites and transportation to and from those sites, Shalanda Young, acting director of the White House’s Office of Management and Budget, wrote in a blog post.\nAdditional funds will go to health screenings, vaccinations and resettlement resources, Young said. Taeb said she has not seen Afghan refugee families coming to the base with fewer than six, seven or eight children.\nMany of the women Taeb is seeing and interacting with on the base are pregnant, she said, adding that there have been over a dozen babies born so far at the New Jersey installation.\nWorking married mothers in the United States often reduce work hours, take pay cuts or drop out of the workforce altogether so that they can take care of their children, according to a 2021 study by the U.S. Census bureau.\nMaryland’s refugee office has served 465 newly-arrived eligible Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) applicants as of August 2021. The Special Immigrant Visa program is one of many programs authorizing Afghan refugees to resettle in the United States.\nAs of 2020, a report from Brown University’s Watson Institute said, over 18,000 Afghan applicants had received American government visas, along with over 45,000 of their immediate family members, and had immigrated to the United States.\nApplicants for SIVs must meet certain requirements like working for or with the U.S. government in some capacity.\nBetween Oct. 1, 2020, and the end of last month, 330 Afghan SIV’s arrived in Maryland, according to data from the Refugee Processing Center, a case management system processing refugees in the United States.\nMost women in Afghanistan are not eligible for the SIV program, said Devon Cone, a senior advocate for women and girls at Refugees International.\nCone said women have a hard time qualifying as primary SIV applicants because they had limited access to education and, even if able to work with the U.S. military, would have faced much higher personal risks in Afghanistan simply because they were women.\nHowever, there are some Afghan women who have come to the United States through the SIV program but will face other challenges.\nDeterrents around child care and transportation made it difficult for Afghan and Iraqi female Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) spouses to attend classes or employment, according to a 2018 report by the U.S. Government Accountability Office, the nonpartisan auditing arm of Congress.\nFemale SIV spouses who wanted to work felt they needed to wait until their children were older or needed to learn the English language first, the GAO said.\nAmong other programs, child care and language adaptation are vital to the integration of refugees in the work environment, according to 2019 documents released by the International Chamber of Commerce.\nThe United States Chamber of Commerce Foundation earlier this month launched a coalition to help Afghan refugees find employment in the United States. The coalition also joined the Welcome.US campaign working with companies like UPS, Amazon and Walmart to offer assistance to Afghan refugees.\n“We know what a job means to an individual and to a community. It means dignity, opportunity, stability and hope for a better future, Carolyn Cawley, president of the chambers foundation, said in a statement.\nTo ensure that their new workers stay employed, companies need to understand what skills Afghan refugees already possess and learn about Afghan culture, Taeb said.\nAnother challenge will be helping refugees adjust to American culture, Taeb said.\n“If employees are not culturally competent or not aware of certain dynamics, you cant expect someone from a different culture to come and assimilate overnight,” Taeb said.\n[Like what youre reading?

    "title": "As Congress debates legalizing marijuana, youth use is up",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  As congressional Democrats press for federal legalization of marijuana and more states continue to legalize it, an increasing number of college-age adults across the United States are ditching liquor stores and heading to dispensaries, a new study shows.\nRoughly 44% of college students consumed marijuana in 2020, a jump from 38% in 2015, according to a July survey by the University of Michigan’s Institute for Social Research and sponsored by the National Institute on Drug Abuse at the National Institutes of Health.\nThe survey, which has been tracking alcohol and drug consumption of Americans aged 19-60 since 1980, questioned nearly 1,600 young adults aged 19-22 from March to November of 2020. This age range showed the greatest changes in cannabis and alcohol use of all the groups studied.\nBy contrast, among 45-60 year olds, 10-12% reported marijuana use in 2020, a decrease from 12-15% in 2015.\n“There may be multiple reasons for these findings, including increased social acceptance of marijuana use and decreased criminal justice-related treatment admissions,” Nora Volkow, director of NIDA, told Capital News Service. “Additional research is required to build an evidence base and untangle the multiple factors that affect cannabis use outcomes.”\nThe increase in marijuana use among young Americans coincided with a decrease in alcohol consumption. Fifty-six percent of the study’s subjects reported drinking alcohol in 2020, compared to 62% the year before.\nLikewise, binge-drinking hit an all-time low in the most recent study, dipping eight points in a year to 24%.\n“While binge-drinking has been gradually declining among college students for the past few decades, this is a new historic low,” Dr. John Schulenberg, a University of Michigan psychology professor and one of the study’s authors, said in a statement.\nThe trend toward higher marijuana consumption comes at a time when the legalization of the drug is accelerating among the states: voters in Arizona, Montana, South Dakota and New Jersey approved marijuana legalization measures in the 2020 elections. In total, 33 states  including Maryland  plus the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, have legalized marijuana for medicinal use. A total of 19 states and the District of Columbia also have legalized marijuana for recreational use.\nOn the federal level, three Democratic senators want to legalize cannabis nationwide. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York, and Sens. Ron Wyden of Oregon and Cory Booker of New Jersey, co-sponsored a bill they introduced in July to do just that.\n“Cannabis prohibition, a key pillar of the failed War on Drugs, has caused substantial harm to our communities and small businesses, and especially for communities of color,” Wyden said in a statement. “It’s as simple as this: Senators Booker, Schumer and I want to bring common sense to the federal government, end prohibition and restore the lives of those hurt most and set them up for opportunity.”\nThe lawmakers’ bill, called the Cannabis Administration and Opportunity Act, would remove cannabis from the Controlled Substances Act and would give states the right to regulate the drug as they now regulate alcohol.\n“Not only will this legislation remove cannabis from the federal list of controlled substances,” Schumer said in a statement. “But it will also help fix our criminal justice system, ensure restorative justice, protect public health, and implement responsible taxes and regulations.”\nThe House in December passed legislation decriminalizing marijuana, but the measure died in the Senate. Rep. Jerry Nadler, D-New York, and five other House Democrats reintroduced the bill in May. Nadler is chairman of the House Judiciary Committee.\nPointing to state legalization efforts, Nadler said: “Our federal laws must keep up with this pace.”\nBut opponents insist cannabis use shouldn’t be encouraged by the government.\n“Drug use is an epidemic in this country,” Scott Chipman, vice president of Americans Against Legalizing Marijuana, told CNS. “We need to ask why and address the underlying causes. Certainly, normalizing drug use and commercializing marijuana exacerbates the drug use epidemic.”\nThe University of Michigan survey found that cannabis use was highest in states in the West and Northeast. Fourteen of the 20 states in those two regions have legalized the drug for recreational use.\n“Often, as humans, we want to do things that we perceive to be normative – to have our actions perceived as positive and normal within our social groups and society,” Volkow said. “So, as drugs like marijuana… are advertised to have potential therapeutic effects and are perceived as socially acceptable, that may lead people to be more likely to want to take them.”\nThe nation’s attitude towards marijuana the drug has become more favorable in recent years.\nA November 2020 Gallup poll showed that 68% of Americans support marijuana legalization, including almost half of Republicans.\n“For decades, our federal government has waged a War on Drugs that has unfairly impacted low-income communities and communities of color,” Booker said in a statement. “While red and blue states across the country continue to legalize marijuana, the federal government continues to lag woefully behind. It is time for Congress to end the federal marijuana prohibition and reinvest in communities most impacted by the failed War on Drugs.”\n[Like what youre reading?

    "title": "Biden’s 9/11 declassification order renews debate over secrecy vs. transparency",
    "content": "WASHINGTON — Two decades after the terrorist attacks, the White House’s new executive order to declassify confidential documents regarding Sept. 11, 2001, underscores the government’s propensity to keep secrets long after they are useful, according to some intelligence experts.\n“It is frustrating because it shouldn’t have been necessary to issue this order,” Steven Aftergood, director of the Project on Government Secrecy at the Federation of American Scientists, told Capital News Service.\nTwelve years ago, then-President Barack Obama issued Executive Order 13526, requiring that “information shall be declassified as soon as it no longer meets the standards for classification under this order.”\nOn Sept. 3, President Joe Biden signed an executive order directing federal agencies under the jurisdiction of the executive branch to exclusively review Sept. 11 records that can be declassified within six months.\nBiden said he “made a commitment to ensuring transparency” in the wake of the terror attacks, one he’s now honoring, according to a statement. But Aftergood says otherwise, suggesting the new executive order is too limited in scope, compared to the Obama-era mandate.\n“If this order was going to be issued, then it should have been bolder in its requirements,” he added.\nCongress has been grappling with the overclassification of documents for decades and the pandemic made that problem significantly worse. Mark Bradley, director of the Information Security Oversight Office in the National Archives and Records Administration issued a stern warning in its 2020 annual report to the president.\n“The pandemic adversely affected every aspect of our Classified National Security Information and Controlled Unclassified Information systems,” Bradley wrote. “It shuttered buildings, limited or prevented access to classified networks, forced many federal workers to telework or work remotely, delayed the modernization and deployment of badly needed technological updates, crippled oversight efforts, and dramatically slowed the declassification of historically important records, increasing an ever-expanding backlog.”\nDavid Priess, a former CIA intelligence officer during the administrations of Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, said national intelligence agencies are “perennially underfunded and under-resourced,” which delays their ability to process and produce classified records for public release.\n“The whole point of these documents on 9/11 coming out is, if we’re going to do it, we need to do it without redactions, because that’s kind of the point,” Priess added.\nJeremy Bash, a former CIA chief of staff and Defense Department in the Obama administration, told CNS there “are always delicate balances to strike” in declassifying aging documents.\n“But I think we should err as much as possible on the side of transparency,” Bash said. “I’m confident that if the president, after consulting with the relevant agencies, determines that we can protect sources and methods, I’m confident that declassifying information about 9/11 is in the public interest and will not compromise national security.”\nEven though the 9/11 Commission Report — published with many redacted pages in 2004 — was created at the direction of Congress, it’s now technically in the possession of NARA, an independent executive branch agency whose origins date back to 1934.\n“A large percentage” of an estimated 570 cubic feet of the commission’s supporting records remain classified for national security reasons, even though some were opened in January 2009, according to the agency.\nIn an explanation to Capital News Service, the National Archives said it is exempt from Biden’s executive order. Only documents used in court cases and records from PENTTBOM, the codename for the FBI’s probe on 9/11, are being reviewed for declassification, according to the Archives’ interpretation of the new order. \nYet anyone may still be able to file mandatory declassification review requests for 9/11 Commission records through the Center for Legislative Archives, even though the agency lacks legal authority to actually release them.\nLast November, the Interagency Security Classification Appeals Panel, a presidential appellate panel composed of representatives from federal intelligence agencies that oversees appeals for mandatory declassification, released 26 documents created by the 9/11 Commission.\nSens. Chris Murphy, D-Connecticut, and Ron Wyden, D-Oregon, are seeking to depoliticize classified information by creating congressional accountability and oversight of ISCAP through the reintroduction of the Transparency in Classification Act, a bill that had languished in the previous Congress.\nMurphy, who sits on the Senate’s Foreign Relations Committee’s Near East, South Asia, Central Asia, and Counterterrorism subcommittee, believes “overclassification for political purposes undermines Congress’s ability to hold the executive branch accountable and unnecessarily keeps the American public in the dark.”\n“Regardless of the administration, protecting the integrity of the classification system is a matter of national security—not politics,” Murphy said in a statement. “We’ve seen the serious harm that politicization of intelligence can cause, and our legislation restores congressional oversight and supports President Biden as he works to unravel the damage done by his predecessor.”\nAlthough the FBI already released a 16-page memo from August 2016 on Sept. 11 — the first of its kind since the new executive order was enacted — Aftergood said he wanted to “see something more ambitious.” \nHe would like to see “drop dead” dates established for sensitive documents: classified designations on any records exceeding 40 years in age would expire and be subject to immediate declassification.\nAftergood said the Biden executive order should have explicitly stated that all 9/11 documents are to be declassified — except in cases where methods or sources are susceptible to being compromised.\nImplementing a definitive “drop dead” date would “free up a lot of bureaucratic resources,” Aftergood insisted, allowing agencies to review more complicated documents instead.\nIncredibly, federal agencies still conduct most declassification reviews by hand, according to the Public Interest Declassification Board, created by Congress to advise the executive branch on policies regarding the handling of national security information.\nThe board issued a report last year recommending ways the nation’s classification and declassification of documents can be conducted more efficiently.\n“Transformation will be difficult,” board Chair Trevor W. Morrison and Acting Chair James E. Baker wrote in their transmittal letter to then-President Donald Trump. “When it comes to declassification, the government is still in the analog age.”\n“The current system was created before the United States entered World War II, and it remains entrenched today,” Morrison and Baker said. “Despite rapid increases in the volume and variety of digital data, the government still relies upon inefficient and ineffective paper-based processes.”\nThe federal government is woefully ill-prepared for classifying and declassifying digital information, the board warned.\nThe Information Security Oversight Office estimated that the government spent $18.4 billion on its security programs in fiscal 2017. Just $102 million of that was spent on declassification of information.\nPriess believes all of the power still lies with the president to make the final call on what becomes public and what stays secret.\nHe asked: “Is there a president who is willing to say, ‘You know what, the historical value of these documents and the need to be open and transparent overrides any remaining national security concerns?’”\n“9/11 is the core issue here but declassification is a problem that extends across the executive branch,” Aftergood said. “It needs some focused attention, if we’re going to ever get it right.”\n[Like what youre reading?

Provisional data from the CDC shows national suicide deaths actually decreased by 5.6% from 2019 to 2020. While the decrease in completed suicides holds true for the state of Maryland, emergency department visits for suicide attempts and suicidal thoughts have increased during the pandemic.\nSeptember is National Suicide Prevention Month.\n“We know that suicide risk has increased, even if suicide death has not shown increases on the general population,” Dr. Jodi Frey, professor at the University of Maryland’s School of Social Work, told Capital News Service. “So what that tells me as a researcher, and previously as a practitioner, is I don't need to wait for data to show me that deaths are increasing. If I know risks are increasing, we need to act now.”\nIn Maryland, 9,837 individuals went to emergency departments for suicide attempts and thoughts of suicide in the first half of this year, compared to 9,200 individuals during the same period in 2019, according to the state Department of Health.\nThe number of people using the state’s public behavioral health system (which includes services like therapy) is down for 2021 compared to the 2019 figures so far, according to Dr. Aliya Jones, Maryland Department of Health’s Deputy Secretary of Behavioral Health Administration.\n“And that can certainly translate into people having more behavioral health crises” that require emergency care, Jones said. “People are clearly in distress, and are utilizing crisis services more than they have before.”\nAmid increases in emergency care for suicide attempts and suicidal thoughts, state health officials also have noted a decrease in patients at psychiatric hospitals during the pandemic.\n“I think that the decreases on the inpatient side may just represent that people are possibly staying in the hospital longer than they were before because it's harder to move people back into the community, particularly if you're moving them into residential environments because of the concerns about COVID,” Jones said. “COVID status makes it difficult.”\nShe also noted a possible decrease in available inpatient psychiatric beds, as some may have been commandeered to serve COVID patients during the pandemic.\nAccording to Frey, assessment and response to suicide risk has also been improving over the last few years. She said hospitals have been using screening tools and other assessments to provide the least-restrictive plans for people struggling with suicidal thoughts.\n“Going to the emergency room is usually not helpful to someone who has suicide ideation. And in fact, research shows us that it can be harmful,” Frey said. “So we really think about, as suicideologists, the emergency department and inpatient care, as a last resort, and try to think about what coping and supports a person has in their family and community so that they can receive care without necessarily going inpatient.”\nWhile the impact of the pandemic on overall mental health and suicide risk is being documented, suicide has no sole cause.\n“Suicide happens when multiple stressors, multiple health issues and other risk factors converge,” said Meredith Glaze, loss and healing chair of the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention National Capital Area Chapter. “And that's what creates that sense of hopelessness, a sense of despair, that may eventually lead to someone to die by suicide.”\nRisk and protective factors for suicide provided by the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention. For more information visit the AFSP website (Jenna Cohen/Capital News Service).\nThe Maryland Department of Health has noted that the largest numbers of people seeking emergency care for suicidal thoughts and attempts during the pandemic were those under 17 and people between the ages of 35 and 54.\nJones attributed the younger group seeking emergency care at least partially to the impact of not being in school, where students can often receive behavioral health resources and social support. She added that kids re-entering schools may help bring those numbers back down to more traditional metrics.\nOther demographic populations have experienced disproportionate increases in suicide risk during the pandemic as well.\n“When you talk about suicide and suicide prevention, I think it's important for us to recognize that we were already functioning in a very stressed, and what I would probably consider a broken, mental health system,” Frey said. “Meaning that a lot of people, particularly those in more vulnerable groups, that are at higher risk now for suicide due to COVID implications.”\nFrey specifically noted that exceptional stress is affecting essential workers, those experiencing job loss or unstable employment or housing, and people of color.\n“Particularly in Maryland, we've seen research over the past year and a half showing that suicide rates for Black Americans have increased, where some of the rates throughout the country have actually decreased for suicide death,” Frey said.\nSuicide ranks 11th among leading causes of death in the United States, with COVID-19 currently 3rd after joining the list last year, according to The Journal of the American Medical Association.\nGlaze said there are ways to spot and help those in crisis: be mindful of other people, pay attention to warning signs such as someone talking about suicide or showing big changes in behavior, have honest conversations about any concerns and provide resources such as the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline.\nLooking ahead, Frey says she’d like to see an investment of funds in training for mental health professionals, as well as support to allow graduates the opportunity to do triage and therapy as they work on getting licensed.\n“It was critical before COVID, and now it's a crisis,” Frey said.\nLong-term, Frey said, it’s also necessary to re-assess the overall mental healthcare system and insurance policies related to mental health. She said finding ways to expand the workforce and make sure providers are paid and encouraged to stay in the system could help more vulnerable populations receive care.\n“Mental health care should be a right, not a privilege,” Frey said. “And right now, I think for a lot of people, it's a privilege that's not affordable.”\nIf you are struggling with thoughts of suicide, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1(800)273-8255 or visit its website at https://suicidepreventionlifeline.org/. The Lifeline offers 24/7, free and confidential support."

    "title": "Historically shortchanged, tribes would get conservation aid under bipartisan bill",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  The Walker River Paiute Tribe, located in Schurz, Nevada, is not bear country. But because of the wildfires ravaging California, these animals are escaping to new and safer habitats, some of which lie within Native American territory.\nThe federal government historically has given comparatively little conservation funding to tribal lands, so suddenly having to deal with an influx of animals like bears means Indigenous people have to make do with little or no resources. \n“Fish and wildlife, they dont know the boundary lines,” Elveda Martinez, president of the Native American Fish and Wildlife Society and member of the Walker River Paiute Tribe, told Capital News Service. “That bear thats down here in our community, he didnt stop at the reservation boundary and say, ‘Oh, I cant go on that. I cant go on that reservation because they dont have any funding to deal with me. They have no funding to track me. They have no way to save me.’”\nThat may change. \nThe Recovering America’s Wildlife Act, introduced in April by Reps. Debbie Dingell, D-Michigan, and Jeff Fortenberry, R-Nebraska, includes the aid that Indigenous people have been seeking for decades.\nThe bill redirects $1.3 billion of existing revenue to state-led wildlife conservation efforts, as well as $97.5 million to tribal-led efforts. \nTribal lands provide habitat for over 525 federally-listed threatened and endangered species across nearly 140 million acres of land, many of which have great cultural significance to Native American tribes. \nMartinez’s bear problem is just a blip on a wide radar of conservation-related problems that her tribe is left to solve with minimal resources. \nUnder the Pittman-Robertson Wildlife Restoration Act, which dates to 1937, states and territories are allocated funds for restoration and conservation efforts annually. According to the Congressional Research Service, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service disbursed nearly $19 billion dollars to states and territories between 1939 and 2019. Other than a small number of grants, no other conservation money was given to tribal lands. \n“Right now, theres really no funding for tribal fish and wildlife out there,” Martinez said. “Theres no funding for tribes to build capacity for those different issues. Right now, the Tribes, we all fight over $4 to $6 million for tribal wildlife grants that come through the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.” \nLike the 50 states, all 574 federally-recognized Native American tribes in the United States are unique. Some, like the Navajo Nation, have millions of acres of land, while others do not have any territory at all.\n​​”The needs are just as diverse as the Tribes themselves,” Julie Thorstenson, executive director of the Native American Fish and Wildlife Society, said. “Sometimes I see them using (funds) to continue the work that theyre already doing, maybe to expand into research or build capacity. And other tribes, it might mean just getting started developing their fish and wildlife programs.”\nThe grants given to tribes by the federal government have primarily gone to tackling immediate needs, but do not have enough substance to leave a lasting impact, according to tribal leaders.\n“Theres just not enough money,” Martinez said. “And then again, if you get a grant, you might be able to do a little project. But once that grant is over, its like, ‘Okay, now, what do I do now?’”\nThe Dingell-Fortenberry legislation has gained momentum since it was introduced, drawing support from both sides of the aisle and backing from numerous nonprofit organizations. \n“RAWA is the single most exciting public policy development in conservation in decades,” Rep. Fortenberry said in a press release. “It protects ecosystems, enhances community, supports recreation. It’s why we have a diverse group of persons, from across the political spectrum–– sportsmen, hunters, anglers, birdwatchers ––aligned so beautifully around this bill.”\n“There’s been a real kind of evolution or revitalization over the last five or six years,” said Garrit Voggesser, tribal partnership director for the National Wildlife Federation. “Tribes have really raised their voices about their rights… as communities and cultures to be negatively impacted by development, and also to have the opportunities to protect their connection with the land and wildlife.”\nEfforts to provide conservation aid to tribes come as those tribes also struggle, like the rest of the planet, with climate change.\n“Our people are called the trout eaters, we’re the Agai-Dicutta,” Martinez said. “But were losing our culture because theres no trout in our lake….Its because of climate change.”\nFunding to address climate issues on Martinez’s reservation, as well as on others around the United States, is included in a massive Democratic reconciliation package.\nWithin the $25.6 billion for climate funding, $6.3 billion is earmarked for tribal lands. At the moment, prospects for the reconciliation measure are unclear. \nNative Americans across the United States are watching the Congress closely to see what happens to the conservation and wildlife aid bill.\n“If it doesnt (pass), I think tribes will muster strength and we’ll figure out how to take another crack at it,” Voggesser said. “The majority of tribes will continue to move forward. But dealing with what’s happening to wildlife and habitat, primarily because of climate, but also human development, it’s going to become more challenging if there arent additional resources to address protection of wildlife and habitat.”"

    "title": "Law Enforcement Museum honors police lost on 9/11 in special exhibit",
    "content": "WASHINGTON — The 72 law enforcement officers who were among the victims of the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks are being honored at a new, 2,000-square-foot exhibit at the National Law Enforcement Museum.\nAfter recently reopening after being shuttered by the coronavirus pandemic, the museum has mounted a new addition: “Post 9/11: The Evolution of American Law Enforcement.”\nIn addition to the 72 who died in the attacks 20 years ago, the exhibit also recognizes an additional 300 officers who were on duty that day and have died over the years since then.\nThe exhibit aligns with the nonprofit’s mission to “tell the story of American law enforcement,” said Thomas Canavan, executive director of the museum.\nWASHINGTON- Seventy-two law enforcement officers died during the Sept. 11 attacks — another 300 have passed away since then — all of whom are honored with photographed tags on a chain-linked fence within the new exhibit. (Gabriel Pietrorazio/Capital News Service)\n“Even within just this exhibition, when you look at the role of Congress, and the Patriot Act, creating Homeland Security, and then moving through technology and innovation, community engagement, training and preparation and information sharing, you’ll start to realize the scope and the magnitude of keeping us all safe,” Canavan told Capital News Service.\nThe entrance to the DuPont Gallery is flanked with a 2,200-pound steel beam salvaged from one of the destroyed twin towers of New York’s World Trade Center and a 6,300-pound concrete block from the Pentagon.\nA panel of academic and professional experts assembled virtually on Aug. 19, offering thoughtful last-minute contributions for curators ahead of the exhibit’s unveiling on Aug. 27.\n“I think you can’t really understand the post-9/11 period unless you understand the trauma and the fear that the event created,” said David H. Schanzer, a Duke University professor at the Sanford School of Public Policy and director of the Triangle Center on Terrorism and Homeland Security.\nSchanzer, with Michael Burns, a design director at Quatrefoil Associations, and Josh Feinberg, principal of JAF Consulting, started creating the exhibit’s educational content and physical fabrication — just a few months before the beginning of 2021 — ahead of the highly-anticipated anniversary.\nFeinberg said he initially grappled with developing an exhibit meant to “memorialize and teach” at the same time without emotionally overwhelming visitors. He added that what was created is “not really an exhibit about 9/11” but rather an avenue to explore technological advancements within the profession of policing.\nWASHINGTON  Thomas Canavan, executive director of the National Law Enforcement Museum, believes it’s still important to remember the lives of law enforcement personnel that were lost 20 years ago. (Gabriel Pietrorazio/Capital News Service)\nLaw enforcement is facing numerous controversies, most notably multiple incidents in which people of color have died at the hands of police under questionable circumstances  and in some cases have led to prosecutions of officers. As a consequence, racial justice advocates and state and federal lawmakers have pressed for broad reforms in policing.\n“Obviously, issues about law enforcement are in the public debate,” Feinberg admitted. “While we weren’t addressing those issues directly in the exhibition, there are certain resonances”\nTwo of Canavan’s great-grandfathers and his wife’s great-grandfather were all police officers at one point. (Canavan holds an undergraduate degree in art from the University of Maryland and a master’s in arts administration from Boston University.)\nCanavan said the museum is focused on bridging the divide between police and the communities they’re supposed to protect.\n“I think at the end of the day, it’s about us helping bring law enforcement communities together and using this museum as a platform to teach the community more about law enforcement,” he said.\nEditors Note: The National Law Enforcement Museum is open Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays and free admission is available to active and former law enforcement officers through Sept. 30. The exhibit is scheduled to run until July 31, 2022."

    "title": "With pandemic benefits ending, Maryland and U.S. poverty rates could rise",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  Despite the American Rescue Plan and other emergency measures that one study says is keeping an estimated 729,000 Marylanders out of poverty this year, the cutoff of extended unemployment and other benefits could trigger a reverse effect. \nThe coronavirus pandemic brought a new wave of financial hardships for families across the United States, including Maryland.\nFederal initiatives sought to combat these financial challenges and reduce poverty, but the temporary nature of these efforts raises questions about whether the estimated decrease in poverty also will be temporary, according to experts. \nThe percentage of people living below the poverty line fell last year as a result of federal relief programs, according to data released from the U.S. Census Bureau Tuesday. \nThe Census Bureau found that stimulus payments enacted in response to the pandemic took 11.7 million people out of poverty, which is defined as income below $26,200 each year for a four-person family.\nExpanded unemployment insurance benefits in 2020 also had an impact –– keeping 5.5 million individuals from facing poverty, according to the Census Bureau. \nA report from the Joint Economic Committee in Congress used the Urban Institute’s projections on national and state poverty levels in 2021 to assess the impact of the American Rescue Plan and traditional safety net programs seeking to help individuals during the pandemic. \nThe Washington-based think tank, which focuses on social and economic policy, projected that Marylands poverty has decreased 66.3 percent this year as a result of these combined initiatives.\nPrior to the measures put in place, the Urban Institute estimated that Maryland had an 18.6 percent poverty rate. The combination of benefit programs led to a projected 6.3 percent poverty rate in the state, which translates to keeping an estimated 729,000 Marylanders out of poverty. \nThis year’s poverty rate projections in the United States fell significantly below 2018’s estimates, according to the Urban Institute. \nUsing the same methods, the annual poverty rate projections nationwide dropped from 13.9 percent to 7.7. percent between 2018 and 2021. \nBut the extension of unemployment benefits under the American Rescue Plan ended on Sept. 6, a decision that could influence the projected poverty numbers for Maryland and the rest of the nation. \nThe extended benefits gave people unemployment payments beyond the normal number of weeks they would be entitled to in Maryland.\nThe benefits also offered $300 weekly in addition to the standard $400, according to Kali Schumitz, director of communications and partner engagement at the Maryland Center on Economic Policy, a nonprofit research organization. \n“We definitely would expect the expanded unemployment ending to have some kind of impact,” Schumitz said.\n“Because it just happened, we don’t know exactly what the impact of that is going to be, but we do know that most people who are still receiving unemployment assistance payments in Maryland were on those extended benefits programs,” she said. \nPresident Joe Biden’s American Rescue Plan, signed into law in March, sought to alleviate hardships during the pandemic and offer assistance to working families. \nThe $1.9 trillion package included direct payments, increases in tax credits, an extension of unemployment insurance and small business relief, according to the White House’s official website.  \nRep. David Trone, D-Gaithersburg, a member of the Joint Economic Committee, played a role in the passage of the Biden package.\n“As the Joint Economic Committee’s report shows, the American Rescue Plan was crucial to reducing projected poverty rates in Maryland and across the country during this public health crisis,” Trone told Capital News Service.\nMaryland’s projected poverty numbers for this year, although county rates vary considerably, remain lower than many other states, such as Virginia, New York and California.\nSchumitz attributed Maryland’s lower poverty numbers to supplemental federal assistance programs and the state’s own working family tax credit. \nAlthough Maryland also targeted relief to undocumented people who faced exclusions from the various federal programs, Schumitz said the effort did not erase the racial inequalities still affecting communities across the state. \n“The hardship rates in Maryland remain well above pre-pandemic levels,” Schumitz said. “There (are) still really large racial inequities because people of color faced the hardships of the pandemic and on top of the existing structural barriers that are already causing more people of color in Maryland to be more likely to be in poverty.” \nUsing the supplemental poverty measure, the Urban Institute drew from the Census Bureau’s methods for estimating poverty. \n“There’s the traditional, official poverty measure that’s been around for decades, and that one just counts people’s cash income,” said Laura Wheaton, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute and an author of the report. “It doesnt count things like tax credits or SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program) benefits or housing subsidies.” \nTo define the poverty level, the institute used more recent data on what people spend on food, shelter, clothing and utilities, according to Wheaton. \nThe poverty measure also subtracts taxes and work-related and childcare expenses from individuals’ incomes. \n“Whereas the Census Bureau releases reports each year with their estimates of poverty under the supplemental poverty measure based on survey data, we extend that becausea lot of times in survey data people underreport fair receipt of certain benefits,” Wheaton said. \n“We use a model that corrects for that underreporting, so it brings benefits up to the levels paid according to the government and other government sources,” she explained. \nApart from the American Rescue Plan’s impact, Wheaton said the Urban Institute’s data on the projected number of people kept out of poverty in 2021 also includes the standard safety net programs and the other benefit expansions made in response to the pandemic.\nRegardless of these numbers, the Urban Institute said its analysis was based only on estimates; complete data on 2021 will not be available from the Census Bureau until September 2022. \n“But we know that people want to have an idea of what’s happening in real time, especially in these pandemic times,” Wheaton said. “So, that’s why we’re doing these kinds of projections, to try to give people an idea of what likely is happening, that it’s a projection.”"

    "title": "Despite TSA mandate, some Metro riders aren’t masked",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  Norah Riester was on her way home from a Washington Nationals game on a Friday evening when she encountered unmasked passengers in Metro rail cars. \nThe first car she boarded contained about four or five riders who were either not wearing masks or wearing them improperly, she said. The next car she boarded carried about 10 to 15 passengers. All but one of them was completely unmasked.\n“ It shouldnt be that hard to just wear a mask for like 15 minutes while you take the train or whatever it might be,” she said. “No ones forcing you to take public transportation. But if youre going to take public transportation, you should respect the people around you.”\nThe Transportation Security Administration on Aug. 20 extended the mask mandate for all public transportation networks, including on commercial planes and commuter bus and rail systems through Jan. 18. Despite this mandate, Metro patrons are encountering fellow riders who are ignoring the mandate, and health experts warn that behavior could jeopardize public health and safety. \nThe risk of contracting COVID-19 on public transit depends on a variety of variables, including local rates of infection and the ventilation in a vehicle, said Dr. Amesh Adalja, who is board-certified in infectious diseases and a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. \nThe risk of infection on public transit increases when passengers don’t wear masks, Adalja said. \n“The more of them there are, the more the risk goes on,” he said.\nNot only are unmasked people placing themselves at risk of infection, but if infected, they’re risking the safety of others by spreading the virus, said Dr. Pia MacDonald, senior director of applied public health research at RTI International. \n“So there’s a lot of factors that go into it, and its just important now while were still working on getting more and more people in our communities vaccinated that people adhere to the mask guidelines in terms of minimizing risk in these very public settings where a lot of different people are mixing,” she said. \nDerek Van Tassel, a Northern Virginia resident who uses Metro to commute to and from work, said the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority inconsistently enforces the mask mandate at best. He said he daily spots unmasked people, including passengers, Metro employees and Metro Transit Police officers.\nMetro Transit Police don’t always intervene with violators, Van Tassel said. But when they do, he said it’s effective. \nFor instance, one time after he texted transit police about unmasked riders, officers stopped the train and handed masks to every noncompliant passenger, which the passengers kept on, Van Tassel said. \n“In the event an MTPD officer sees an individual without a mask, they will provide one to the customer, no questions asked,” Metro told Capital News Service in an email. “In addition, we continue to emphasize compliance without conflict, and ask that employees not confront customers but utilize other options available to them such as providing a mask to them.”\nWashington resident Adriana Radulescu said she witnessed a bus driver in the beginning of the pandemic refuse to let a commuter board a bus until she put on a mask. But recently an operator let a rider enter a bus without wearing a mask, she said. \n“ I guess she didn’t want this woman to be right in her face,” Radulescu said, speculating about the latter driver. “I truly think (theres) nothing they can do. These people are trained and their job is to transport people from A to B in a safe way, not to be policing people on the buses.” \nRadulescu said she feels her whole body tense when she sees unmasked commuters. They’re mostly older people who sit next to the driver, she added.  \nFor their protection, Metro said, bus operators have the option of stopping rides due to unsafe conditions and contacting transit police for assistance.\nFirst-time offenders of the mask mandate may be penalized any amount between $500 and $1000, according to TSA.  Second-time offenders may be penalized anywhere from $1000 to $3000. \nMetro would not tell CNS if it issues fines to unmasked riders. \nIn a statement, Metro said it offers customers free masks and reminds them of the mandate with signage and other communications. \nSome riders have taken it upon themselves to call on passengers to wear masks.\nMetro rider Zack Ford of Washington said he asked a rail rider who took a mask off to sneeze to put it back on. Ford said he hasn’t seen very many people unmasked and hopes passengers remain dedicated to wearing them. \n“ I want to protect myself and protect them, and I hope that they would do the same for me,” he said.\nVan Tassel said he’s experienced riders arguing with him after he asked if they would wear their masks. \nAnd Riester, recalling her travels home from the Nationals game on her first train, said it was up to the passengers to remind others to properly mask. \n“ They complained, but they complied,” she said, noting one rider used vaccination status as an excuse for not wearing a mask. \nDr. David Marcozzi, chief clinical officer at the University of Maryland Medical Center, advises wearing masks indoors or in areas with a lot of people, regardless of being vaccinated, because the Delta variant is easily spread.\nRobert Wald of Silver Spring said he informed a Metro employee about unmasked passengers at a rail station. \n“I didnt want to tell him how to do his job,” he said. “I just kind of waited for him to reply, there was no reply, and he kind of walked on … . But it just struck me as wrong.” \n“I fully understand how difficult it is for the Metro employees to have to ask these people to constantly (put) masks on, Riester said. “If the Metro really wants to keep people safe, … they need to be doing more than just, honestly, whatever it is they’re doing.”"

    "title": "U.S. Capitol fencing returns ahead of January 6 riot defendants rally",
    "content": "This story has been updated as of 10:07 a.m. Wednesday.\nWASHINGTON — Security fencing was installed Wednesday around the United States Capitol Building ahead of a Saturday rally supporting those jailed in connection with the deadly Jan. 6 insurrection.\nThe Capitol Police Board on Monday approved a plan to temporarily erect a fence around the Capitol. \n“We are here to protect everyone’s First Amendment right to peacefully protest,” Capitol Police Chief Tom Manger said in a statement. “I urge anyone who is thinking about causing trouble to stay home. We will enforce the law and not tolerate violence.”\nThe fencing is encircling the Capitol grounds but is not hindering pedestrian or vehicular traffic on the surrounding streets.\nLaw enforcement officials appear to be planning a show of force amidst widespread criticism of the rally as a thinly-disguised extension of the first rally, fueled by lies spread by former President Donald Trump and his allies that he won last year’s presidential election.\n“These people are coming back to praise the people who were out to kill, out to kill members of Congress, successfully causing the deaths  ‘successfully’ is not the word, but that’s the word, because it’s what they set out to do   of our law enforcement,” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-California, told reporters last week.\n Far-right extremists stormed the Capitol Jan. 6, aiming to obstruct the certification of President Joe Biden’s electoral victory. Five police officers died following the attack, including four by suicide. Two of the rioters also died.\n More than 570 people have been arrested in connection with the event, according to the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia.\nThere was no fencing around the Capitol grounds on Jan. 6, but it was put up after the insurrection and remained in place for six months. The Capitol itself has been closed to the public since the start of the coronavirus pandemic in the spring of 2020, the longest closure in the iconic building’s history. \n Look Ahead America, an organization headed by a former Trump campaign operative, is planning the “Justice for J6” rally on the Capitol’s East end of the National Mall in front of the Capitol.\n“We’re going to be safe. We’re going to raise our voices in defense of our fellow Americans who’ve had their rights and due process violated,” said Matt Braynard, the nonprofit’s executive director, in a YouTube video on the organization’s website. “We’re going to raise our voices demanding justice for Ashli Babbitt, and for the government to come clean on whatever involvement the FBI might have had in the events of Jan. 6.”\n A Capitol Police officer fatally shot Babbitt during the Jan. 6 riot as she attempted to breach barricaded doors leading to the lobby off the House of Representatives chamber. \n“The January 6th attack on the U.S. Capitol is a stain on our democracy,” House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Mechanicsville, told CNS in an email. “I believe it is the right decision to strengthen security around the Capitol in anticipation of the upcoming ‘Justice for J6’ rally this Saturday based on the intel ahead of the event.”\nCapitol Police said it “is aware of concerning online chatter.” And the Capitol Police Board last week issued an emergency declaration allowing the department to deputize outside law enforcement as Capitol Police special officers. \nAccording to NBC News, Melissa Smislova, deputy undersecretary for intelligence enterprise readiness at the Homeland Security Department, said the agency estimates that about 700 people will attend the rally.\n In an interview with WTOP on Braynard’s Youtube channel, he said he had no safety concerns and that “there’s not going to be any violence.”\nHe declined to be interviewed by CNS. \nA United States Capitol Police command vehicle sits near the United States Capitol Building Wednesday. (Brittany N. Gaddy/Capital News Service)\nSen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Maryland, told CNS that it’s important the rally is taken seriously.\n“We witnessed a violent mob attack the Capitol of the United States, attack our democracy,” he said. “And now you have people organizing in support of those who violently attacked the Capitol. It has to be taken with the utmost seriousness, and everything Ive seen indicates that the Capitol Police are taking this seriously.”\nRep. C. A. Dutch Ruppersberger, D-Timonium, in an email to CNS, said: “I trust that our federal, state and local law enforcement agencies, including their intelligence units, are working collaboratively to prevent a reoccurrence of January 6 this weekend, including additional fencing.”\n Washington’s Metropolitan Police will be “fully prepared” ahead of the rally and will have an increased presence around the city at the locations of the demonstrations, Alaina Gertz, a public affairs specialist for the department told CNS in an email.\n“We are continuously working with local and federal partners to ensure that safety protocols are in place for all events and other first amendment activities,” U.S. Park Police said in an email. \n“We want to reassure everyone these are temporary measures to ensure everyone’s safety,” Manger said. “We are extremely grateful for the support we continue to receive from the local community and our congressional stakeholders as we carry out our critical mission.”"

    "title": "Broad coalition launches effort to help resettle Afghan refugees; Hogan urges aid",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  A widespread coalition of political, religious and business leaders, joined by numerous large companies and advocacy organizations, on Tuesday launched an effort to help Afghan evacuees resettle in the United States.\nThe new group, called Welcome.US, seeks to engage the American public in welcoming Afghan refugees in a multifaceted effort, Cecelia Muñoz, the initiative’s co-founder, said at a virtual press conference. The former director of the White House Domestic Policy Council under President Barack Obama, she is senior adviser to New America, a public policy group.\nThe initiative will try to make it easier for Americans to donate to frontline organizations and sponsor Afghan families arriving in the United States.\n“Welcome.US is being launched in response to this outpouring from the American people to channel and fan its flames, building on the extraordinary work so many tireless frontline organizations have been leading,” co-founder John Bridgeland said. He was director of the White House Domestic Policy Council under President George W. Bush. He is president and CEO of Civic Enterprises, a public policy firm.\nAfghan-American organizations, faith-based groups, resettlement agencies, businesses, veterans, nonprofits, universities and political leaders have joined the initiative.\nMaryland Gov. Larry Hogan also expressed his support for Welcome.US, urging Marylanders to help Afghan evacuees resettling in this country through donating money to frontline organizations, hosting families or providing essential services.\n“When America began its withdrawal from Afghanistan, I made it clear that Maryland was ready and willing to welcome these Afghan allies,” Hogan said at the press conference.\nHogan also spoke of America’s history of compassion and commitment to helping others.\n“Today, we’re calling on that spirit of compassion yet again,” Hogan said. “The thousands of Afghan allies, who desperately need our help now, have been our strong allies for the past two decades.”\nWelcome.US’s co-chairs include Obama, Bush and former President Bill Clinton, as well as former first ladies Michelle Obama, Laura Bush and Hillary Clinton.\n“Many of the refugees fleeing Afghanistan stood by America and risked everything for a chance at a better life,” Obama tweeted. “With the launch of Welcome.US, we can support our new Afghan neighbors and reaffirm our common humanity. I hope youll join us.”\nWelcome.US’s launch comes during a pivotal moment in Afghan-American relations. The withdrawal of American troops and the Taliban’s control in Afghanistan left hundreds of thousands of Afghan allies struggling to escape and find new places to call home.\nThe initiative also begins shortly after the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks.\n“But this call to action transcends the toxic politics of the moment, and I ask all Marylanders  and all Americans  to help us prove once again why this nation truly is ‘the last best hope of earth,’” Hogan said.\nPotential congressional legislation aimed at helping Afghan evacuees could affect the impact of Welcome.US.\n“Congress has some serious work to do to make this success possible,” said Nazanin Ash, the International Rescue Committee’s vice president of global policy and advocacy.\nAsh pointed to the Biden administration’s request for funding and authority on extending refugee benefits to Afghan evacuees and providing them a path to permanent legal residency in the United States.\n“Without this assistance, Afghan evacuees will not be able to access healthcare, language services or secure other public and private benefits that will help them find their footing and get a leg up in their new country,” Ash said."

    "content": "The United States Marine Band is premiering a new composition to mark the 20th anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks in New York, Washington and Shanksville, Pennsylvania.\nThe piece, titled These Lights, Which Shine, was composed by Marine Band Assistant Director Maj. Ryan J. Nowlin.\nThe video of the premiere, in which Marine Band Director Col. Jason K. Fettig directs the Marine Chamber Orchestra and the Joint Armed Forces Chorus, was released Friday. The tribute was performed in Washington National Cathedral.\n\n\nNowlins inspiration for his composition, according to a Marine Band news release, was a Yiddish poem called Yeish Kochavin, by Hannah Senesh. It means There are Stars or Among the Stars. Senesh was in the British Armys special operations during World War II. She was captured by the enemy, tortured and executed in 1944. She was 23.\n“Her writings have this beauty which really spoke to me,” Nowlin said.\nBased on a translation by Bruce L. Ruben, these are the words sung by the chorus:\nThere are stars whose light reaches the earth\nonly after they themselves are no more.\n\nThere are people whose radiant memory shines in the world\neven after they themselves have left it.\n\nThese lights  which shine in the darkest night \nThese, these illumine the path for us all."

    "title": "9/11: Maryland fire department marks horrific day and long effort to memorialize it",
    "content": "Former Fire Chief James Stanton, 79, a U.S. Navy veteran who was in Vietnam between 1964 to 1968, started his fire service career at the Kensington Volunteer Fire Department one year after an honorable discharge. He dedicated a lifetime of service to Montgomery County — 52 years to be exact.\nBut nothing could have prepared him for September 11, 2001.\n“We didn’t know where we’re going or what we were going to do, but we knew that the country was in a crisis,” Stanton told Capital News Service. \nOn that day 20 years ago, Deputy Chief Mike Kelly stood by Stanton’s side in a staff meeting inside Station 5 on Connecticut Avenue, all watching in horror as United Airlines Flight 75 flew into the South Tower of the World Trade Center in New York. \nTheir meeting abruptly ended. Shortly after, hijacked American Airlines Flight 77 crashed into the western wall of the Pentagon, killing all 64 passengers and crew as well as 125 others who were inside the building.\nStanton and Kelly immediately went to work, trying to call their fellow volunteer firefighters to the station. When the reinforcements arrived, they simply waited on standby.\n“A lot of people ran to the sites. We did not do that,” Stanton said. “We didn’t self-dispatch anybody there. We staffed up, we were going to take what came on, because frankly, we didn’t know what was gonna happen.” \nFinally, a call came through — around 6 p.m. that same evening. A duty operations chief contacted Stanton, requesting additional support: Tower 705, a 100-foot-long aerial ladder truck.\nStanton assigned an ambulance and command officer to accompany their crew on the ladder truck, which could carry no more than six. Four were supposed to go in the ambulance.\n“They’re ready to go out the door, I open the back door handles of the ambulance and there were eight people in there,” Stanton recalled, chuckling. “I just closed the door.” \nOne way or another, the entire Kensington department was determined to get dispatched to the damaged Pentagon — even if they were “going to sneak in,” Stanton said.\nRoads were still jammed: a journey to the headquarters of the U.S. Department of Defense — 13 miles away — had been bogged down in traffic.\n“When we got there, the fires were mainly out,” the former fire chief remembered.\nTower 705 still sprang into action, scaling the 71-foot-tall Pentagon.\n“I was always proud of the people, but they really stepped up. Everybody wanted to help,” Stanton added. “They would have gone to New York, they would have gone (earlier) to the Pentagon if we let them.”\nEven after the fires had been snuffed out and the debris cleared, Kensington’s Fire Department members stood out in front of their firehouse for an entire week, raising $35,000 for New York City firefighters and their families.\nEight years after the deadly terror attack at the Pentagon, Steven R. Semler, 76, a former KVFD president, was appointed by the department’s board to chair the KVFD 9/11 Memorial Committee. He applied for pieces of metal from the September 11th Families’ Association, a nonprofit tasked to distribute remnant artifacts once the metallurgical testing of structural steel from the World Trade Center had been completed. \n“I saw that as a wonderful opportunity to try to get the piece of metal because we were attached to 9/11, in that our people responded to the Pentagon,” Semler told CNS.\nOnce their application had been properly filed, “it languished,” Semler revealed, until he personally spoke with Lee A. Ielpi, president of the September 11th Families’ Association. Ielpi was a highly-decorated retired FDNY member who lost his 29-year-old son and fellow firefighter, Anthony, on 9/11. He spent nine months searching for his body at Ground Zero, later contracting cancer in 2006. \n“And I told him, ‘Not good enough. I don’t want a piece of metal that looks like it came out of Home Depot,’” Semler said. “‘I need something that captures the scarred twisting fire hell of the inferno of that day.’”\nSemler’s blunt approach generated an invitation to visit Lower Manhattan’s “sacred ground” — Ground Zero — and the two airplane hangars located at the John F. Kennedy International Airport where the World Trade Center artifacts were kept. \nSemler said he picked out an “unwieldy piece of one ton, 16-foot-tall artifact metal.” It was fastened to the flatbed of a borrowed trailer and transported by Keith Golden and Ernesto Moretti, two KVFD lifetime department members. The steel was stored inside Station 21 in Aspen Hill.\n“We had the metal, but we didn’t have the resources to build Memorial Park,” Semler admitted. \nThe late Steve Heidenberger stepped forward. Owner of Heidenberg Construction, Inc., he donated construction and building materials for the planned memorial.\nHeidenberg’s brother, Thomas, lost his wife, Michele, 52, on United Airlines Flight 77. She was a senior flight attendant.\nGround was broken on Kensington’s 9/11 Memorial Park in 2011. \nChris Van Hollen, then a congressman representing Maryland’s 8th District, participated in the groundbreaking. Now Sen. Van Hollen, he’s scheduled to speak at the Kensington Volunteer Fire Department’s annual ceremony this weekend — a decade after the groundbreaking. \nOn April 2, 2011, the groundbreaking ceremony for the 9/11 Memorial Park occurred just outside the Kensington, Md., Volunteer Fire Department’s Station 5, with (from left) then-Fire Chief James Stanton, then-Rep. and now Sen. Chris Van Hollen, Kensington Mayor Peter Fosselman and KVFD President Steven R. Semler. (Photo courtesy of Kensington Volunteer Fire Department)\n“I think it is fitting that they have a memorial at their fire station,” Van Hollen told CNS in an interview. “They are sort of our sentinels, who are ready to respond to protect our local communities.”\n“For the first time many Americans realized that two big oceans did not protect us from this kind of terrorist attack. Americans did come together, in a great spirit of unity,” the senator added. “We were resilient, we would persevere and we would make sure the country came together in the aftermath of those terrible attacks.” \nTwo decades later, the nation is in a different place. Intensifying partisanship and political divisiveness culminated in the deadly Jan. 6 attack on the United States Capitol.\n“You fast forward to January 6, and instead of an external attack on the United States, we had a domestic attack on our Capitol and our democracy,” Van Hollen said. “And that, obviously, was a symbol of incredible disunion in the country and polarization.”\nA member of the Senate’s Foreign Affairs Committee, Van Hollen is concerned with the rise of domestic terrorism.\n“I do very much fear that today, the much greater threat to our democracy is not an external terrorist threat,” Van Hollen said. “We need to recognize that while we came together in the aftermath of 9/11, sadly, we witnessed a huge amount of division in the country; and, of course, that was most evident on that day that will live in infamy, which is Jan. 6.”\nAs the nation mourns the loss of 2,977 lives — and counting — in New York, Washington and Shanksville, Pennsylvania, Van Hollen said he hopes the country can come together and “rekindle a little more of that spirit of unity” in the future.\n“If you look at where we are today, we are obviously cleaved by these deep divisions,” Van Hollen said. “We should work to recapture that spirit of unity that brought us together in the aftermath of that terrible tragedy and that attack.”"

    "title": "Chesapeake Bay area lawmakers urge EPA to enforce pollution standards",
    "content": "Senators from the Chesapeake Bay region are asking the Biden administration to enforce strict water pollution standards in Pennsylvania and New York to help meet previously-agreed goals for restoring the Bay.\nThe lawmakers, all Democrats, told new Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Michael Regan in a letter last month that efforts to reduce certain Bay pollution sources by 2025 “are at a critical juncture.” \n“Our concern has been the state of Pennsylvania has been falling significantly short of the goals that they need to reach in order for us to meet the overall pollution goals for the Bay in 2025,” Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Maryland, one of the co-authors of the letter, said in an interview with Capital News Service. \nThe senators told Regan that Pennsylvania would only meet 75 percent of its target to cut nitrogen pollution. New York also would fall short of its nitrogen goal by 1 million pounds, they said.\nIn addition to Van Hollen, the senators on the letter were Ben Cardin of Maryland, Tom Carper and Chris Coons of Delaware, and Mark Warner and Tim Kaine of Virginia. \nIn 2010, the EPA established the Chesapeake Bay Total Maximum Daily Load for pollutants permitted without violating water quality standards. The standards applied to the Bay’s surrounding states: Maryland, Virginia, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Delaware, New York, and the District of Columbia.\n“It sets limits for pollution that equate to a 25 percent reduction in nitrogen, 24 percent reduction in phosphorus, and 20 percent reduction in sediment,” the senators’ letter noted. \nUnder the Bay pollution daily load plan, the EPA has the power to enforce water quality standards and to require additional reductions in sources of pollution to meet the 2025 goals.\n“We ask that you use all tools at your disposalto make sure that all jurisdictions are on track for 2025,” the senators wrote.\n“Because the Bay is a watershed that encompasses multiple states and the District of Columbia, the role of the federal government through the EPA is essential to bringing different states together to comply with our pollution reduction targets,” Van Hollen told CNS.\nLast September, the Chesapeake Bay Foundation filed a lawsuit against the EPA for “failing to comply with their responsibilities under the Clean Water Act and the Blueprint,” according to the foundation’s website. The case was later consolidated with similar lawsuits filed by attorneys general in Maryland, Virginia, Delaware and the District of Columbia.\n“Those (lawsuits) in my view are important measures to take to push the EPA in the right direction,” Van Hollen said. “The previous administration did not do enough, in my view.”\nFoundation President William Baker said in January that “if Pennsylvania does not meet its obligations… the Chesapeake Bay will never be saved.”\nThe EPA responded to a request for comment from CNS with this statement: “Administrator Regan, in remarks as a nominee before the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, acknowledged that the Chesapeake Bay is a national treasure. He offered his commitment as EPA administrator to ‘look for all the resources we can bring to bear to protect the Chesapeake Bay’ and to help our state partners meet the 2025 goal of having all practices in place to restore the Bay and its tidal waters.” \n“As such,” the statement continued, “we look forward to taking the next steps in providing funding and technical assistance, tracking and reporting progress, coordinating and facilitating partnership efforts through the Chesapeake Bay Program Office, and taking appropriate actions within our Clean Water Act authorities.”\nVan Hollen added that he is hopeful the Biden administration and the EPA will provide states the tools or resources they need to meet the pollution standards and use its enforcing power for states like Pennsylvania.\n“This was a letter to accomplish two goals,” Van Hollen said, “One is to say ‘We look forward to working with the Biden administration to protect the Chesapeake Bay,’ but also, ‘We’re counting on you to strongly enforce the pollution reduction goals that are necessary to keep the Bay healthy.’”\nMeanwhile, the governors of the states in the Bay watershed, along with District Mayor Muriel Bowser and Virginia Del. David Bulova, chairman of the Chesapeake Bay Commission, are asking Congress for more federal support for cleanup.\n“Our proposal is the Billion for the Bay Initiative: a significant and much needed infusion of new funds that will jumpstart the final phase of Bay restoration and put people to work building clean water infrastructure, including green infrastructure that will reduce stormwater and agricultural water pollution, the restoration of natural landscapes, and helping us adapt to the impacts of climate change,” the May 13 letter to congressional leaders said.\nThe governors signing the letter were Maryland’s Larry Hogan, a Republican; Virginia’s Ralph Northam, a Democrat; Pennsylvania’s Tom Wolf, a Democrat; West Virginia’s Jim Justice, a Republican; Delaware’s John Carney; and New York’s Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat.  \nThe Chesapeake Bay Total Maximum Daily Load is intended to address decades of pollution in the 64,000-square mile watershed from urban and agricultural runoff, wastewater contamination and air pollution. The poor water quality not only has affected aquatic life but also has threatened industries dependent on the Bay, from recreational tourism to fishing.\nThe Bay and its many tributaries is home to nearly 18 million people and hosts a vast array of 3,700 species of fish, animals and plants."

(@EU_Commission) May 3, 2021\n\nThe EU on May 3 proposed a path for member countries to ease restrictions on non-essential travel due to the increase in worldwide COVID-19 vaccinations.\n“The Commission proposes to allow entry to the EU for non-essential reasons not only for all persons coming from countries with a good epidemiological situation but also all people who have received the last recommended dose of an EU-authorised vaccine,” the EU statement said.\nFour of the top 10 most popular international destinations for American tourists are in the EU: France, Italy, Germany and Spain.\nBut the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention still is recommending that no Americans travel to those four nations and five others in the top 10: Canada, Mexico, the United Kingdom, Dominican Republic and Jamaica.\nThe CDC did not nix travel to China, but urged the usual COVID precautions.\n“All travelers should wear a mask, avoid crowds, stay at least 6 feet from people who are not traveling with you, wash your hands often or use hand sanitizer, and watch your health for signs of illness,” the CDC says on its website.\nIn contrast, hopeful vacationers are warned to stay away from China by the U.S. Department of State’s Bureau of Consular Affairs, but not because of COVID dangers.\n“The People’s Republic of China government arbitrarily enforces local laws, including… wrongful detentions and… exit bans on U.S. citizens and citizens of other countries without due process of law,” the agency warns on its website.\nCanada and Mexico, the two most popular international tourist destinations for Americans, are maintaining closed border agreements with the United States. Officially, the closed borders among Canada, Mexico and the United States are set to end on May 21, but the closures have been renewed more than once and may continue to be renewed until sometime later this summer, according to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection Information Center.\nOne traditionally major international travel draw is not going to be open to Americans  or to anyone else: the rescheduled 2020 Olympic games in Tokyo are slated to go on in July with only Japanese spectators.\nIndia’s struggle to curb the pandemic appears to have barely started. The numbers of cases and deaths still are rising.\nAfrican nations, meanwhile, are scrambling to get vaccines. The World Health Organization reported last month that less than 2% of available global vaccines had been administered on the continent.\n“Africa is already playing COVID-19 vaccination catch-up, and the gap is widening. While we acknowledge the immense burden placed by the global demand for vaccines, inequity can only worsen scarcity,” said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, the WHO’s regional director for Africa.\nIn Latin America and the Caribbean, COVID-19 has been surging. Brazil’s health system has been near collapse and the CDC has warned that “even fully vaccinated travelers may be at risk for getting and spreading COVID-19 variants.”\nWhile Australia has reduced cases to a mere handful, officials have been cautious about reopening that country. Local travel officials say they expect to see easing of restrictions by early summer.\nMeanwhile, most major cruise ship lines have set the earliest resumption of operations for the end of June, Travel Weekly reported. Some previously scheduled cruises out of U.S. ports have been postponed until at least August.\n﻿﻿!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var e in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var t=document.getElementById(\"datawrapper-chart-\"+e)||document.querySelector(\"iframe﻿[src*='\"+e+\"']﻿\");t&&(t.style.height=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][e]+\"px\")}}))}();\n\nIn Europe, even as the EU begins contemplating reopening borders to outsiders, individual countries have been more verbally proactive about plans for this summer.\n“We will progressively lift the restrictions of the beginning of May…We are working hard to propose a very concrete solution, especially for U.S. citizens who are vaccinated, so with a special pass,” French President Emmanuel Macron said on April 19.\nThe so-called “special pass” refers to the Digital Green Certificate program currently in progress in Europe, where travelers “should be able to prove their vaccination status,” according to the EU, with allowances made for similar proof-of-vaccination certificates from non-EU countries like the United States.\nThe Italian government is similarly eager to reopen to travelers, according to Prime Minister Mario Draghi.\n“Our cities and our countryside are reopening, and this process will speed up in the coming weeks and monthsI have no doubt that tourism in Italy will bounce back, as strong as it was before  and even stronger,” Draghi said in a speech after the G20 Tourism Ministers’ Meeting on May 4. “Its time for you to book your holidays in Italy. We look forward to welcoming you again, soon.”\nPresident Joe Biden is hoping that 70% of Americans will have received at least one dose of a COVID vaccination by July 4. At the moment, that figure is about 56%. He also hopes that by that time a total of 160 million adults will be fully vaccinated.\nThe president’s goal theoretically could be met around the same time that some countries are hoping to loosen their international travel laws.\nThe EU is particularly hopeful that vaccination rates will continue to improve.\nContinued successful vaccination campaigns “indicate that there is room to ease travel restrictions, particularly for those already vaccinated,” the EU said. “In this sense, this proposal aims at progressively resuming travel from third countries in a safe manner, relaunching tourism, especially in view of the summer season, and business traveling, thus fostering the recovery of Europe’s economy.”\nThe imposition of international travel bans in most countries as the global pandemic surged in 2020 were a huge financial hit to the world’s tourism industry.\nA recent report from the World Travel and Tourism Council said the U.S. travel and tourism industry saw a GDP loss of $766 billion in 2020, a 41 percent drop from the $1.9 trillion generated by travel and tourism in 2019.\nWith the staggering loss of jobs and business, the U.S. economy, as well as those of other countries, plummeted during the pandemic. Travel-supported jobs worldwide decreased from 16.7 million in 2019 to 11.1 million in 2020, according to the WTTC."

    "title": "Bipartisan legislation aims to strengthen U.S. competitive position against China",
    "content": "A bipartisan effort in the Senate has produced two pieces of legislation to increase government investment in American technology and industry to counter economic and strategic challenges from China. \nI believe that China today, led by the Communist Party and propelled by Xi Jinpings hyper-nationalism, is unlike any challenge we have ever faced as a nation, said Sen. Robert Menendez, D-New Jersey, during the Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing on the Strategic Competition Act of 2021. He is chairman of the panel and one of the bill’s primary sponsors.\nThe legislation, crafted in negotiations with Sen. James Risch of Idaho, the committee’s ranking Republican, was passed on April 21 and sent to the full Senate for consideration.\nThe measure addresses a series of economic and political priorities to ensure the security and competitive position of the United States in the face Chinas aggressive bid to become a greater influence in global politics and trade. \nThe bill will help us reinforce and rebuild our alliances and partnerships, restore American leadership of international and regional organizations, and respond to Chinas predatory economic practices, Menendez said. (It) will reinvest in replenishing the sources of our economic strength and innovation, and ground our approach to China in our values and highest aspirations as a nation.\nIf passed, the legislation would establish a Technology Partnership Office within the State Department. The office would perform oversight to ensure that critical U.S. technologies were not dependent on supplies from China.\nAmong other measures, the bill would target the nation’s multilateral supply chain by establishing a program to help American companies move their facilities out of China and find non-Chinese alternatives for sourcing and production.\nThe challenge we are facing from China deserves no less than what we are undertaking here, Risch said. “I cant overstate the significance of the bill. It has the potential to be an important step toward ensuring the U.S. is postured to compete with China for decades to come.\nHe said that the Chinese influence on Americas college and university system has become dangerous and needs to be considered. Therefore, the legislation includes a provision for the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) to expand the review process of certain foreign gifts over $1 million to American universities for research, production and development of critical technologies. \nWe dont allow our politicians to take money from China. Because we dont want them influenced with the kinds of things that China is peddling. Risch said. There is no reason why these important institutions, which are debating and that are producing the future leaders of this country, should have that kind of influence if indeed it is put there for malign purposes.\nRisch said he expected pushback from colleges and universities, but he said it is not suitable to be taking money from the Chinese Communist Party.\nThe Strategic Competition Act also carries several provisions to address human rights abuses in China. \nSen. Ben Cardin, D-Maryland, praised the legislation’s “strong commitment to human rights.” \nCardin secured several amendments to the legislation regarding corruption within the Chinese regime, the plight of the Uighurs and the Hong Kong human rights activists. \n It is extremely urgent that we make it clear that Congress maintains its support for the global Magnitsky sanctions, which have been so widely accepted globally as a very important tool against the Russian Federation and other governments that have abused the rights of their citizens, Cardin said.\nThe Global Magnitsky Act sunsets in December 2022, meaning no new sanctions could be imposed after that date if the act is not reauthorized. Cardins amendment to the legislation would remove the sunset clause and was included in the approved bill. \nSeparate from the Strategic Competition Act of 2021 is a measure called the Endless Frontier Act, which was reintroduced by Sen. Todd Young, R-Indiana, and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-New York.\nIf passed, the legislation would authorize $100 billion through the National Science Foundation to pursue commercialization, innovation, and research for technologies related to national security and the relationship between the United States and China.\nAnother $10 billion would be authorized for the Department of Commerce to designate regional technology hubs.\nThe legislation would ensure new research investments translate into American industries and manufacturing and high-tech jobs in regions across the country to become global centers of emerging technology, Young said in a statement.\nSchumer said the Endless Frontier Act is the key to preserving America’s position as a current and future technological leader by boosting innovation and strengthening its research and development capabilities..\n“In the coming weeks, the Senate will turn to this legislation and other pieces of bipartisan China-related legislation to ensure that the U.S. government’s hand at home and abroad is as strong as possible as we compete with China on all fronts,” he said.\nSeveral industry leaders have voiced their support for the Schumer-Young bill.\nBobby Franklin, president and CEO of the National Venture Capital Association, wrote to Young and Schumer: If effectively implemented, this legislation will meaningfully increase federal basic research investment and technology commercialization activity, improve our nations long-term economic competitiveness, create new industries and high-quality 21st-century jobs, and increase economic growth in communities across the country.\nYoung said the Chinese Communist Party is pushing a view of a divided United States to the world. \nThis is a rare opportunity to show the authoritarians in Beijing, and the rest of the world, that when it comes to our national security, and most importantly our China policy, we are united, he said."

    "title": "Emergency first responders doing vital but dangerous work during the pandemic",
    "content": "Megan OBrien at the Bethesda-Chevy Chase Rescue Squad in Montgomery County, Maryland. (Photo: Robin Fader)\nMegan O’Brien is an infectious disease epidemiologist by day, and an EMT by night at the Bethesda-Chevy Chase Rescue Squad in Maryland.\nHer title is roving night crew officer and she works from 7 p.m. to 7 a.m. A volunteer at the rescue squad since 2014, O’Brien believes that it’s a way to be involved in the community and she enjoys the work.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic drastically altered the work for her and her fellow EMTs across the nation. They faced a unique and ever-present danger: 7% of all American frontline deaths due to the pandemic between March 2020 and April 2021 were medical first responders, according to a joint investigation by Kaiser Health News and the Guardian.\nEmergency medical services workers are some of the most vulnerable front-line workers, with much of their funding and equipment dependent on the support of local government.\n﻿\nAs the coronavirus pandemic raged last fall, a study found that “EMS personnel are at a higher risk of dying from COVID-19 than other healthcare or emergency services professionals.” COVID deaths among emergency services workers was estimated to be three times higher than among nurses and five times higher than among doctors, according to the study, published on EMS1.com, a website that serves the emergency medical services community.\nAs in countless other communities, O’Brien’s unit had to overhaul procedures to protect the safety of the EMTs.\nO’Brien is the head of the COVID task force with the Bethesda-Chevy Chase station. She helped to develop and implement policies on COVID safety.\n“Everything was really designed to try to do everything we could to protect our personnel from getting COVID and then take care of our patients as safely as we could,” O’Brien told Capital News Service.\nTo limit the station’s exposure to COVID, new guidelines limited the time that EMTs spent in the back of the vehicle with patients and reduced the number of personnel that could be in the station to the minimum. The squad stopped hiring new recruits and followed other requirements put in place by the Montgomery County Rescue Service.\n﻿﻿\n“Montgomery County (has) been very helpful in having policies and procedures in place that we should follow to keep ourselves safe,” said EMS Lt. Jay Gruber, spokesman for the nearby Wheaton Volunteer Rescue Squad. “And theyve been providing us a lot of PPE. The county’s been very supportive.”\nGruber, who is also the chief of police at Georgetown University and the former chief of police in College Park, Maryland, has been working with the volunteer rescue squad for 35 years.\nMontgomery County Fire Rescue Service “pivoted very quickly helping keep the community safe, and making sure that they get their needs met,” Gruber said.\nProtecting the volunteers’ safety also has driven significant changes to official on-scene procedures.\n“Normally, an EMS provider will wear glovesEven during normal times, you have access to face masks, and eye protection,” Gruber explained. “With COVID… we have various types of masks that we wear for various situations. We also have mandatory use of eyewear and gowns on people who are under investigation as COVID patients and multiple layers of gloves.”\nAfter a patient has been transported to a hospital, especially a suspected COVID patient, aggressive cleaning and decontamination of rescue squad equipment  stretchers, electronic equipment, walls, ceilings, floors  follows.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA post shared by BethesdaChevyChaseRescueSquad (@bccrs)\n\n\n\nMontgomery County’s emergency medical services system is one of the largest combined career and volunteer emergency services systems in the country, responding to over 120,000 911 calls annually, according to Dr. Meghan E. Quinn, a Navy Medical Corps lieutenant who presented a report about mental health in American volunteer fire/rescue personnel to the American Psychological Association in 2019.\nApproximately half of Montgomery County’s approximately 2,500 emergency medical services workers are volunteers, Quinn said in her report.\nMany communities across the nation reported that emergency services personnel were quitting or retiring because of the dangers from COVID. With the widespread administration of the anti-COVID vaccines, efforts to recruit and train new EMTs are now intensifying, according to various news reports.\nIn Maryland, a person can get an EMT license as early as 16 and can certify as a paramedic at 18. Rescue squad drivers must be at least 19.\nIana Sahadzic, 22, has been a volunteer paramedic with the Bethesda-Chevy Chase Rescue Squad since she was 17. She was attracted to the work after watching EMT volunteers driving down the street, lights flashing and sirens blaring, and realizing that she has always wanted to be in the health profession and help people.\nWhile a volunteer, Sahadzic is also a student at the University of Maryland, where she studies neurobiology and physiology, with a minor in Spanish.\n“Honestly, some weeks Im not quite sure how I manage to fit everything in,” she told CNS. “I have always been a very organized person, but I think that having to balance both school and volunteering as a paramedic has forced me to manage my time much more strictly  I cant go anywhere without my calendar.”\nSahadzic volunteers about 36 hours a week, most of which is overnight. During her down time, she brings her laptop and notebook to study or watch a lecture.\n“Everyone has a different hobby and in my mind helping people in a time of need was the way I wanted to spend my free time.,” she said. “Though some days are harder than others, I am proud to have dedicated so much of my time to the community.”\n﻿!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var e in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var t=document.getElementById(\"datawrapper-chart-\"+e)||document.querySelector(\"iframe[src*='\"+e+\"']\");t&&(t.style.height=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][e]+\"px\")}}))}();\n\nOne of the hardest aspects of volunteering to be an EMT during COVID is the strain on the volunteers and their loved ones.\nWhen the pandemic was at its worst, Sahadzic said she showered multiple times before going home to visit family and followed other precautionary measures to ensure she wouldn’t bring anything home.\n“I was probably trying to distance myself  because you never knew  and spend a lot more time at the fire station, because I felt like maybe, you know, the less time I spend at home the better,” she said. “But its gotten better with the vaccine.”\nO’Brien said she slept in her guest room, away from her husband, as a precaution.\n“There is a light, we can see the end, which was not the case several months ago,” she said. “I think for health care workers, things have really changed since we got vaccinated because you just dont have that same level of fear anymore.”"

    "title": "Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez want $172 billion to overhaul public housing",
    "content": "Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vermont, and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-New York, want the federal government to invest as much as $172 billion over 10 years to transform living conditions for nearly two million people living in public housing.\nThey are sponsoring identical Senate and House bills, each called “the Green New Deal for Public Housing Act,” that would lower utility costs and reduce environmental hazards like lead and water poisoning. \n“At this time of unprecedented crisis, we must move forward to boldly address the systemic and existential threats facing us today,” Sanders said in a statement. “That includes combating climate change and making sure that every American has a safe and decent place to live.”\nThe two progressive lawmakers are looking to go well beyond President Joe Biden’s proposal in his $2 trillion infrastructure plan to spend $40 billion to improve public housing.\nBut the progressives’ plan faces a heavy lift in Congress, where Republicans appear unanimously opposed to anything connected to the Green New Deal.\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, has attacked Biden’s overall agenda as an effort to answer the demands of Sanders and other progressives. \nMcConnell has vowed that he would oppose the infrastructure plan “every step of the way,” and on Monday told reporters “I don’t think there will be any Republican support — none, zero” for either the infrastructure bill or Biden’s nearly $2 trillion jobs and education proposal. \nThe GOP has unveiled a $568 billion infrastructure package that focuses on roads, bridges, transit, ports and wastewater treatment plants. \nThe Green New Deal for Public Housing Act’s $172 billion budget would go to equipping public housing with cutting-edge materials and infrastructure, including energy-efficient windows, improved insulation of roofs and exterior walls, heat-recovery ventilation systems, and solar panels.\nThe budget would also go to upgrading, replacing, and improving public housing units to make them energy efficient. Public housing energy bills with the proposed legislation would be reduced by up to 70 percent, or $613 million, by electrifying all public housing with carbon-free sources, such as on-site solar panels.\nWater bills would also be reduced by up to 30 percent, or $97 million, through the electrification of water heating. Gas stoves and water heaters, which rely on fossil fuels, would also be replaced by electric appliances.\nThe transitioning of the U.S. public housing stock into zero-carbon, energy-efficient communities would reduce annual carbon emissions by roughly 5.6 million metric tons, according to the lawmakers.\nLow-income households on average spend 16.3 percent of their total income on energy costs, compared to 3.5 percent for other households. This can often force public housing residents to choose between paying energy bills or other expenses like health care, medicine, groceries, and childcare, according to Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez.\n“With its focus on transforming nearly 1 million units of public housing, the Green New Deal for Public Housing Act will spur economies of scale for weatherization, retrofitting, and renewable energy, making them more cost effective and livable throughout the country,” the lawmakers said.\nResidents of public housing also often suffer worse health outcomes due to mold infestations, poor indoor air quality, and unsafe temperatures. According to the National Center for Health in Public Housing, patients at primary care centers for public housing residents are more likely to be diagnosed with asthma, diabetes, depression and other mood disorders than those not living in public housing. \n“Too many families reside in public housing that has been neglected by our country’s political leaders for years, forced to choose between living in homes with toxic mold and unreliable heat, or sleeping on the street,” Varshini Prakash, executive director of Sunrise Movement, said in a statement.\nA report by the Climate + Community Project, a climate policy initiative launched by the University of Pennsylvania’s McHarg Center in 2020, found that the proposed legislation would cut asthma rates by an estimated 18 to 30 percent in New York City’s public housing. Improved environmental quality and new on-site health clinics and services would create better health outcomes for public housing residents, according to the group.\nThe bill would also create up to 240,000 union jobs per year across the country, according to the Climate + Community Project.\n“The Green New Deal for Public Housing includes opportunities for residents to finally gain access to promised jobs, while improving their quality of life and planning for climate resilience,” Wanda Salamán, executive director of Bronx-based social justice organization Mothers on the Move, said in a statement.\nThe Green New Deal for Public Housing Act is co-sponsored in the Senate by Sens. Elizabeth Warren, D-Massachusetts, Ed Markey, D-Massachusetts, and Jeff Merkley, D-Oregon, and has been endorsed by 20 organizations. In the House, the bill has 22 co-sponsors."

    "title": "Van Hollen, Sasse revive bill to protect U.S. intellectual property from foreign theft",
    "content": "Sens. Chris Van Hollen, D-Maryland, and Ben Sasse, R-Nebraska, have introduced a bill that would impose harsh penalties on companies and individuals found guilty of stealing American intellectual property. Their bipartisan Protecting American Intellectual Property Act requires sanctions for people and firms that “engage in, benefit from, or enable the significant and serial theft of U.S. intellectual property.” The measure singles out China for its “routine” theft of U.S. trade secrets. “Some foreign companies are working overtime, often in coordination with and at the direction of their governments, to steal cutting-edge U.S. technology,” Van Hollen told Capital News Service. “This theft of trade secrets threatens American jobs and businesses and compromises our national security. We must take swift action to stop these malign actions.” “Given the Senate’s unanimous passage of our bill last Congress, we will be working quickly to get this done,” the senator said.Sasse said in a statement that the bipartisan legislation is a “no-brainer.” “We have to do more to protect American intellectual property from hackers and cheaters,” Sasse said. “Stealing our IP is routine for China’s thieves  getting serious about combating their actions by using tough economic tools, like sanctions, is a good place for us to start.” The legislation would require a presidential report to Congress within six months, and then annually, that identifies individuals and firms who “knowingly engaged in, or benefitted from, significant theft of trade secrets of United States persons” and that poses “a significant threat to the national security, foreign policy, or economic health or financial stability of the United States.” The president would have the power to impose on violators sanctions ranging from prohibiting exports to banning banking transactions. After the bill’s unanimous Senate passage in December, the House failed to act before Congress adjourned.Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in an interview Sunday with 60 Minutes on CBS that China had recently acted more aggressively abroad and was behaving increasingly in adversarial ways.He said the reported theft of hundreds of billions of dollars or more in U.S. trade secrets and intellectual property by China has given the current administration “real concerns.” He said the theft sounds like the actions of someone whos trying to compete unfairly and increasingly in adversarial ways.”“But were much more effective and stronger when were bringing like-minded and similarly aggrieved countries together to say to Beijing: This cant stand and it wont stand,' Blinken said.The administration announced Friday that China has fallen short on its commitments to protect American intellectual property in the “Phase 1” U.S.-China trade deal negotiated between former President Donald Trumps administration and Beijing. The sweeping deal included regulatory changes on agricultural biotechnology and commitments to purchase some $200 billion in U.S. exports over two years. According to the 2017 report from the Commission on the Theft of American Intellectual Property, intellectual property theft costs the economy hundreds of billions of dollars each year, and China is “the world’s principal IP infringer.”"

    "title": "NASA&#8217;s Goddard Space Flight Center set to launch next-gen telescope in October",
    "content": "NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland is planning to put a new deep-space telescope into operation in October. The James Webb Space Telescope will replace the Hubble Telescope and have greater capabilities to see farther into the universe than was previously possible.\nGoddard began the telescope project in 1996 and originally aimed to launch it into space in 2007. But the complex instrument ran into design and technical issues, prolonging final development by over a decade. \nWith the delays, costs also soared. Originally a $500 million telescope, the Webb is now estimated to be close to $10 billion, according to a January 2020 Government Accountability Office report.\nConstruction concluded in 2016 and the telescope and its components have been undergoing testing. The Webb is finally set to launch on Oct. 31, according to NASA.\nDelays are inevitable with projects of such scale, but there are no more holdups expected, Dr. Daniel Weisz, associate professor of astronomy at the University of California Berkeley, told Capital News Service.\n“Thats basically how any major space mission goes,” Weisz said. “And the milestones now are really all positive, the odds of it being delayed from this year are really, really low.”\nNASAs James Webb Space Telescope is assembled for the first time in 2019 at Northrop Grumman in Redondo Beach, California. (Chris Gunn/NASA)\nThe telescope will be launched on a heavy-lift space launch vehicle, called an Ariane 5 rocket, from the European Space Agency’s Guiana Space Center in French Guiana. Weisz said the components of the telescope will start shipping to South America in August.\nThe Webb’s main mission is to expand on the discoveries of the Hubble. Launched into low-Earth orbit in 1990, the Hubble has helped scientists understand more about the formation of the Earth, other planets and the solar system. It also has peered closely at planets found in other solar systems. The telescope also has contributed to astronomers’ knowledge of the formation and evolution of stars.\nThe new telescope  named after James Webb, the NASA administrator who oversaw the early years of planning the Apollo manned moon missions  is going to provide the world’s astronomers more deep-space knowledge than ever before.\nWeisz said the Webb will be orbiting Earth out past the moon, essentially giving it a clear view of space.\n“You can put James Webb way out there and the technical part is that there is a gravitational stability that it can orbit, but really it’s way out there and it’s much more efficient that way,” Weisz explained. “It can observe all the time, the Earth blocks Hubble for large parts of the day where James Webb is going to be operating 24/7.”\nDr. Begoña Vila, an instrument systems engineer for the James Webb Space Telescope at Goddard, said the telescope will serve as “an observatory for scientists around the whole world.”\n“In fact the observations from all the submissions for the General Observers Program have just been selected, including examples of all the awesome science James Webb Space Telescope will give us,” Vila said.\nThe Webb telescope will be able to see back in time 13.5 billion years to discover new information on the first stars and galaxies ever formed. \nThe Webb’s infrared technology also will allow astronomers to view the faintest details in space history, according to Vila.\nCloser to home, the telescope will be used to observe planets, moons and other terrestrial objects within our own solar system. \nThe James Webb Space Telescope team assembles next to a full-scale model of the telescope in 2005 at the Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. (NASA)\nSince the universe is constantly expanding, the light emitted from objects in space is moving further away from Earth. This also means that astronomers must observe light through dense clouds of dust. Webb will be able to penetrate that dust.\nThere are many different materials on the telescope that will allow it to function in the unforgiving space environment.\n“Many of those materials have been chosen because they behave well and are stable at the very cold temperatures James Webb operates, around 40 K (-388 F),” Vila said.\nJust getting the complex telescope into space will be an impressive feat, Vila said.\nThe fully-deployed Webb is the size of a tennis court, much larger than Hubble. But it weighs less. \nThe new telescope has to be folded to fit into the spacecraft, and then unfolded once in space. Vila admitted that procedure makes him and other scientists nervous.\n“The ability to launch into space a telescope of this size that needs to be folded to fit inside the launch vehicle and deployed once on orbit will be a great achievement and demonstration for future missions,” Vila said.\nWeisz said he hoped the public could appreciate the years of effort that scientists have put into the telescope and the payoffs that are coming.\n“We are talking about one telescope that’s doing all these things that Hubble scratched the surface, and now we have this whole bigger, modern machine that’s going to take that little bit that Hubble did and blow it way up,” Weisz said.\nGoddard has been working with many international space organizations in order to finish the Webb project, including the European Space Agency and the Canadian Space Agency. \nThe primary contractor throughout the project has been Northrop Grumman Aerospace Systems. The Space Telescope Science Institute will operate as mission control for the Webb telescope after launch."

    "title": "Biden: &#8216;America is on the move again&#8217;; wants $2 trillion to aid families",
    "content": "In his first address to a joint session of Congress, President Joe Biden on Wednesday urged Congress to pass a nearly $2 trillion plan to help American families  spending that would build on his administration’s efforts during his first 100 days in office to end the coronavirus pandemic and restore the American economy.  \nVice President Kamala Harris and Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi made history as the first women, next in line to the presidency, to occupy the two prominent seats on the dais behind Biden. \nAfter inheriting “a nation in crisis,” Biden told the Congress that a day shy of his 100th day in office, “America is on the move again. Turning peril into possibility. Crisis into opportunity. Setback into strength.” \nOnly 200 members of Congress viewed the address in-person due to COVID health and safety regulations. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin III stood in for the rest of the cabinet, while Supreme Court Justice John Roberts represented the high court. The House chamber normally holds about 1,600 people.\nThe nationally televised Biden speech mixed reminders of what his presidency already has tried to achieve with calls to go bigger  and spend bigger  on a host of new programs.\nThe centerpiece of Biden’s address was a proposed “American Families Plan,” which would expand pre-K education by two years and make community colleges free; provide affordable child care to lower- and middle-income families; allow up to 12 weeks of paid family and medical leave, and extend a series of tax credits and tax cuts for millions of families.\n“When this nation made 12 years of public education universal in the last century, it made us the best-educated and best-prepared nation in the world,” Biden said, adding “the world is catching up. They are not waiting.” \nTo pay for his plan, the president has proposed increasing the tax rate for the top 1% of earners back up to 39.6%. It was lowered to 37% by former President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans in 2017.\n“I will not add to the tax burden of the middle class of this country. They’re already paying enough,” Biden said. “What I’ve proposed is fair. It’s fiscally responsible. It raised the revenue to pay for the plans I’ve proposed that will create millions of jobs and grow the economy.”\nBiden’s speech also asked Congress to pass legislation on police reform, just one week after former Minnesota Police Officer Derek Chauvin was found guilty on three charges stemming from the murder of George Floyd last year in Minneapolis.\n“We have all seen the knee of injustice on the neck of Black America,” Biden said. “Now is our opportunity to make real progress.”\nThe George Floyd Justice in Policing Act passed in the Democratic-led House in March and is awaiting action in the Senate. \nThe president also repeated his call for lawmakers to pass election reform and voting rights laws, both of which are being resisted by the GOP.\n“More people voted in the last presidential election than ever before in our history – in the middle of one of the worst pandemics ever,” Biden said. “That should be celebrated. Instead it’s being attacked.”\nA bill to protect the rights of LGBTQ Americans also must get to his desk, Biden said, adding that he wanted transgender people to know “the president has your back.”\nIn support of the right to unionize, Biden called on the members of Congress to pass the Protecting the Right to Organize (PRO) Act. He also urged them to pass the $15 minimum wage and the Paycheck Fairness Act, which would ensure equal pay for women. \nThe president reiterated his determination to pass a $2 trillion infrastructure package, which he called “a blue-collar blueprint to rebuild America” and the greatest job plan since World War II.\nHe said he welcomed Republican ideas on infrastructure spending, but warned “doing nothing is not an option.”\nBiden said he wanted to expand cancer research, a topic close to Biden’s heart, as his late son, Beau Biden, died from brain cancer in 2015. He said the National Institutes of Health should embark on a massive effort to create a new center focused on breakthroughs for preventing and treating diseases including not only cancer but also Alzheimer’s and diabetes.  \n“I can think of no more worthy investment. And I know of nothing that is more bipartisan,” the president said. “Let’s end cancer as we know it. It’s within our power.”\nBiden also urged Congress to tackle a host of issues that have eluded resolution for years: stricter gun laws, reform of immigration laws and lowering prescription drug costs.  \nWhile Democrats generally applauded the president’s proposals, Republicans were highly critical.\n“Our president seems like a good man. His speech was full of good words,” Sen. Tim Scott, R-South Carolina, said in the official Republican response.\n“Our nation is starving for more than empty platitudes,” he said. “We need policies and progress that bring us closer together.”\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, called Biden’s speech a “bait and switch.”\n“The ‘bait’ was he was going to be a moderate, a unifying force and bring us all together,” the senator said. “The ‘switch’ is that Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vermont, for all practical purposes, won the debate in the Democratic Party over what it ought to look like.”\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-California, tweeted after the address: “This whole thing could have just been an email.”\nBut House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Mechanicsville, called Biden’s speech “an agenda of justice, equality, security, and opportunity.”\nI was glad to hear President Biden set out his vision and call our country to the higher purpose of living up to the promise of its Founders: that all our people must not only be treated equally under our laws but that all equally deserve a chance to make it In America,” Hoyer said.\nPelosi characterized Biden’s remarks as a “unifying message of resilience, resolve and hope.”\n“The Democratic Congress looks forward to working with the Biden-Harris administration to enact this historic vision for lower health care costs, for bigger paychecks, for cleaner government, for the people,” the speaker said. \nSen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Maryland, praised the president’s address, saying Biden “spoke to the country with confidence and conviction; seriousness and resolve; realism about the challenges we face; and optimism about America’s future.”\n“The best way to face these challenges is together. President Biden has already worked to bridge the divides of this nation, and we must forge ahead,” Van Hollen said.\nBiden began his address by marking his administration’s progress in the first 100 days in fighting the pandemic.  \n“After I promised 100 million COVID-19 vaccine shots in 100 days, we will have provided over 220 million COVID shots in 100 days,” Biden said. “Our progress these past 100 days against one of the worst pandemics in history is one of the greatest logistical achievements our country has ever seen.”"

    "title": "Listeria outbreak in Mexican-style soft cheese prompts recall",
    "content": "An ongoing listeria outbreak in fresh, soft cheeses threatens 26 states on the East Coast and the Midwest, with at least four positive cases and one death in Maryland, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nThe source is believed to be a New Jersey-based company called El Abuelito Cheese Inc., which has recalled several varieties of its Mexican-style soft cheeses.\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration warned El Abuelito Cheese about the possibility of a listeria outbreak in a June 2020 letter after inspections revealed food safety violations at the company’s plant.\n“During our inspection, FDA investigators found serious violations,” the FDA’s letter stated. The agency’s inspection had found non-harmful types of listeria but warned the cheese company that the presence of any type of listeria meant that conditions were ripe for listeria monocytogenes, which causes disease in humans.\n“Listeria monocytogenes is a known or reasonably foreseeable hazard for cheese,” the FDA’s letter explained. “Sanitation controls are generally applied to prevent contamination… and environmental monitoring for listeria species is usually used to verify these controls.”\nEight months after the FDA issued its warning letter, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention first published reports about a possible listeria outbreak in soft cheeses, listing seven known cases between October 2020 and February 2021. At the time, the precise source of the outbreak was unknown, but investigators had already found a possible link to Hispanic-style fresh and soft cheeses.\n!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var e in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var t=document.getElementById(\"datawrapper-chart-\"+e)||document.querySelector(\"iframe[src*='\"+e+\"']\");t&&(t.style.height=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][e]+\"px\")}}))}();\n\nBy Feb. 16, Connecticut’s Department of Public Health had discovered a possible connection between El Abuelito Queso Fresco cheese and the listeria outbreak, which was announced by the CDC the next day.\nOnce this connection was confirmed, El Abuelito issued a recall for all queso fresco cheeses products with sell-by dates through Mar. 28, including those sold under the brand names El Abuelito, Rio Grande and Rio Lindo.\nBy the end of February, El Abuelito had expanded its recall to all queso fresco, quesillo, or requeson cheeses produced at the contaminated facility, according to the CDC’s timeline.\n\n? #Recall Alert ?\nEl Abuelito Cheese has recalled more cheese amid a listeria outbreak that has sickened 10 people.\nHeres what you need to know: https://t.co/uIjz1YxkCx\n— Consumer Reports (@ConsumerReports) March 5, 2021\n\nEleven cases of listeria infections  10 resulting in hospitalizations  were recorded by the CDC at this point: four cases in Maryland, four in New York, two in Virginia and one in Connecticut. In Maryland, there had been one death reported to the CDC.\nThe phone number provided by El Abuelito on the recall press release on the FDA website has been disconnected.\nWhen the company was contacted by a different number, an employee who answered the call stated that the company is no longer producing cheese, and requested a phone number. There has been no further contact with El Abuelito.\n﻿\nListeria on its own is generally not a significant cause of illness in the United States, according to Dr. Martin Wiedmann, co-director of the New York Integrated Food Safety Center of Excellence and professor of food safety at Cornell University.\nListeria infections primarily affect pregnant women, newborns, older adults, and people with weakened immune systems, according to the CDC.\nIn the United States, there are only about 1,600 known cases per year, but around 90% of those people end up in the hospital, Wiedmann said.\n“Listeria is one of those organisms that generally causes severe disease,” including septicemia, which is blood poisoning, and meningitis, which is an infection of the brain, he said.\nWiedmann added that about a fourth of the listeria cases involving pregnant women cause abortions, between 300 and 400 annually.\n\nLove queso fresco or other soft cheeses? If you are #pregnant, skip the soft cheeses and other foods made from unpasteurized milk. These foods can put you at a higher risk for Listeria infection. https://t.co/zLMiJALPr5 pic.twitter.com/Fo0XuhRb24\n— foodsafety.gov (@foodsafetygov) April 6, 2021\n\nThe best way to avoid listeria infections, according to the CDC, is to:\n# Avoid raw sprouts\n# Avoid smoked fish\n# Avoid cut melons that have been left at room temperature for more than four hours\n# Avoid hot dogs, pâtés, lunch meats, and cold cuts that have not been cooked to an internal temperature of 165℉ or have been in the refrigerator longer than two weeks\n# Avoid unpasteurized dairy products and soft cheeses such as queso fresco, queso blanco, brie and Camembert\n# Keep the refrigerator temperature lower than 40℉ and the freezer lower than 0℉\n“Use separate knives, utensils and boards for raw food versus cooked foods,” Wiedmann cautioned. “Don’t use the same spatula to put your burgers on the barbecue and then take off the finished burger, because you’re cross-contaminating it… Keep your food cold or keep it really hot. If its somewhere in the middle, it gets dangerous. Thats particularly important for listeria, because listeria can grow at refrigeration temperatures.”\nFor more information about avoiding a listeria infection, see the CDC’s  Questions and Answers page about listeria.\nFor more information about the El Abuelito listeria outbreak, see the CDC’s webpage called “Listeria Outbreak Linked to Queso Fresco Made by El Abuelito Cheese Inc.”"

    "title": "Cardin seeks to extend relief payments to farmers, ranchers and self-employed",
    "content": "Sen. Ben Cardin, D-Maryland, and a half dozen Democratic and Republican colleagues have proposed legislation that would allow farmers, ranchers and sole proprietors of businesses to apply retroactively for increased coronavirus relief payments.\nThe original Paycheck Protection Program signed into law on April 24, 2020, allocated $484 billion for forgivable loans to businesses to offset lost revenue during the COVID-19 pandemic. The program was extended late last year and the Small Business Administration is offering loans through May 31.\nMany small businesses were not able to take full advantage of previous PPP loans because the calculations were based on their net income, decreasing their benefits. The changes Cardin and his fellow senators are proposing would allow a recalculation of loans based on gross income, retroactive to March 27, 2020.\n“The Biden administration has taken steps to make PPP more useful to farmers, ranchers, and sole proprietors, so making the changes retroactive is a matter of basic fairness,” Cardin said in a statement. “Congress must pass this bill as quickly as possible so eligible small businesses have time to secure the aid they need before PPP closes on May 31.”\nMany of the senators co-sponsoring the bill represent states where farming is a major segment of their economies. Farmers and ranchers also stepped up during the pandemic to ensure food supplies were not interrupted, the lawmakers noted.\nSen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wisconsin, said in a statement that “it’s important that we continue our work across party lines and pass this legislation now so our hard working farmers and small businesses have the support they need to get past this economic crisis and move forward.” \nSen. Roger Marshall, R-Kansas, said that many farm and ranch partnerships were not eligible to receive the benefits that came from changes the SBA made in December.\n“When it comes to PPP, we must ensure no farmers or ranchers are left behind, and I am pleased to join my colleagues on this important legislation,” Marshall said.\nOther co-sponsors include Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, Sen. James Lankford, R-Oklahoma, Sen. Angus King, I-Maine, and Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio.\nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, and chairwoman of the House Small Business Committee, has introduced a similar bill in the House.\nThe American Farm Bureau Federation, the nation’s largest agriculture organization, has been pressing for changes to the PPP.\nBefore Cardin and the other senators proposed their bill, the Farm Bureau’s congressional relations director, Emily Buckman, said in March that the SBA “has been denying loans to self-employed farmers and ranchers who operate in a partnership, or as sole-owner LLCs.”\nIn many ways, this denial has caused picking winners and losers among those who are self-employed,” Buckman said."

    "title": "Senate approves bill aimed at combating hate crimes against Asian Americans",
    "content": "On a nearly unanimous vote, the Senate Thursday passed legislation aimed at speeding federal investigations of hate crimes against Asian Americans related to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n“Passing the Covid-19 Hate Crimes Act sends a clear and unmistakable message of solidarity to the (Asian American-Pacific Islander) community,” said Sen. Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, who introduced the bill last month. “This moment would not be possible without the collective efforts of so many people including my Republican colleagues.” \nThe Senate vote to pass the hate crimes bill was 94-1, with Missouri Republican Sen. Josh Hawley the lone opponent. The legislation now goes to the House for a final vote, which is likely next month, according to Rep. Grace Meng, D-New York, sponsor of an identical House bill. \nPresident Joe Biden supports the legislation.\n“Today, the Senate said enough is enough, and underscored loud and clear that there is no place for hate anywhere in our society,” Meng said in a statement after the Senate vote. “More reporting of hate crimes will provide us with increased data and a more accurate picture of the attacks that have been occurring against those of Asian descent, and a more centralized and unified way of reviewing these crimes would help to address the problem in a more effective manner.”\nIn addition to speeding federal probes of hate crimes against Asian Americans, the measure directs the Department of Justice to provide state and local law enforcement agencies with guidelines for establishing hate crimes reporting systems in multiple languages. The Justice Department and the Department of Health and Human Services also would work with community groups to eliminate discriminatory language in materials related to the pandemic. \nWithin the past few months, the country has seen a startling rise in the number of cases of violence against Asian Americans, including the March 16 shooting of six Asian American women in Atlanta. \nResearch released by Stop AAPI Hate, a nonprofit group, revealed nearly 3,800 incidents were reported over the course of roughly a year during the pandemic.\nVerbal harassment and shunning were the most common types of discrimination, making up 68.1 percent and 20.5 percent of the reports, respectively, the group found. The third category, physical assault, made up 11.1 percent of the total incidents. More than a third of incidents occurred at businesses, while a quarter took place in public streets.\nDespite Congress, human rights groups, the press and social media taking notice of these hate crimes now, this is not a recent phenomenon, said author William Ming Liu.\nLiu compared the situation to how the frequent video recording of police violence on Blacks caused people to think it’s a recent phenomenon. \n“People are much smarter and more willing to record these things, but in terms of overall violence and abuse, thats always been there,” Liu said in an interview with Capital News Service.\nTiffany Chang, director of community engagement for Asians Advancing Justice, said an annual increase of 150 percent in hate crimes is an incredibly shocking number considering that the country has been in a pandemic. She said that many of the victims were likely people simply going out for supplies or were essential workers.\nThe anti-Asian rhetoric used by former President Donald Trump as the pandemic intensified was a key factor in encouraging hate crimes and discrimination against Asian Americans, Chang and other researchers said.\n“There was a press conference with footage of him crossing out the word ‘coronavirus’ on his talking points and writing in ‘China virus,’ as if to deliberately stoke animosity against Asians and Asian Americans, Chinese Americans in particular,” Chang said.\nThis scapegoating gives people who are angry at the state of affairs created by the pandemic an outlet, she added. \nIt doesn’t help that there are so few Asian Americans in the higher levels of government, said Jonathan Law, an organizer for Baltimore Asian American Resistance, which seeks to address systemic problems facing Asian-Americans.\nAccording to Chang, Asian Americans have been trying to protect themselves by sticking closely together. Families have been telling their grandparents and parents not to go out alone or to ask someone to run their errands for them. \nChang’s Asians Advancing Justice have been working with another activist group to provide free, online bystander intervention training to anyone who wishes to learn practical techniques to help someone being attacked or harassed in public. \nChang said that of the 30,000 people trained, nearly 100 percent have said they were confident that they could do something if they saw harassment occurring.\nAlthough Liu is glad to see so many Asian Americans come together on this, he said he wishes he saw more of a multicultural coalition against hate crimes and discrimination.\n“Theres nothing worse for someone who believes in white supremacy to see a multi-racial coalition protecting themselves,” Liu said."

    "title": "House passes DC statehood, Senate prospects dim",
    "content": "House Democrats passed legislation Thursday that would grant statehood to the District of Columbia. The 216-208 party-line vote sends the measure to the Senate, where it does not appear to have the necessary 60 votes to pass.\nThe Washington D.C. Admission Act, symbolically numbered H.R. 51, would create Washington, Douglas Commonwealth, with two senators and a representative in the House, totaling three electoral college votes.\n“Statehood for D.C. is about fairness, justice, and ensuring that all Americans have an equal stake in our republic,” the House Oversight and Reform Committee’s chairwoman, Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-New York, said in her closing remarks. “This is not about politics. It’s a fundamental voting and civil rights issue.”\nThe bill was authored and introduced by the District’s Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton, who has been leading the movement for statehood for decades. The bill has 216 House co-sponsors; an identical piece of legislation passed in the House last year.\nNorton, who first introduced the bill 10 years ago with no co-sponsors, has argued continuously that District residents pay more in state and federal taxes than other states but have no voting representation in Congress.\n“Congress has both the moral obligation and the constitutional authority to pass H.R. 51,” Norton said. “This country was founded on the principles of no taxation without representation and consent of the governed, but D.C. residents are taxed without representation and cannot consent to the laws under which they, as American citizens, must live.”\nHouse Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Mechanicsville, said statehood was a civil rights issue and a matter of equality of citizenship.\n“In no other democratic nation in the world, does the capital city of that nation not have a vote in their parliament,” Hoyer said. “Now our ‘parliament’ is called the Congress.”\nRepublicans called the bill unconstitutional. They also were upset over the implications of an overwhelmingly Democratic city adding two Democratic senators to a closely-divided Senate.\nRep. James Comer, R-Kentucky, said the bill attempted to ignore the Founding Fathers’ intent for the capital, adding that statehood would be an unconstitutional, impractical and blatant power grab.\n“America’s government will become of the Democrats, by the Democrats, and for the Democrats,” Comer said. “H.R. 51 is all about the Democrats adding two new progressive U.S. senators to push a radical agenda… to reshape America into the socialist utopia they alway talk about.”\nRep. Pat Fallon, R-Texas, offered “retrocession” as an alternative, giving District residents full federal representation. Putting the District “back into Maryland would give them that added seat and would address that very issue.”\n“The GOP is acting in good faith because we know that seat will be a Democratic seat, but its the right thing to do,” Fallon said.\nRep. Mondaire Jones, D-New York, rebutted Republicans’ arguments, saying: “There is no good faith argument for disenfranchising over 700,000 people, most of whom are people of color.”\nThe White House voiced its support for District statehood on Tuesday, issuing a policy statement saying that it “will make our Union stronger and more just” and calling on Congress to give the residents of the nation’s capital “long overdue full representation in Congress.”\nIn the Senate, Democrats and Republicans are divided 50-50, with Vice President Kamala Harris holding a tie-breaking vote. The problem for District statehood, as it is for many other matters before the Senate, is that it would require 60 votes to end an expected filibuster by GOP opponents.\nNo Republican senator so far has embraced District statehood. And some Senate Democrats have not said how they would vote on the idea.\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-New York, is expected to press for a vote on District statehood. After the House vote, he tweeted: “This is about democracy. It’s about self-government. It’s about voting rights. I was proud to re-introduce this bill in the Senate, and we are working to make #DCStatehood a reality.”\nSen. Tom Carper, D-Delaware, and the chief statehood sponsor in the Senate, has asked former Connecticut Sen. Joe Lieberman to help lobby undecided senators to vote for the House-passed bill, Forbes reported.\nBut Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, told the magazine there was “zero chance” he could be persuaded by his close friend Lieberman to end his vehement opposition to statehood.\nThe League of Women Voters urged the Senate to pass the bill.\n“D.C. statehood is not a partisan issue but a civil rights issue which cannot be separated from the fight for racial justice,” League CEO Virginia Kase said in a statement. “As D.C. is a jurisdiction with a majority population of Black and Brown people, continued efforts to block full representation is discrimination against the people who live, work, and pay taxes in the District.”\n“For decades, Congress has refused to vote on statehood, based on racist accusations that D.C. cannot govern itself,” she said. “ It is long past time that we dispel these racist and discriminatory excuses and deliver justice to the residents of our nation’s capital.”"

    "title": "National Cherry Blossom Festival’s new art exhibit still blooming in DC area",
    "content": "The annual National Cherry Blossom Festival ended this month, but the festival’s new community-wide visual arts exhibition is sticking around through at least Memorial Day.\nOrganizers created the “Art in Bloom” exhibit — 26 oversized cherry blossom sculptures painted by local and national artists — to give visitors the opportunity for an in-person cherry blossom experience, despite access to the trees being restricted this year amid the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe sculptures have been placed in locations around Washington, Maryland and Virginia. Some sites hope to keep the sculptures permanently displayed.\nAbout 130 artists responded to the festival’s call for applications in January, and 25 were selected after submitting their design ideas. The artists were invited to work on their sculpture in a Washington studio. Fiberglass sculptures were provided as a canvas.\nOne of the selected artists, Sandra Pérez-Ramos of Silver Spring, Maryland, said her sculpture “Celebration” focuses on the transition to spring and new beginnings.\n“We needed a dose of joy and hope after this last winter and after a COVID-19 pandemic year,” Pérez-Ramos, 45, told Capital News Service.\n“Celebration” has a variety of colors and shapes, such as hearts, dots and spirals. The colors used have a spring theme, such as blue, green, yellow and pink.\nShe said she made the base of the sculpture bright white and worked around the sculpture’s organic shape. “A lot of those elements that I used in my work — spirals, dots, little lines and hearts — are playing with the shape of the flower, like sort of enhancing and making it look expanded,” Pérez-Ramos said. \nSince the festival had to follow pandemic safety protocols, the artists were divided into two groups, and each group had a week in the provided studio to complete their sculpture. Pérez-Ramos said she completed her work in about 35 hours.\nAnother artist, Steve Rands of Mechanicsville, Maryland, chose to work in his own shop, and spent two weeks completing his piece.\nRands, 45, didn’t use one of the provided fiberglass sculptures, instead making his own from metal.\nRands’ sculpture, “MXY-7,” is unpainted and shaded darker than most other sculptures, especially where Rands used a torch.\n“MXY-7” got its name from a Japanese kamikaze plane that means cherry blossom.\n“A lot of the other work I’ve done has kind of had a military aviation theme because I’m a retired military pilot,” Rands said. “When I was looking for a name for it I wanted something with kind of a blossom or flower name in it.”\nOrganizers knew they needed to expand the festival’s footprint this year after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic forced the festival online in 2020.\n!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var e in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var t=document.getElementById(\"datawrapper-chart-\"+e)||document.querySelector(\"iframe[src*='\"+e+\"']\");t&&(t.style.height=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][e]+\"px\")}}))}();\n\n“As soon as this festival was over last year, we knew that we needed to plan several scenarios,” said Diana Mayhew, president of the National Cherry Blossom Festival. “We planned three different scenarios, we had no idea what was going to happen.”\nPart of the finalized plan included the “Art in Bloom” exhibit, which is an effort to still give visitors a physical cherry blossom experience, while avoiding crowds and following COVID-19 safety guidelines.\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends avoiding large gatherings, especially those where it’s impossible to maintain a six-foot distance from others.\nThe National Park Service limited vehicular and pedestrian access to the Tidal Basin, East Potomac Park and West Potomac Park during the peak bloom period of the cherry blossoms, according to the National Park Service’s website.\n“Working with the Park Service, the best thing to do was restrict that visitation to the trees,” Mayhew said. “We couldn’t have hundreds of thousands of people coming, it wouldn’t be the right timing to have that happen.” \nThe art exhibit allows people to filter in and out of Washington and surrounding areas, as opposed to hundreds or thousands of people trying to look at the trees in the same area at the same time.\nGet out and see the sculptures while you can, because they might not be there next year. “I don’t think we’ll do the art sculpture every year. It’s a very costly program, but we will bring it back in a few years for sure,” Mayhew said.\nThe festival is selecting one photo entry per week now until May 31 to win a $25 Amazon gift card. If you follow @cherryblossfest on Instagram or Twitter, upload your original photo of a sculpture with a caption, hashtag #ArtInBloom and tag @cherryblossfest, you could be selected."

    "title": "Anti-abortion bills on the rise among state legislatures",
    "content": "Republican state legislators across the country are introducing increasingly restrictive anti-abortion bills in the hopes of sending a case through the conservative-majority Supreme Court and possibly overturning Roe v. Wade. \nOver 500 abortion restrictions have been introduced in state legislatures this year, according to a report by the Guttmacher Institute. Compared to the same time in 2019, 300 abortion restrictions had been introduced, of which 59 were enacted. In 2020, there was less of a focus on abortion among state legislatures. Of the 236 abortion restrictions introduced, 27 were enacted. \nThe latest anti-abortion bills are also more restrictive, such as a measure that recently passed in Arkansas and signed into law by Gov. Asa Hutchinson, a Republican. The law is an almost complete abortion ban, allowing the procedure only to save the life of the mother. It does not allow any exceptions in situations of rape or incest.\n“It is not constitutional under Supreme Court cases right now,” Hutchinson said on CNN’s State of the Union on March 21, referring to the law he signed. “I signed it because it is a direct challenge to Roe v. Wade.\nIf Roe v. Wade were to be overturned or weakened, abortion access would be at risk in 24 out of 50 states, according to Elisabeth Smith, chief counsel for state policy and advocacy at the Center for Reproductive Rights. \n\nArkansas, Idaho, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Dakota, Missouri, Tennessee, South Dakota, and Utah are all states with “trigger bans.” Trigger bans are automatic abortion bans within the state should Roe v. Wade be overturned. \n“This lack of access would force those seeking an abortion to travel hundreds of miles, in some cases across multiple state lines, in order to receive care,” Smith told Capital News Service.\nThese abortion restrictions would have particularly harsh consequences for those who already face systemic barriers to healthcare, including people of color, people living in rural areas, those struggling to make ends meet, young people, and those in abusive relationships, Smith said. \n“Wealthy women will always find a way. They will have the resourcesbut poor women will not,” Dr. Laura Meyers, CEO of Planned Parenthood Metropolitan District of Columbia, told CNS. “So of course, these laws disproportionately affect poor women.” \nTexas is also looking to pass a trigger ban. The bill, which was passed by the Texas Senate on March 30, would prohibit almost all abortions. \n“This is not about discriminating against women. This is about giving the unborn a chance to live,” Texas State Sen. Eddie Lucio Jr., the only Democrat to co-sponsor the bill, said during a March 30 hearing.  \nThe bill would also make it a criminal offense for doctors to perform abortions. Those who perform abortions once the law goes into affect could be fined up to $100,000. In comparison, those who commit sexual assault are fined $10,000 under Texas law.\nAnother piece of anti-abortion legislation passed by the Texas Senate on March 30 would ban abortions once the fetus has a heartbeat, which is usually detected around six weeks into a pregnancy. Texas State Sen. Bryan Hughes, a Republican and lead author of the bill, said it is hard to argue with the fact that life begins with a heartbeat. \n“Texas is a pro-life state and this legislation reflects our continued commitment to protecting the most vulnerable,” Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, a Republican, said in a statement. “I look forward to this lifesaving legislation being signed into law.”\nThe bills were advanced by a Texas House committee on April 15 and now go to the full House for debate.\nStates are also pushing anti-abortion constitutional amendments, Smith said. \nAt the start of this year, the Kansas legislature placed a constitutional amendment on the Aug. 2022 ballot that explicitly says the state constitution does not recognize a right to abortion. Iowa, Kentucky, and Oklahoma also moved to create ballot initiatives meant to restrict abortion rights.\nAccording to Meyers, these laws would have devastating effects on people, especially from a health perspective. If abortion were to somehow be banned, people would still find a way to seek an abortion, including self-administered abortions.\n“Rather than eliminating abortion, what you’re doing is making abortion unsafe,” Meyers said. \nA Pew Research Center poll in 2019 found that 70 percent of women do not support overturning Roe v. Wade, and 69 percent of men do not. A majority of Americans are more concerned that states are making it too difficult (59 percent) than too easy (39 percent) to get an abortion. \n“There are no other circumstances where state legislatures and politicians step in to restrict access to healthcare,” Meyers said. “Can you imagine if a state started to step in to restrict access to appendectomies, or other life-saving care?” \n“Abortion is health care. Abortion care is health care,” Meyers added. \n\nDespite the polls, many Republicans remain firm in their pro-life policies. Joshua Wilson, a University of Denver political science professor, credits this largely to the partys white, evangelical following.\nThe Christian right, Wilson said, consistently has turned out voters, volunteers, and leaders for the Republican Party.\nAlthough white evangelicals are only 15 to 20 percent of the population, they have made up approximately one quarter of the electorate for every presidential and mid-term election since 2012, according to data from the Public Religion Institute.\nWhite evangelicals are also deeply invested in fighting against abortion. A 2019 Pew Research Center public opinion poll on abortion found that 77 percent of white evangelicals believed abortion should be illegal in all cases, the most anti-abortion opinion by any Christian religious group by far. The second closest was Catholics, at 42 percent.\nIn the face of the vast amount of abortion restrictions being introduced in state legislatures, New Mexico is one of the only states to recently decriminalize abortion.\nThe Respect New Mexico Women and Families Act, signed into law by New Mexico Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, repealed New Mexico’s 1969 statute that criminalized abortion with few exceptions. \n“A woman has the right to make decisions about her own body,” Grisham said in a statement. “Anyone who seeks to violate bodily integrity, or to criminalize womanhood, is in the business of dehumanization.”"

    "title": "Lawmakers want to expand role of hospitals in preventing violence",
    "content": "A Maryland lawmaker and a Republican colleague are proposing legislation that would expand the role hospitals play in preventing violent crimes.\n“One of the leading factors for violent injury is prior injury,” one of the bill’s sponsors, Rep. Dutch Ruppersberger, D- Timonium, said. “If we can help victims of violent injury before they become repeat victims or ever perpetrators themselves, we end the cycle and net a cost savings to the American taxpayer.”\nRuppersberger and Rep. Adam Kinzinger, R-Illinois, introduced legislation that would provide close to $10 million through federal grants to help hospitals expand or create programs to help patients who are recovering from injuries caused by violent crime. It is similar to legislation the pair sponsored in the last Congress and was passed in the House.\nExpenses ranging from police, courts, jails, and medical costs to the lost wages from victims and perpetrators cost taxpayers across the country more than $42 billion annually, Ruppersberger said. \nThe bill takes inspiration from the model currently employed at the University of Maryland Shock Trauma Center in Baltimore, which gives participants counseling and a full range of support, including money for public transportation, substance abuse treatment, job training and affordable housing.  \nRuppersberger said close to 20 percent of all patients at the center are victims of violence in Baltimore, such as stabbings or shootings.\nKinzinger said mental health issues are rising across the country along with acts of violence, and victims are often caught in an ensuing cycle of violence. He said this legislation provides the opportunity to support victims with the education and resources to pursue a different path.\n“Right now, it’s important we work together to help and heal those who are struggling,” he said. “The Bipartisan Solution to Cyclical Violence Act is a perfect example of how we can join forces and enact policies that will have a real and lasting impact in our communities.” \nRuppersberger said that patients who participated in the Baltimore program saw an 83 percent decrease in re-hospitalization due to intentional violent injury, 75 percent decrease  in criminal activity, and 82 percent rise in employment following completion.\nThe legislation has been endorsed by numerous organizations, including the American College of Surgeons. \nThe college’s executive director, Dr. David Hoyt, said that violence is a public health crisis that disproportionately affects the nation’s most vulnerable citizens and contributes to health disparities across the country.\n“Violence prevention services have been shown to improve patients’ recovery and decrease the risk of re-injury,” Hoyt said. “(Hospital-based violence intervention programs) have demonstrated success and value by mitigating the risk factors associated with violence and significantly reducing violent injury recidivism.” \nPresident Joe Biden’s proposed jobs and infrastructure plan offers over $5 billion to support community-based violence prevention programs, although the allocation of the funding is not yet finalized.\nWhite House Domestic Policy Council Director Susan Rice told NPR on April 1 that the administration decided to raise funding for violence prevention programs to help communities who have been struggling for years without the necessary resources. \n“The epidemic of violence, in our cities particularly, is horrific and growing,” she said.\nThe money is included in the infrastructure plan, Rice said, because the goal of the package is to make sure Americans have the infrastructure to compete and succeed\nIf passed, the legislation proposed by Ruppersberger and Kinzinger would require the health and human services secretary to choose the hospitals for the federal grants among existing and potential violence prevention programs. After three years, those hospitals would report their findings to the federal government. \nThe legislation is awaiting a hearing before the House Committee on Energy and Commerce. \n“This bill is also critical to our efforts to shift social work away from police and first responders, and back to the experts in mental health, substance abuse, homelessness, unemployment and other areas that often afflict victims of violent crime,” Ruppersberger said."

    "title": "In Washington, Chauvin guilty verdict is call to pass police reform measures",
    "content": "After a jury on Tuesday found former Minneapolis Police Officer Derek Chauvin guilty of murdering George Floyd, President Joe Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris and Democratic congressional leaders saw the verdict as a call to enact new laws against nationwide police brutality.\n“Because of smartphones, so many Americans have now seen the racial injustice that black Americans have known for generations,” Harris said in a nationally televised address from the White House’s Cross Hall.\n“Here’s the truth about racial injustice: its not just a Black America problem or a people of color problem,” Harris said before Biden spoke. “It is a problem of every American, it is keeping us from the promise of liberty and justice for all.”\nBiden repeated Floyds last words, I cant breathe.\nWe cant let those words die with him, the president said. We have to keep hearing those words. We must not turn away. We cant turn away.\nThis can be a moment of significant change, Biden said.\nAttorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement that while the state’s prosecution was successful, I know that nothing can fill the void that the loved ones of George Floyd have felt since his death.\nHe said the Justice Department’s civil rights probe into Floyd’s death “is ongoing,”\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-California, said in a press conference from the Capitol that the verdict was a “step in the right direction.”  Pelosi thanked the jury for validating what she and the world saw on tape.\n“George Floyd should be alive today,” she said on Twitter. “His family’s calls for justice for his murder were heard around the world. He did not die in vain. We must make sure other families dont suffer the same racism, violence  pain, and we must enact the George Floyd #JusticeInPolicing Act.”\nThat legislation passed the House in March and now awaits action in the closely divided Senate.\n“This bill would hold law enforcement account and build trust between law enforce and our communities” Harris said.\nHouse Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Mechanicsville, urged the Senate to pass the reform bill.\n“But we can only do so much by legislation alone,” he said. “Our nation must reckon with racial bias and with the reality that, even 158 years after President Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation, America is still not free from the legacy of slavery, segregation, and institutionalized racism. Justice, equality, and opportunity are still being denied to Black Americans, and we must all confront this painful truth.”\nMajority Leader Chuck Schumer D-New York, said that the trial served to affirm what many people were already aware of, that Floyd had been murdered in cold blood. But Schumer said that the verdict alone did not end the rampant problem with police conduct in the country.\nThe divide between law enforcement and the communities they are supposed to protect have not yet been bridged, Schumer said.\n“We must remain diligent in our efforts to bring meaningful change to police departments across the country,” Schumer said. “The Senate will continue that work as we strive to ensure George Floyd’s tragic death will not be in vain.”\nSen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Maryland, also urged action on the police reform bill named after Chauvin’s victim.\n“While today’s verdict was just, we must think of the Black Americans who have never received justice,” Van Hollen said in a statement. “We must move with urgency to confront and defeat systemic racism in all its forms, and Congress must act immediately to pass the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act.”\nSen. Ben Cardin, D-Maryland, said that the reform measure includes additional provisions that prohibit the “use of racial and religious profiling by police” and changes how law enforcement interacts with marginalized communities.\n“As a nation, we simply must do more to ensure that the basic human rights of Americans are protected at all times, even if they are suspected of a crime,” Cardin said. “We also must fundamentally reform our thinking and systems so that individuals are not assumed suspects because of the color of their skin or the clothes they wear. It’s morally wrong and a waste of legitimate police resources.“\nMaryland Attorney General Brian E. Frosh also called for further action both nationally and locally.\n“Justice has been done,” Frosh said. “But this cannot be the end. Systemic problems with policing and with equal justice require reform.”\nSen. Cory Booker, D-New Jersey, tweeted that “this verdict is justice served  but it is not justice for George Floyd.”\n“True justice would be a country where George Floyd would still be alive today,” the senator said. “True justice demands action  it demands change  that we do everything we can to stop this from happening again  again  again.”\nFloyd was killed on May 25, 2020, during an arrest made by four Minneapolis police officers, including Chauvin, who knelt on Floyd’s neck and back for 9 minutes and 29 seconds, resulting in his death.\nChauvin’s trial began March 29. The jury found him guilty on two counts of murder and one count of manslaughter.\nFollowing the verdict, Biden and Harris called the Floyd family. Biden comforted the family, saying the trial would be the start of change.\nAdvocacy groups, while noting that the verdict was a sign of justice, still continue to fight for other issues. The NAACP website acknowledged that “the jury has spoken, but our lives are still on the line.” A link to a petition for police reform followed the statement.\nWe will never begin to achieve true justice for George Floyd until our country completely transforms public safety to save Black lives and reduce racist police violence, the American Civil Liberties Union said on Twitter."

    "title": "Chesapeake Bay, southern Maryland could see new federal park, heritage designations",
    "content": "The Maryland congressional delegation is pushing legislation to protect and enhance the natural resources throughout southern Maryland and the Chesapeake Bay area with new federal park and heritage designations.\nDemocratic Sens. Ben Cardin and Chris Van Hollen, both of Maryland, and Rep. John Sarbanes, D-Towson, have mounted a bicameral effort to form a working group that would explore designating the Chesapeake Bay region as a national recreation area. This group would be made up of lawmakers and more than 30 regional organizations.\nEfforts to protect the nation’s largest estuary have been floating around for decades.\nIn his 1984 State of the Union Address, then-President Ronald Reagan said he regarded the Chesapeake Bay as a “productive recreational area and a special national resource.”\n“Marylanders know the Chesapeake Bay is a national treasure,” said Van Hollen, who is leading the working group effort. “Designating a Chesapeake National Recreation Area will highlight that reality – and bring national recognition to the importance of the Bay and its natural, cultural, historical, and recreational significance.”\n“This is also a unique chance to bring new resources to protecting the Bay and to generate new opportunities to grow Maryland tourism and outdoor recreation,” he said.\nPlaces designated as national recreation areas were initially spaces surrounding reservoirs. Now, the concept has expanded to offer visitors opportunities to experience more than just water-based outdoor activities.\nGolden Gate Park in San Francisco is a national recreation area, an urban waterfront space that includes the former penitentiary on Alcatraz Island, the Sutro Baths ruins and the Presidio of San Francisco.\nThe Oregon Dunes National Recreation Area on the Oregon coast features the nations largest coastal sand dunes. Visitors can drive off-road vehicles, camp or bird-watch.\nNational recreation areas also often include significant natural and cultural elements.\nChesapeake Conservancy President and CEO Joel Dunn applauded the efforts of the lawmakers heading the project.\n“A Chesapeake National Recreation Area would be a land-based, 21st century park, uniting new and existing National Park Service sites and trails, as well as partner parks, to increase public access to the Bay and to create a national park-worthy visitor experience for all to enjoy,” he said in a statement.\nDunn also said a Chesapeake NRA would bring economic benefits to the region.\n“Along with protecting natural, cultural, and historic resources and connecting people to nature, national parks have a proven, positive economic impact on surrounding local economies,” he said. “A Chesapeake National Recreation Area would strongly support the Bay region’s outdoor recreation economy, which contributes billions of dollars annually through recreation and tourism activities.”\nThe Working Group is set to collaborate in the coming months over proposed legislation that eventually would lead to creating a new Chesapeake National Recreation Area.\nThere are 40 designated NRAs nationwide and are among the most visited sites in the National Park System.\nCardin also is working with House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Mechanicsville, on legislation that would designate portions of four southern Maryland counties – St. Mary’s, Calvert, Charles and Prince George’s – as a new National Heritage Area.\nThe goal would be to “further commemorate, conserve and promote important natural resources,” according to Hoyer.\nNational Heritage Areas (NHAs) are designated by Congress as places where natural, cultural and historic resources come together to form a cohesive, nationally important landscape, according to the National Park Service.\nNHA entities typically collaborate with communities  in this case that would be the four Maryland counties  to determine how the area’s heritage can be made relevant to local interests and needs.\nShould the Chesapeake Bay area receive formal recognition from the National Park Service, it would be federally managed. NHAs differ in that they typically remain in state, local, or private management.\nVan Hollen was an original cosponsor of the heritage legislation.\n“Southern Maryland has a vast array of natural, historical, and cultural sites,” Van Hollen said. “Designating a Southern Maryland National Heritage Area will help more Americans appreciate and experience all it has to offer, while bringing more federal funding to support and conserve this vital region of our state.”\nSouthern Maryland is rich in history.\nSt. Mary’s City, for example, was the state’s first European settlement and capital. And it is considered to be the birthplace of religious freedom in the United States because it is where the Province of Maryland passed “An Act Concerning Religion” in 1649.\nThe proposed heritage area is also home to numerous other historical sites, Civil War battlegrounds and popular hiking trails.\n“This legislation will provide the federal funding needed to enhance conservation efforts, fuel local economic growth, and support our communities,” Hoyer said.\nThe legislation authorizes $10 million in appropriations. Of that amount, no more than $1 million would be used in any fiscal year, with a limit on the maximum federal contribution of 50% of costs associated with the heritage area."

    "title": "House committee passes DC statehood bill",
    "content": "A House panel on Wednesday approved a bill granting statehood to the District of Columbia, setting the stage for a full House floor vote as early as next week.\nAfter hours of debate, the House Oversight and Reform Committee voted 25-19 along party lines to send the symbolically numbered H.R. 51 to the House, where a similar measure passed last year.\nThe Washington, D.C. Admission Act not only would make the District the 51st state, but also would name the state Douglass Commonwealth, give it two  U.S. senators and a representative in the House and award it three electoral votes for presidential elections. \n“The United States is the only democratic country that denies both voting rights in the national legislature and local self-government to the people of its capital,” the panel’s chairwoman, Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-New York, said. “That is wrong. It violates everything we stand for as Americans.” \nThe bill was introduced earlier this year by Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton, a Democrat and Washington’s non-voting House member, who has been an outspoken supporter of statehood for the nation’s capital.\n“Congress can no longer exclude D.C. residents from the democratic process, forcing residents to watch from the sidelines,” Norton told the committee. “Democracy requires more. D.C. residents demand much more.”\nRep. Jamie Raskin, D-Kensington, argued that the country is disenfranchising District voters by not giving the city’s 712,000 residents representation in Congress.    \n“The Constitution is not a straight jacket, its a freedom document,” Raskin said. “Its about making sure all citizens can participate on the plane of political equality.” \nRaskin, attempting to find a middle ground with Republican committee members, suggested making Puerto Rico and the District states at the same time.\nReps. James Comer, R-Kentucky, and Jody Hice, R-Georgia, called the bill unconstitutional and a ploy by the Democratic Party to gain two more Democratic senators. \n“There is zero chance that this bill will pass judicial review,” Comer said. “The courts know better, the Senate knows better.”\nComer proposed an amendment to the bill, calling for a repeal of the 23rd Amendment, which allows District residents to vote for the president and vice president. Without repealing that amendment first, Comer said, the nation’s capital would technically have six electoral votes. \nThat sparked a heated debate between Raskin and Hice about disenfranchisement of voters, particularly people of color, and about the controversial voting law passed by the Georgia state legislature in March.\n“You don’t disenfranchise the people you don’t agree with, but that has become the M.O. of our friends across the aisle,” Raskin said.\nRep. Byron Donalds, R-Florida, also questioned the bill’s constitutionality.\n“We are making a gross, political assumption because we don’t want to deal with the Constitution first,” Donalds said.\nIf, as expected, the House approves the District statehood bill, it faces a more difficult path in the closely divided Senate. Even though the Democrats control the majority there with 50 votes plus Vice President Kamala Harris, statehood would require 60 votes to pass."

    "title": "Biden to withdraw troops from Afghanistan starting May 1, ending by Sept. 11",
    "content": "President Joe Biden announced Wednesday he will begin withdrawing U.S. troops from Afghanistan on May 1, completing a full withdrawal by Sept. 11, the 20th anniversary of the 2001 terrorist attacks.\nIm now the fourth United States president to preside over American troop presence in Afghanistan. Two Republicans, two Democrats. I will not pass this responsibility on to a fifth, Biden said Wednesday during a  televised speech in the White House’s Treaty Room. Ive concluded its time to end Americas longest war. Its time for American troops to come home.\nHe added that the United States would not take our eye off the terrorist threat” in Afghanistan or anywhere else following the withdrawal.\nWe will reorganize our counter-terrorism capabilities and the substantial assets in the region to prevent the re-emergence of terrorist threat to our homeland over the horizon,” Biden pledged. “Well hold the Taliban accountable for its commitment not to allow any terrorist to threaten the United States or its allies on Afghan soil. The Afghan government has made that commitment to us as well, and well focus our full attention on the threat we face today.\nBiden said the reasons for keeping U.S. troops in Afghanistan are becoming “increasingly unclear” and that since he visited the country as vice president, he has believed that only “the Afghans have the right and responsibility to lead their country.”\nThe president said significant humanitarian and development assistance” will be maintained in order to protect Afghan women.\nBiden had been facing a May 1 withdrawal deadline negotiated in Doha, Qatar, last year by the Trump administration with the Taliban.\nAdministration officials have said the withdrawal effort will be coordinated between the United States and North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) allies and will not be conditions-based.\nBiden’s September withdrawal has been met with objections from some top leaders in the Pentagon and the intelligence community, who warned U.S.-backed local forces won’t be able to withstand Taliban violence without certain capabilities provided by the Americans.\nBiden’s move drew both criticism and praise from Capitol Hill.\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, attacked the decision on the Senate floor Wednesday, saying Biden was taking “the easy way out of Afghanistan” and the likely result would be “disaster.”\n“If this administration wants a successful legacy on the world stage, if they want accomplishments that will endure, they need to put American strength back at the center and come back to the bipartisan mainstream,” McConnell said.\nSen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, told reporters that terrorist groups must be jubilant: “In their world, they beat us.”\nThere should be a residual U.S. force in Afghanistan, he said. By ignoring that advice from various experts, he told the president “this is on you, this is not on the military.”\nBut Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, said leaving Afghanistan “should not be taken as a sign that America will be any less vigilant in protecting American lives and those of our allies, but we can do so without a permanent military presence in a hostile terrain.\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-California, said the withdrawal was “an important and welcomed development.”\n“I support this transition and President Biden’s leadership to protect the safety of our troops and the security of the American people, which must be our priority,” Pelosi said in a statement.\nHouse Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Mechanicsville, said the withdrawal is “the right decision.”\n“More than 2,300 American service-members and more than a thousand serving in allied Coalition forces made the ultimate sacrifice in Afghanistan,” the Maryland lawmaker said. “The previous approach of maintaining thousands of U.S. military personnel in Afghanistan has not led to a resolution, and a new approach is required.”\nThe chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, Rep. Adam Smith, D-Washington, said he concurred with Biden “that we cannot wait for the perfect security conditions before withdrawing – to do so would mean our men and women in uniform would never return home.”\n“Our goal in the region,” Smith said in a statement, “has always been to prevent transnational terrorists from launching an attack against the United States or our allies, but there are other means to monitor that threat and manage risk and, at this point, the cost and risk of a continued troop presence – both US troops and those of our allies – outweigh the benefits.”\nThere are officially 2,500 U.S. troops currently in Afghanistan as well as 1,000 more special operations forces. There are also up to an additional 7,000 foreign forces there, the majority of them NATO troops.\nThen-President George W. Bush deployed the first U.S. soldiers to Afghanistan shortly after the 2001 terrorist attacks. Biden said he spoke to his predecessor on Tuesday.\nWhile he and I have had many disagreements over policy throughout the years, were absolutely united in our respect and support to the valor, courage and integrity of the women and men of the United States armed forces who have served, Biden said."

    "title": "Pandemic upends usual procedures in adoptions and foster care",
    "content": "Before COVID-19 hit, children and youths in the foster care system met with their biological families periodically as dictated by a court. But amid the pandemic, such visits switched to online meetings.\nNot all children adapted well to the change, according to officials. Even as Maryland changed pandemic restrictions and some agencies like the Baltimore City Department of Social Services returned to in-person visits, the experience has remained very different.\nUnder pandemic safety guidelines, the children and their biological families must stand six feet apart, their masks covering the lower part of their faces. Hugging is not allowed.\nThat can be hard to explain to the children, especially for those who are new to the foster care program, said Stephanie King, manager of the therapeutic foster care program at the Kennedy Krieger Institute.\n“If I were a family and my child was in care and I couldn’t lay my hands on them, that would break my heart,” she said.\nRELATED: A LOOK AT A FAMILYS JOURNEY TO ADOPTION DURING THE PANDEMIC\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has forced departments of social services and foster care programs across the nation to adapt. But for many children and youths who rely on stability, there is still a lot of disruption, experts say.\nCongress last December passed a bipartisan COVID-19 relief bill, which included $400 million for foster care programs affected by the pandemic. Maryland received over $3 million in February.\nThe legislation also expanded financial support to those in foster care: instead of children aging out at age 21, the new cut-off is 27.\n“There really shouldnt be a kid under the age of 27, who is in foster care at some point, struggling at all right now,” Ruth White, executive director of National Center for Housing and Child Welfare, told Capital News Service.\n\nA majority of the children at the Kennedy Krieger Institute, a Baltimore-based non-profit that has a therapeutic foster program, are identified as having been neglected or abused, King said.\nIn the city of Baltimore, there are currently 1,904 children and youth in foster care, according to Baltimore City Department of Social Services.\nIn Marylands largest city, as in the nation, most foster children eventually are reunited with their biological families or with relatives. The others are adopted.\nThe situations that send children into foster care vary, King said. Some have experienced some level of trauma; others have special needs that parents can’t meet, such as medical conditions; still others may be dealing with family drug or alcohol abuse, financial stresses or housing issues — all problems that the society at large is struggling with, King said.\nKing stressed that such kids need to have a sense of stability.\nThe foster family becomes a support system for the biological families, she said. And programs like hers encourage foster parents, especially as the time for a child to go home gets closer, to be really engaged so that the biological parents are prepared to take care of the child.\nWhile the ultimate goal of foster programs is to return children to their biological families, if that’s not possible, efforts still are made to maintain a connection between them. And that has been harder to do during the pandemic.\nThe courts determine how often children in foster care may be in contact with their biological families. That may be weekly, bi-weekly or monthly. Some children may be barred from contacting their families at all. And these visitations can be either supervised or unsupervised, depending on court orders.\n\nAfter the pandemic began, the Baltimore City Department of Social Services created a special team to support family providers and foster parents.\nIn-person visits resumed July 1, except for those at higher risk of contracting COVID-19 or those over 65.\nFor many kids, especially those with significant developmental disabilities or who are younger, an online environment isn’t the same, King said. It may be hard for them to understand what is happening.\nThere also have been times when families needed to be tested for COVID or suffered deaths from the disease, King said. Sometimes, these emergencies mean that a foster child could no longer go to a certain foster family.\nLegislation in Congress aims to strengthen foster care programs. Introduced in March by Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Missouri, and Rep. Brenda Lawrence, D-Michigan, the bills would amend the Social Security Act to ensure that children and youths entering foster care receive mental health screenings and assessments.\nThe bills would require states to provide such screenings within 30 days of entering foster care systems. Those found to require mental health care would get a “comprehensive health assessment” within 60 days. Yearly screenings also would be required.\n“Children in foster care are much more likely to struggle with issues like depression, anxiety, and PTSD,” Blunt said in a statement. “With data showing an alarming decline in outpatient mental health services for children across the country, this is a critical time to ensure that foster children do not fall through the cracks.”"

    "title": "Biden administration takes aim at improving Black maternal health care",
    "content": "Marking Black Maternal Health Week, the Biden administration is moving to put more federal resources behind improving Black maternal health care.\n“Make no mistake. Black women in our country are facing a maternal health crisis,” Vice President Kamala Harris said at a virtual roundtable she hosted in Washington Tuesday. “Black women are two to three times more likely to die in connection with childbirth than other women.” And Black women are also more likely to lose healthcare coverage during their pregnancy, she said. \nThe United States currently has the highest maternal mortality rates among developed countries  17.2 deaths per 100,000 live births, according to the American Journal of Managed Care. \nThese rates are even higher among Black women in the United States, regardless of their income and education levels: 37.1 deaths per 100,000 live births, according to the Commonwealth Fund.\n“We know the primary reasons why: systemic racial inequities and implicit bias,” Harris said. “And the consequences of both are very real.” \nInequities in housing, transportation and nutrition all work together to negatively affect Black maternal health, the vice president said.\nThe Biden administration is asking Congress to approve spending $200 million to implement implicit bias training for healthcare providers and strengthen current programs focused on maternal care, including Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP).\nThe administration also is requesting a 24 percent hike for the United States Department of Health and Human Services Office for Civil Rights and a 19 percent increase for the federal family planning program to advance health equity and access to health services. \nThe administration also is proposing to spend $6 billion to support low-income women and children under the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC).\nIn addition, the Health Resources and Services Administration is going to make available $12 million for maternal health care in rural communities. \nLastly, the Department of Health and Human Services approved a waiver for Illinois to allow the state to extend postpartum coverage to all pregnant women under Medicaid beyond 60 days and up to 12 months. It is the first of what are expected to be many such waivers.\nHouse Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Mechanicsville, said in a statement that systemic health inequities have been made even worse by the coronavirus pandemic.\nA founding member of the Black Maternal Health Caucus, Hoyer praised the White Houses efforts to address the issue.\nWe must build on these efforts to root out bias in medical services, improve access to key reproductive and preventative health services for all women, and expand access to quality health care in hard-to-reach communities, the Maryland lawmaker said.   \nBlack mothers at the roundtable shared personal experiences with life-threatening pregnancies, bereavement and apathetic care from physicians. A common sentiment that the mothers shared throughout their pregnancies were feelings of being dismissed and not being listened to or heard by their health care providers.  \nHeather Wilson was diagnosed with preeclampsia during her pregnancy, a condition that worsened towards the end of her term. She lost her first child, Kennedy. \n“In the aftermath, we struggled to pick up the pieces without direction, support and resources,” Wilson said. “I felt so alone.” \nWilson is the executive director and founder of Kennedys Angel Gowns, a non-profit based in Virginia Beach, Virginia, created in memory of her lost baby. The organization provides families with handcrafted burial gowns for their babies, “angel gowns,” which are sewn from pieces of donated wedding gowns. \nWilson said that each week, her organization helps up to 10 families bury their babies, a striking number that she called “unreal.” \nThrough her work at the organization and as a bereavement doula, Wilson helps raise awareness about pregnancy loss and provides families with the support and resources to assist them through the grieving process.  \nErica McAfee suffered two pregnancy losses. She was diagnosed with preeclampsia during her first pregnancy and experienced cervical insufficiency during her second pregnancy. Her third pregnancy was successful, despite having to undergo eight blood transfusions and a partial hysterectomy at the age of 28. \n“I knew that there were other Black women who experienced the traumatic birth or pregnancy complications like me and I wanted to hear their stories  I wanted to amplify their voices through podcasts,” McAfee said.\nMcAfee is the founder and CEO of Sisters in Loss, a digital media platform providing comfort to grieving Black mothers by replacing their “silence with storytelling.” \n“For every maternal death, over 100 women experience a severe complication related to pregnancy and childbirth  something we call severe maternal morbidity,” said Dr. Elizabeth A. Howell, head of the Department of Obstetrics  Gynecology at the Perelman School of Medicine. \nSevere maternal morbidity affects 50,000 women in the United States, according to Howell. And 60% of maternal deaths are preventable, she added.  \nHarris said she had heard many stories over the years of poor treatment of Black women by the health care system. \n“Black women deserve to be heard,” the vice president said. “Their voices deserve to be respected. And like all people, they must be treated with dignity.”"

    "title": "Biden takes actions aimed at curbing gun violence &#8216;epidemic&#8217;",
    "content": "President Joe Biden took a half dozen steps Thursday aimed at reducing gun violence, his first efforts to address the issue as other gun measures are stalled in Congress.\nThe president also announced he was nominating a gun-control advocate, David Chipman, as director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. If confirmed, he would be the first confirmed director of the agency since 2015.\n“Gun violence in this country is an epidemic, and it’s an international embarrassment,” the president said in the White House Rose Garden.\nThe president’s moves came in the wake of two mass shootings — one on March 16 in Atlanta, where eight people were killed, and the other on March 22 in Colorado, where 10 lives were lost.\nHouse Democrats also have pushed to pass gun-reform bills, but the measures face uncertain fates in the Senate. Reforming gun laws was a key theme in Biden’s presidential campaign and was a major focus of his legislative work during his decades in the Senate.\n“Whether Congress acts or not, Im going to use all the resources at my disposal as president to keep the American people safe from gun violence,” Biden told an audience that included prominent gun control advocates, families of gun violence victims and lawmakers sponsoring gun safety measures.\nMore than 19,000 people died in gun-related incidents in 2020, according to the nonprofit Gun Violence Archive. An additional 24,000 people took their own lives with guns.\nOne of Biden’s actions is directed at curbing the proliferation of “ghost guns”  guns that lack serial numbers and can’t be traced by law enforcement. Such weapons allow criminals to readily purchase and use them in a short amount of time.\nThe president directed the Justice Department to close the regulatory loophole that has made so-called “buy-build-shoot” kits easy to acquire without background checks.\nBiden also is seeking to limit access to stabilizing braces, tools which can turn a pistol into a short-barreled rifle. Within 60 days, the Department of Justice will issue a rule making pistols with arm braces subject to the same regulations governing rifles.\nAlso at the president’s direction, the Justice Department will publish within 60 days model “red flag” legislation to prevent “individuals in crisis” from having access to firearms. Some states have passed red flag laws, which give family members and law enforcement the ability to obtain court orders barring certain people deemed at risk of harming themselves or others from getting weapons.\nIn addition, Biden said the Justice Department will begin collecting more comprehensive data on firearms trafficking, report its findings and provide annual updates  the first time such information has been analyzed in two decades.\nFinally, the administration will be channeling federal money to help community programs that target urban violence.\n“Gun violence is not a problem that law enforcement alone can solve,” Attorney General Merrick Garland said, speaking after Biden.\nSen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Maryland, called Biden’s moves a “step in the right direction.”\n“It’s past time for the Congress to act on gun safety reform,” Van Hollen said in a statement. “To stop this senseless violence, we must enact national, common-sense policies that meaningfully address this crisis, and we must have dedicated leadership at ATF that is committed to tackling this epidemic.”\n House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Mechanicsville, said the White House was showing a “serious commitment to protecting Americans from gun violence.”\n“The acts of gun violence weve seen in the past few weeks make it clear that the threat posed by guns has not diminished, and we must not go back to a time when mass shootings and rampant gun violence were a norm to which many had grown accustomed,” Hoyer said in a statement.\nThe House has passed legislation to expand background checks for gun buyers, but most Republicans in the closely divided Senate appear opposed to such measures.\nBiden nevertheless called on senators to pass that legislation.\n“Theyve offered plenty of thoughts and prayers  members of Congress  but they’ve passed not a single new federal law to reduce gun violence,” the president said. “Enough prayers. Time for some action.”\nHe also urged lawmakers to renew the Violence Against Women Act, enact a new assault weapons ban and outlaw high-capacity magazines, and change the laws that shield gun makers from lawsuits.\nSen. Chris Murphy, D-Connecticut, and a prominent gun-control advocate, praised Biden’s efforts and was optimistic about future prospects for gun law changes.\n“The NRA’s influence is fading, the gun violence prevention movement is stronger than ever, and the prospect to pass lifesaving legislation that is supported by more than 90% of Americans has never been better,” Murphy said in a statement.\nNicole Hockley, who founded Sandy Hook Promise after her son Dylan was killed in the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School mass shooting, said in a statement that the president’s steps were the first in a larger process of gun-law reforms.\n“We need our senators to step up and take bipartisan action to expand background checks,” she said. “The future of our families and communities depend on this simple, life-saving legislation.”\nSen. Pat Toomey, R-Pennsylvania, said in a statement he was reviewing the president’s proposals and said he appreciated the president’s willingness to work with both Republicans and Democrats on gun legislation.\n“If done in a manner that respects the rights of law-abiding citizens, I believe there is an opportunity to strengthen our background check system so that we are better able to keep guns away from those who have no legal right to them,” Toomey said.\nBut House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-California, tweeted that Biden was attempting “to trample over our constitutional 2A rights by executive fiat.”\n“He is soft on crime, but infringes on the rights of law-abiding citizens,” McCarthy charged. “I won’t stand for it. And neither will House Republicans. Follow the Constitution!\nThe National Rifle Association tweeted that Biden’s White House event was a “circus.”\n“These actions could require Americans to surrender lawful property, push states to expand confiscation orders, and put a gun control lobbyist to head ATF,” the NRA said.\nSen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, said in a tweet “the answer is not to restrict the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding citizens.”\n“The answer is to go after violent criminals and come down on them like a ton of bricks,” he said.\nBiden anticipated such criticisms in his remarks.\n“No amendment to the Constitution is absoluteYou cant yell fire in a crowded movie theater and call it freedom of speech,” the president said. “From the very beginning, you couldnt own any weapon you wanted to own. From the very beginning that the Second Amendment existed, certain people werent allowed to have weapons. So the idea is just bizarre to suggest that some of the things were recommending are contrary to the Constitution.”\n“This is not a partisan issue among the American people,” Biden said."

    "title": "Biden faces pressure to address May 1 Afghanistan withdrawal deadline",
    "content": "President Joe Biden is facing pressure to decide whether to abide by the May 1 deadline negotiated by the Trump administration to fully withdraw remaining U.S. troops from Afghanistan. Despite initially hinting interest in meeting the May deadline, President Biden has since conceded that an estimated 2,500 troops could still be in Afghanistan after the deadline. In a March 16 interview with ABC News, Biden said it would be tough to meet the May deadline, adding that it was not “a very solidly negotiated deal.” He added that even if the United States did not meet the deadline, American troops will not be in Afghanistan much longer. White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki on Tuesday acknowledged the difficulty of meeting the tight schedule: “First, it wasn’t a deadline we set.”But she reminded reporters that as vice president, Biden “spoke out about his concerns about the war” during the Obama years even when that was not a dominant view.“So that should hopefully give people confidence about his commitments,” Psaki said. “But its also an important decision  one he needs to make in close consultation with our allies and also with our national security team here in this administration. And we want to give him the time to do that.”The May 1 goal stems from an agreement negotiated between the Trump administration and the Taliban signed in Doha, Qatar in February 2020. The deal would see a total withdrawal of troops from the country nearly 20 years after the U.S.-led invasion. In exchange, the Taliban would sever ties with al-Qaida and end attacks on American forces. The Afghan government, led by President Ashraf Ghani, was left out of negotiations. Since the accord, the Taliban has stepped up violence in the country, expanding its control and influence. Despite this, leaked State Department documents obtained by the New York Times in late February outlined Biden’s proposal for a political settlement, calling for replacing Afghanistan’s current government with temporary leaders, the drafting of a new constitution, and securing a cease-fire. However, Ghani has said the only way to form a government is through an election. “I advise those who go to this or that gate to gain power is that political power in Afghanistan has a gate, and the key is the vote of the Afghan people,” Ghani said at the opening of the parliament session in Kabul on March 6.Ghani offered a three-step peace plan at the Heart of Asia conference on March 30 in Tajikistan’s capital, Dushanbe, that includes the possibility of an election. The plan has since been rejected by the Taliban, which insists the Doha agreement is the “best plan.” In addition, the Taliban has confirmed a meeting with Gen. Scott Miller, the head of U.S. forces and the NATO-led non-combat Resolute Support mission and diplomat Zalmay Khalilzad, where “both sides expressed their commitment to the Doha agreement and discussed its full implementation.” Top-ranking U.S. officials and many on Capitol Hill believe a total withdrawal by May 1 will be unlikely. Sen. Robert Menendez, D-New Jersey, and chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, is among a group of congressional Democrats urging Biden to reconsider the agreement, citing the Taliban’s violation of the deal and the poor chances of creating a viable peace agreement between the Taliban and the Afghan government. “No one wants to bring our sons and daughters home as much as I do, but I also don’t want to have shed so much blood and national treasure and see it fall back into chaos,” Menendez said during a March 9 press conference.But others in Congress are pressing the White House to stick to the withdrawal timeline. In a March 18 letter to Biden, Reps. Barbara Lee, D-California, and Ken Buck, R-Colorado, said meeting the May 1 deadline was “vital.” “We believe that continued diplomatic engagement with all parties to the Afghanistan conflict, including women and civil society groups, as well as carefully tailored assistance programs, are essential to the success of the peace process,” the lawmakers said. “But it is long past time for the United States to end its military role in a complex conflict that predates our initial invasion two decades ago.”The U.S. presence in Afghanistan dates back to the U.S. invasion Oct. 7, 2001  less than a month after the deadly terrorist attacks of Sept. 11. There are currently an estimated 3,500 American troops as well as 7,000 NATO and allied troops who depend on U.S. forces for logistics and protection. For Marvin Weinbaum, the director of Afghanistan and Pakistan Studies at the Middle East Institute, a dignified American departure would entail an interim arrangement where the United States could justify leaving by saying it did all it could for Afghanistan and finding a permanent solution is up to that nations government. “We won’t wipe our hands of Afghanistan, but certainly militarily, we will find no reason to be there,” Weinbaum told Capital News Service. The main concern for Afghanistan is the possibility of a civil war if U.S. and NATO forces pull out without a peace deal, as the Taliban has already threatened to target those troops if the withdrawal deadline is missed.Weinbaum said the current initiative is based on a lot of moving parts and it will be a difficult process to bring them together. “The hard part comes when the Taliban and the Afghans, again, even if its not specifically the government, have to sit down and negotiate the terms of an interim government if they could never agree on a constitution for a permanent government,” he said. The Afghanistan Study Group, established by Congress in 2019, issued a Feb. 3 report that urged the Biden administration to seek an extension of the withdrawal deadline.The peace talks “will not succeed as long as the United States declares itself willing to withdraw its forces regardless of how much or how little progress is made during the negotiations,” the bipartisan group warned.“The United States is in a position where effective diplomacy, modest continuing aid levels, and strong coordination across civilian and military lines of effort against a clear and unified objective can create the conditions for a responsible exit from Afghanistan that does not endanger our national security,” the group’s report said. “The opportunities presented by this position must be exhausted before more radical alternatives are considered.” Biden is most likely to seek a change in the troop withdrawal date and ask other nations in the region, including China and Pakistan, to convince the Taliban to agree, Max Boot, senior fellow for national security studies at the Council on Foreign Relations, wrote in February.“If the Taliban doesn’t agree to an extension (the odds are that it won’t), the Biden administration will be left with the unpalatable choices of pulling out anyway  risking a collapse of the Afghan state  or remaining embroiled in the ‘forever war,’” Boot said.Weinbaum believes the U.S. withdrawal and removal of supporting airpower would deal a devastating blow to the Afghan security forces. “We give both technical support and psychological support,” he said. “So, I would anticipate the unraveling of the security forces over a not too long period of time.”But Boot said that if the cycle of violence by the Taliban resumed but it failed to achieve its objectives, “it could eventually return to the negotiating table.”"

    "title": "Voter restrictions are being proposed in 47 states, report says",
    "content": "State legislators in 47 states have introduced 361 bills so far this year to restrict voting, according to a Brennan Center for Justice Report released Thursday.\nIn the states, legislatures are rushing to enact restrictive voting laws, the most significant since the Jim Crow era,” Brennan Center president Michael Waldman tweeted. “With the For the People Act, Congress has the power to stop that cold.”\nThe report said the state laws were being proposed and passed in response to “baseless and racist allegations of voter fraud and election irregularities.”\nRoughly 30 percent of the restrictive laws have been proposed in the last month, the center said.\nMost of the bills are aimed at cutting down on absentee voting, while almost a quarter are seeking tougher voter identification requirements, the Brennan report said.\nArizona, Georgia and Texas accounted for nearly 100 of the voting restriction bills, according to the center.\nThe report was released the same day the House Administration Committee held a hearing on voting rights and access. The panel’s chairman, G.K. Butterfield, D-North Carolina, mentioned the Brennan report in his remarks.\n“All too often, access to the ballot has been neither free nor fair,” he said.\nThe 2020 election, which had a record turnout of over 150 million people, has prompted Democrats in Congress to try to pass the “For The People Act,” which would expand voters’ rights, improve access to the ballot box and bars to reduce voter discrimination. The measure also would overhaul campaign finance laws and end partisan gerrymandering of districts.\nHouse Democrats passed the bill in March.\nRepublicans in Congress have called the bill a power grab by the Democrats.\nRep. Bryan Steil, R-Wisconsin, said the bill never had proper hearings before it was passed.\n“Republicans want to ensure that every eligible person who wants to vote is able to cast a vote,” he insisted.\nVoter discrimination has existed since the 15th Amendment guaranteeing voting rights was ratified in 1870, Butterfield said.\n“It is time we encourage people to vote, rather than continuing to erect barriers that seek to suppress the votes, and voices of communities,” Butterfield said.\nNorth Carolina remains a “battlefield” in an “unending war” for access to the ballot, Allison Riggs, co-executive director of the Southern Coalition for Social Justice, told lawmakers.\nVoter suppression can take many forms, she said: lack of access to transportation, conflicts between work and shorter polling hours, or voting places without access to people with disabilities.\nIn her written testimony, Riggs said that Black and brown voters waited longer to vote and were the targets of misinformation. Black voters faced more barriers to participate due to unreliable mail service and discrimination, she added.  \nWhile there were successes in voting turnout in many states amid the pandemic, Black and Latino voters had their absentee ballots rejected at disproportionately high rates, Riggs noted.\nCritics often focus on a specific set of jurisdictions when talking about voter suppression, such as Texas, Georgia, North Carolina and Florida, said Sonja Diaz, the director of the UCLA’s Latino Policy and Politics Initiative.\n“But this frame too often leaves out an important fact,” Diaz said. “The attack on Americans’ fundamental right to free and fair access to the ballot happens everywhere.”\nIn the presidential election of 2020, 16.6 million Latino voters cast ballots, the single largest four-year increase for that group of voters. But many new voter suppression laws are being proposed or passed in the very states where Latinos played a significant role, Diaz said.\nAnd voter barriers may have a lasting impression on first-time voters, she added.\nLast year, the states with the largest increase in voter turnout compared to the 2016 presidential election were states that expanded access to the ballot, said Marcia Johnson-Blanco, co-director of the voting rights project of the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law.\nHawaii, California and Utah all saw increases in turnout after mail-in ballots were sent to every registered voter in their states.\nIn contrast, states with more restrictive laws and barriers had the lowest turnout, Johnson-Blanco said.\nBarriers for voters included restrictive voter ID laws, cutbacks on early voting, elimination of polling places and restrictions on community-based voter registration groups, Johnson-Blanco said, adding that such laws continue to disproportionately impact voters of color.\n“Without congressional action, the 2020 election and its aftermath may become an inflection point in our nations history,” she said. “With the future being one with states providing two different voting systems: one that provides access, and one that provides stringent restrictions.”"

    "title": "Democrats in Congress pressure Biden to address student loan debt crisis",
    "content": "Democrats in the House and the Senate have introduced bills calling upon President Joe Biden to forgive student loan debt, which they argue is widening the racial and gender wage gaps and exacerbating the economic problems already worsened by the pandemic.\nStudent loan debt forgiveness could have a strong positive effect on the American economy, according to the bills’ sponsors, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-New York, and Rep. Ayanna Pressley, D-Massachusetts.\n“The student debt crisis is a racial and economic justice issue and we must finally begin to address it as such,” Pressley said in a statement. “Canceling student debt is one of the most effective ways to provide direct relief to millions, help reduce the racial wealth gap, stimulate our economy, and begin to deliver an equitable and just recovery. ”\nThe bills are supported by 58 cosponsors in the House and 16 cosponsors in the Senate, and reinforced by the protections against taxing student loan forgiveness that Sens. Elizabeth Warren, D-Massachusetts, and Bob Menendez, D-New Jersey, built into the COVID relief bill passed in early March.\n\nSome people argue that people with student loan debt are just lawyers and doctors with fancy degrees. Today expert witnesses set the record straight in the @SenateBanking Committee about why we need to #CancelStudentDebt to help working families and narrow the racial wealth gap. pic.twitter.com/ibYPmRQJci\n— Elizabeth Warren (@SenWarren) March 5, 2021\n\nBut Biden has already said publicly that he will not support the passage of these bills. While he does believe that he can forgive some student debt, he does not agree with the quantity that Schumer and Pressley are proposing.\nWhite House Chief of Staff Ron Klain told Politico Thursday that Biden has asked Education Secretary Miguel Cardona to examine the presidents legal powers to cancel student debt.\nAnd hopefully we’ll see that in the next few weeks, Klain said. And then he’ll look at that legal authority, he’ll look at the policy issues around that, and he’ll make a decision.”\nApproximately $1.7 trillion is currently owed to the government in federal student loans, according to the Federal Reserve. One decade ago, federal student loan debt was approximately $845 billion, which makes the current debt amount an increase of about 102% since 2010.\nBy removing the weight of student loans from borrowers’ wallets, debt cancellation could increase consumer spending and boost America’s economy, according to a 2018 study published by the Levy Economics Institute of Bard College, a nonpartisan public policy think tank.\n!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var e in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var t=document.getElementById(\"datawrapper-chart-\"+e)||document.querySelector(\"iframe[src*='\"+e+\"']\");t&&(t.style.height=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][e]+\"px\")}}))}();\n\nStudent loan debt has lurked in the background of American politics for several years.\nEighteen bills addressing student loan debt have been introduced since the 117th Congress convened on Jan. 3.\nMultiple past presidential candidates, including Biden, have included student loan forgiveness as an issue in their campaigns.\nIn a Medium post written during his 2020 campaign, Biden suggested that as president, he could “forgive all undergraduate tuition-related federal student debt from two- and four-year public colleges and universities for debt-holders earning up to $125,000,” as well as cancel a significant amount of student debt and expand federal student loan forgiveness plans.\nThese suggestions made it appear that Biden would support a student loan debt forgiveness plan similar to those suggested by Pressley and Schumer’s student loan forgiveness bills.\nBut Biden’s promises as president have been scaled down.\nAt a Feb. 16 CNN town hall, Biden was confronted with the student loan debt issue by an audience member, Joycelyn Fish from Racine, Wisconsin.\n“The American Dream is to succeed,” Fish said. “But how can we fulfill that dream when debt is many people’s only option for a degree? We need student loan forgiveness beyond the potential $10,000 your administration has proposed. We need at least a $50,000 minimum. What will you do to make that happen?”\n“I will not make that happen,” Biden said. He cited the theoretical graduates of schools like “Harvard and Yale and Penn,” claiming that forgiving their student loans would divert “billions of dollars” that could be spent on early education.\nBut universities like the Ivy League colleges are not the main sources of student loan debt, according to the Department of Education.\n!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var e in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var t=document.getElementById(\"datawrapper-chart-\"+e)||document.querySelector(\"iframe[src*='\"+e+\"']\");t&&(t.style.height=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][e]+\"px\")}}))}();\n\nVery few people leave universities like Harvard and Yale with student loan debt, and even fewer continue to be in debt several years later, according to the Education Department. The majority of student loans are taken out by students attending less expensive two- and four-year schools.\nMost students who borrow money for college are low- or middle-class students “who had to go into debt to access postsecondary education, and who are paying dearly for it,” Persis Yu, director of the National Consumer Law Centers Student Loan Borrower Assistance Project, wrote in a Feb. 16 article responding to Biden.\nBut Sen. John Thune, R-South Dakota, disagreed that student loan forgiveness could support “low-income or disadvantaged individuals,” saying that “higher income Americans could end up benefiting the most,” and calling the Democrats’ proposals “unfair.”\n“Yes, a number of Americans carry a significant amount of student loan debt,” Thune said. “But some of those Americans have incurred that debt for a career that will bring significant financial rewards.”\nA university degree, after all, has been shown by the Education Department to positively affect a graduate’s annual wage.\nBut the presumption that a post-degree job will be enough to pay off student loan debt may be inaccurate, according to a recent study published by the Roosevelt Institute, a liberal think tank associated with the Franklin D. Roosevelt Presidential Library and Museum. Black students are more likely to take on debt to finance their education, but are less likely to graduate or see the benefits of a degree on their post-college wages, the study argues.\nPressley was one of the thousands of college students who defaulted on their student loans.\n\nThe student debt crisis is a racial and economic justice issue—and one that is deeply personal to me.\nWe must #CancelStudentDebt.https://t.co/Mt23hDOkj0\n— Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley (@RepPressley) February 21, 2021\n\n“Like 85% of Black students, I had to borrow; and like so many of those students, I also defaulted on those loans, Pressley said. “Decades of systemic racism and discriminatory policies like redlining and predatory lending systematically denied Black and Latinx families the opportunity to build wealth, forcing our families to take on greater rates of student debt, just for the chance at the same degree as our white counterparts.”\nHilary Shelton, director of the NAACP Washington Bureau, said in a statement that “at too many junctures in our country, the African American community and other communities of color have been shut out from real economic opportunity, relief and support.”\n“Now, the student debt crisis is worsening existing economic disparities,” he said.\n!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var e in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var t=document.getElementById(\"datawrapper-chart-\"+e)||document.querySelector(\"iframe[src*='\"+e+\"']\");t&&(t.style.height=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][e]+\"px\")}}))}();\n\nOver 25% of Black Americans with student loan debt are behind on their payments, and nearly 20% of Hispanic Americans are in a similar situation, according to the Fed. In Maryland and the District of Columbia, nearly a quarter of all student loan borrowers are making no progress toward their student loan payments, according to the Education Department.\n“Student loans are disproportionately held by women, Black and Latinx student loan borrowers  delivering relief to these borrowers would further the interests of racial and gender equity,” Yu said. “Drawing lines to distinguish who deserves relief will inevitably leave out deserving borrowers.”\nThe Senate bill calling for student loan debt forgiveness has been referred to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions. The House bill has been referred to the Committee on Education and Labor and the Committee on Ways and Means."

    "title": "Democrats in Congress search for a compromise on minimum wage",
    "content": "The battle over increasing the minimum wage continues as congressional Democrats attempt to negotiate a compromise that might be less than their initial $15 per hour plan.\nDemocrats in February were forced to remove their proposed $15 minimum wage from a House-passed $1.9 trillion pandemic relief bill after the Senate parliamentarian ruled that it violated budget rules.\nThe relief legislation would have contained a provision penalizing large corporations who did not pay their workers at least $15 per hour. The current minimum wage has been $7.25 per hour since 2009.\nAnother attempt to pass a $15 minimum wage bill, mounted by Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vermont, was rejected by the Senate on March 5 by a vote of  58-42.  Eight Democrats voted against the bill.\nSen. Kyrsten Sinema, D-Arizona, faced criticism for the exaggerated manner in which she cast her vote, delivering a thumbs down in the center of the chamber. The video of her vote went viral.\nIn a March 23 meeting convened by Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-New York, Democrats regrouped to try to find common ground. The meeting included the eight Democrats who opposed the Sanders wage bill.\nSchumer is considering using an arcane budgetary procedure known as reconciliation to renew the effort to pass a $15 wage, The Intercept reported earlier this week.\nPaul Guppy, the vice president of the Washington Policy Center, said that the Democrats are not likely to drop the minimum wage issue.\n“In negotiating terms, the Democrats could always propose a lower number; the federal minimum wage hasnt been changed for many years, so I do think they will propose different numbers,” Guppy said.\nVarious lawmakers have been vocal about their support for increasing minimum wage and have denounced the Senate parliamentarian’s ruling.\nI do believe we should override the parliamentarian,” Rep Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-New York, said. “I think that this is a matter of course and that constituents and people across this country put Democrats in power to, among many other things, establish a $15 minimum wage. We have a responsibility to do that.”\nSen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Maryland, said “Americans should not be robbed of a living wage by archaic Senate rules and procedures—including the filibuster.”\nRepublican lawmakers are not opposed to a minimum wage boost, but differ with the Democrats over how much it should go up and when.\n“It’s true it hasn’t been raised in quite a while, and I think it’s worth discussing,” Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, told reporters on March 2.\nGOP Sens. Mitt Romney of Utah and Tom Cotton of Arkansas have proposed raising the minimum wage to $10 per hour over five years, but that would not start until after the coronavirus pandemic ends.\nMaryland is one of 21 states and 26 cities and counties that raised their minimum wage rates on Jan. 1, according to Raise the Minimum Wage, part of the nonpartisan National Employment Law Project. Maryland’s minimum wage rose from $11 an hour to $11.75 an hour for businesses with 15 or more employees.\nA Hart  Associates poll of 67 competitive House districts found that 62 percent of respondents backed hiking the minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2025. The survey was commissioned by the National Employment Law Project.\nWorkers unions such as the AFL-CIO say that increasing the minimum wage can benefit working Americans. Bill Samuel, the organizations CEO of government affairs, said that “working people have waited long enough.”\n“This overdue raise will bolster the economy, reduce poverty, and ensure working families have the baseline economic security we deserve,” Samuel said. “Whatever it takes, our members expect Congress to get this done.”\nMeanwhile, progressive Democrats are pressing President Joe Biden to renew the push to increase the minimum wage. A group of them met last week with White House Chief of Staff Ron Klain, Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minnesota, said on MSNBC Sunday.\nWe certainly understand that there was a failed strategy, not by the progressives in Congress  because we put (the $15 minimum wage proposal) in the (COVID relief) package  (but) by the administration,” Omar said."

    "title": "Lawmakers renew effort to study slavery reparations",
    "content": "Members of Congress are renewing efforts to reckon with the nation’s racial past, reintroducing legislation that could create a commission to study and possibly offer reparations to descendants of slaves.\nSen. Cory Booker, D-New Jersey, and Rep. Barbara Lee, D-California, sponsored resolutions in both chambers of Congress in February to create a Commission on Truth, Racial Healing, and Transformation.\n“To realize our nation’s promise of being a place for liberty and justice for all, we must acknowledge and address the systemic racism and white supremacy that have been with us since our country’s founding and continue to persist in our laws, our policies and our lives to this day,” Booker said in a statement.\nA reparations commission would study the ways in which systemic racism and persisting racial inequalities have impacted African Americans since the first ship carrying slaves came to what is now the United States in 1619.\n“We’ve made substantial progress, but the legacy of systemic racism clearly shows that the chains of slavery have yet to be broken,” Lee said in a statement. “This commission will educate and inform the public about the historical context for the current inequalities we witness each and every day.”\nCurrent inequalities for Black Americans, according to the resolutions, began with slavery and continued with the government’s failure to “ensure the safety and security of African Americans” with post-Civil War Reconstruction, and in laws passed by state and local governments.\nThe resolution also calls attention to the “other discriminatory actions” against to Black Americans and other marginalized communities like Puerto Ricans and Native Americans. \nEighteen Democratic senators co-sponsored Booker’s measure, including Maryland’s Ben Cardin and Chris Van Hollen, Ed Markey and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, Sherrod Brown of Ohio, Chris Coons of Delaware, Robert Menendez of New Jersey, Jeff Merkley of Oregon, Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island, Tammy Duckworth and Dick Durbin of Illinois, Dianne Feinstein of California, Mazie Hirono of Hawaii, Robert Casey of Pennsylvania, Patty Murray of Washington, Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota. Independent Bernie Sanders of Vermont also is a co-sponsor. \nThere are 129 Democratic co-sponsors on the Lee resolution. \nSeparately, Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas, offered a separate measure in January, similar to proposals in earlier Congresses, to create a reparations commission. That bill has 169 Democratic co-sponsors.\nPresident Joe Biden supports a study of the reparations issue, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki told reporters on Feb. 17.\n“He certainly would support a study of reparations, and.. understands that we don’t need a study to take action, right now, on systemic racism,” she said. “So he wants to take actions within his own government in the meantime.”\nRepublican lawmakers appear to be largely opposed to reparations.\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, said two years ago: “I dont think reparations for something that happened 150 years ago, for whom none of us currently living are responsible, is a good idea.”  \nDr. William Darity, a Duke University professor who specializes in reparations, has openly criticized previous legislative attempts at creating a commission solely for reparations, but supports the latest push for a truth commission instead. \n“The goal of a truth commission in terms of giving us accurate information about America’s racial history, that is valuable in and of itself,” Darity said in an interview with Capital News Service. “I feel a lot more positive about the truth commission idea.”\nIn any reparations proposal that comes about, Darity said, there needs to be three specific directives: an eligibility requirement that all recipients are Black Americans who are descendants of slaves; a focus on closing the racial wealth gap, which at minimum could lead to “$10-12 trillion in government expenditures,” as well as direct payments to eligible recipients. \n“Any bill going forward that is completely open-ended in terms of what the commission can choose to do is really, potentially, quite dangerous,” Darity said. \nIn a Feb. 17 House Judiciary Committee hearing Booker reiterated his support for a a truth, racial healing and transformation commission, saying that the country needs to study slavery’s “harmful and painful legacy.” \n“The stain of slavery was not just inked in bloodshed, but in the overt, state-sponsored policies that fueled white supremacy and racism and have disadvantaged African Americans economically for generations,” Booker said. \nThere are almost 400 nonprofit organizations supporting reparations legislation, according to Kenniss Henry, legislative commission co-chair of the National Coalition of Blacks for Reparation in America, or NCOBRA. \nThe recent support, Henry noted, is partly due to an increased public awareness of social justice issues following the death of George Floyd in May 2020.\n“At no other time have we been able to generate such support,” Henry said. “The biggest obstacles that are in the way are in Congress, with the inability for there to be bipartisan support for key legislation that provides greater opportunities for marginalized people.”"

    "title": "Bill to expand protections for LGBTQ Americans faces hurdles in the Senate",
    "content": "The Senate is considering House-passed legislation that would broaden federal protections for LGBTQ Americans against discrimination in housing, employment and public services ranging from retail stores to doctors’ offices.\nAdvocates for the Equality Act are hoping chances for final passage have improved since the Democrats last November won narrow control of the Senate.\n“In 29 states today, LGBTQ Americans can be married in the morning, rejected from a restaurant at lunch, denied a mortgage, dismissed from jury duty in the afternoon, and evicted from their home that same night,” Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Oregon, a proponent of the bill, said at a March 17 Senate Judiciary Committee hearing. “How can we say that any of these Americans are treated equally in dignity and promise to all others?”\nThe Equality Act would amend the Civil Rights Act of 1964, not only providing protections against discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or sexual identity in housing, work and public accommodations, but also in education, federally-funded programs, credit and jury service.\nLGBTQ Americans can currently lose their jobs in 21 states just for being LGBTQ, according to Christian Unkenholz, press secretary for Rep. Anthony Brown, D-Largo, They can be denied housing in 27 states, denied public accommodations in 25 states, denied education in 31 states, and denied the right to serve on a jury in 41 states.\nThe bill has twice passed the House – once in 2019, and again this year on Feb. 25, on a vote of 224-206. Just three House Republicans joined Democrats in approving the measure.\nPresident Joe Biden has promised to sign the bill into law if it reaches his desk.\n“Every person should be treated with dignity and respect, and this bill represents a critical step toward ensuring that America lives up to our foundational values of equality and freedom for all,” he said in a Feb. 19 statement. “Full equality has been denied to LGBTQ+ Americans and their families for far too long. Despite the extraordinary progress the LGBTQ+ community has made to secure their basic civil rights, discrimination is still rampant in many areas of our society.”\nHowever, the Equality Act remains a deeply partisan issue. Many Republicans in Congress say they fear what the bill would do to women’s rights under Title IX.\n“Although this act supports the prevention of discrimination, it actually causes it by undermining hard-fought protections for women,” Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith, R-Mississippi, told the hearing.\nThe Equality Act would ensure that transgender women and girls are allowed to share private spaces such as bathrooms, dressing rooms, and locker rooms with cisgender women, which many opponents are concerned about.\nThe proposed law’s impact on women in sports also has fueled opposition. Chelsea Mitchell, a high school star athlete in Connecticut, told senators she thought it was unfair that she had to compete with transgender women who had a physical advantage over her.\n“Losing a state championship is hard, but losing one because the race isn’t fair is gut-wrenching,” Mitchell said.\nSen. James Lankford, R-Oklahoma, said he worried about a lack of religious exemptions. The Equality Act would categorize churches as “public accommodations as an establishment.”\nDeeming houses of worship as public accommodations subjects them to needless litigation, and the Equality Act would literally strip them of the very defense they were given in 1993, Lankford said. \nBut proponents of the bill emphasized at the hearing how crucial the Equality Act is for LGBTQ Americans.\n“Our nation is at its best when it seeks to expand opportunity and embrace the beautiful diversity of the American people,” Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wisconsin, the first openly LGBTQ senator, said during the March 17 hearing.\nBaldwin said that the Equality Act is not about diminishing the rights of others, but making the nation’s decades-old framework inclusive of LGBTQ people and affording them more opportunities.\nStella Keating, a high school student from Tacoma, Washington, said in her testimony that she is worried as a transgender woman about how less than half of the states in the United States provide equal protection for her under the law.\n“What happens if I want to attend college in a state that doesn’t protect me?” Keating asked. “Right now, I could be denied medical care or be evicted for simply being transgender in many states. How is that even right? How is that even American?”\nProponents of the Equality Act point to broad public support for the measure.\nA poll released Tuesday by the nonpartisan Public Religion Research Institute found that more than three in four (76 percent) Americans favor laws that would protect lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender Americans from discrimination in jobs, housing and public accommodation. Less than one in five (19 percent) oppose such protections.\nThe Equality Act also is supported by over 600 organizations across the political spectrum, the chief sponsor, Rep. David Cicilline, D-Rhode Island, said. The organizations include the AFL-CIO, the NAACP, the National PTA, and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Hundreds of American companies, such as Kellogg’s and Hershey’s, also support his bill, Cicilline said."

    "title": "Judges and experts say judiciary needs greater racial and gender diversity",
    "content": "Judges from all levels of the U.S. court system and legal experts told a congressional panel Thursday that the federal judiciary needed greater racial and gender diversity.\n“I feel there is a cost when voices are missing from the room,” U.S. District Judge Edward Chen told the House Judiciary subcommittee on courts, intellectual property and the internet. “That cost isn’t theoretical, it is real. Diversity makes for a better judiciary, that in turn helps fulfill our promise for justice for all.”\nJudges shared anecdotes from their own experiences dealing with diversity in the courts, cited cases where the diversity of judges impacted the outcome of cases and discussed the overwhelming whiteness of judges in the judicial branch.\nWhile some argued that increasing diversity would increase trust in the judicial system and make the system overall more fair and representative of the general American population, some lawmakers saw the calls for more diversity as an invitation to more racial discrimination and furthering political ideologies.\n“Today this committee’s message is: ‘We will judge you by the color of your skin, race, gender and politics, not by your character or qualifications,’” said Rep. Tom Tiffany, R-Wisconsin. “Over the last few years we’ve seen well-qualified and diverse nominations to the courts. However, because they were Republican nominations, the Democrats didn’t think they were diverse enough.”\nBut the judges and experts told the panel that the goal was not to over-diversify, but to remove barriers to allow qualified judges of color and female judges to rise through the ranks.\n“No one on these panels (is) arguing that people ought to be appointed to positions or have an opportunity to achieve just because of their gender or their appearance,” said Circuit Judge Bernice Donald. “They should be able to compete without the barrier of race or gender or socioeconomic status.”\nRep. Ted Lieu, D-California, passionately argued against what he called the “lie” that minorities are less qualified to be in high-ranking judge positions, which accounts for the lack of diversity.\n“When you have a federal judiciary that is 73 percent white and male, far above that actual population of white males, and then you say that the reason is because of merit, you’re sending the message that minorities are less qualified, more stupid, less good to be judges on the federal judiciary,” Lieu said. “That is what is so corrosive about not diversifying the federal judiciary.”\nOther committee members questioned the validity of the argument that the lack of diversity among judges is a product of capability.\n“You just can’t tell me that the only qualified people in America to be judges are white people who went to Harvard or Yale,” Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-California, said.\nA more diverse bench would call on different life experiences, different educations, and different legal experiences to create an overall more equitable, trusted judicial system, judges and experts told the subcommittee."

    "title": "Van Hollen, other lawmakers want to block permanent U.S. Capitol fencing",
    "content": "The United States Capitol has been surrounded by fencing since just after the deadly Jan. 6 assault on the building, but Maryland Sen. Chris Van Hollen and other lawmakers want to make sure the barriers do not become permanent.\n“We can achieve security here without building a wall,” Van Hollen, a Democrat, said at a press conference just outside the Capitol.\nHe and Republican Sen. Roy Blunt of Missouri, along with Democratic Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton of the District of Columbia, have introduced bills that would prohibit the construction of permanent fencing around the United States Capitol complex.\nThe outer perimeter fence that had surrounded the entire Capitol Complex was completely removed on Wednesday. A separate fence remains around the Capitol, but without the razor wire that topped it when it was first installed.\nAccording to Blunt, he and Van Hollen drew up their bill in response to a similar bill sponsored by Norton in the House.\nBlunt said permanent fencing would be bad for the general public, the city and international optics.\n“People from all over our country and all over the world visit here,” Blunt said. “They’ve been able to visit here with a sense of openness and welcomeness that we want them to continue to have.”\nThe fences have created problems for the city, the lawmakers said. Traffic has been interrupted and redirected and the local neighborhood was cut off from the sprawling green spaces inside the fences.\nThe D.C. Council sent a letter on Feb. 23 to Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-New York, and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-California, requesting that they prevent any of the security fencing from becoming permanent due to the difficulties that the barriers imposed upon the city.\n“Now that we have bipartisan, bicameral support,” Norton said, “it’s time to get rid of fences of the kind that were invented 10,000 years ago.”\nNorton also emphasized that other technology besides fences can meet the security needs of the Capitol.\nBlunt, Van Hollen and Norton also said security could be improved without fences with better police training, more funding and personnel for the U.S. Capitol Police and improved protocols for calling in the National Guard in emergencies. \nBlunt and Van Hollen agreed that the Jan. 6 attack was a failure of intelligence, not a failure of infrastructure.\n“I have thought for sometime that the police board itself doesn’t function well in easy circumstances and really isn’t designed to function at all in a crisis,” said Blunt.\nBlunt urged the secretaries of defense and the Army to testify to Congress to explain why there was a 30-minute gap during the Capitol attack between when a decision was made to deploy troops and when they decided to inform anyone.\nBlunt said lawmakers are not against putting up fences when it is necessary. The bill does not bar the use of short-term fencing for events.\n“None of us are saying we dont want a fence anywhere any time and when you anticipate you need it, you can put it up,” Blunt said.\nThe senators said they were confident the ban on permanent fencing will pass both houses of Congress. Van Hollen said he knew of no opposition.\n“I don’t see any opposition on our side,” Norton added."

    "title": "House clears two gun safety bills, but Senate may be roadblock",
    "content": "The House sent two bills to the Senate Thursday that would implement universal background checks and close the loophole linked to the 2015 mass shooting in Charleston, South Carolina. \nGun violence is devastating our communities. Every day, 30 people are killed by someone using a gun, a number that jumps to 100 if you factor in accidents and suicides involving guns, Rep. Mike Thompson, D-California, the sponsor of the Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2021. said in a statement. \nThompsons bill was passed 227-203, with one Democrat voting against it and eight Republicans voting for it.The legislation would expand background checks on all firearm sales, closing the so-called gun show loophole and regulating online private sales.\nBackground checks work, and expanding them would only make more people safe from gun violence, Thompson said.\nA second measure, the Enhanced Background Checks Act of 2021, passed 219-210, with two Republicans voting for and two Democrats voting against it. \nThis bill would nullify the Charleston loophole in federal law that allows for the sale of firearms to proceed even if a background check has not been completed after three business days. Instead, the new proposal would increase the waiting period from three days to 10.\nHouse Majority Whip Jim Clyburn, D-South Carolina, the author of the bill, said this gap in the law allowed a white supremacist to carry out the 2015 mass-shooting of nine people at Mother Emanuel AME Church in Charleston.\nThese people who were practicing their faith, their faith that taught them to welcome in a stranger, a stranger came to their door and they welcomed into their Bible study, he sat with them for an hour, Clyburn said on the House floor. The stranger that they had welcomed in had opened fire and killed nine of them, one of whom was the pastor, a former intern of mine.\nClyburn said his bill, if it had been the law at the time, would have prevented the shooter from getting a gun.\nJason Ouimet, executive director of the National Rifle Association’s Institute for Legislative Action, said the bills are transparent attempts to restrict Americans rights under the guise of addressing the countrys violent crime culture in a statement released after the vote.\nBy giving full power to unelected government bureaucrats to indefinitely delay and prevent lawful firearm transfers, (the Clyburn bill) could ultimately destroy the Second Amendment rights guaranteed to every law-abiding American by turning it into a privilege enjoyed by a select few, Ouimet said.\nHe also said that the universal background checks in Thompson’s legislation could not be enforced without a federal gun registry. \nBoth bills are headed to a contentious Senate where passage will be an uphill battle. Ten Republicans  as well as all 50 Democrats  would need to support the proposals to pass them. \nLegislation addressing the “Charleston loophole” left the House in 2019 but was stalled after then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, did not bring it up for a vote. \nIn a press conference Thursday, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-New York, said the Senate would vote on the matter.\nLast time it went to Mitch McConnells legislative graveyard,” Schumer said. “The legislative graveyard is over. We will see where everybody stands. No more thoughts and prayers. A vote is what we need.\nRepublicans argue that the bills are unconstitutional and inadequate. \nRep. Dan Meuser, R-Pennsylvania, voted against both bills, saying they would threaten the Second Amendment and do nothing to keep Americans safer.\nThese bills are being sold to the public as an effort to pass universal background checks, but House Democrats fail to recognize that every commercial gun sale in the United States already has a background check, Meuser said after the vote. Once again, Democrat leadership is proposing legislation that would do nothing to prevent criminals from accessing firearms, while greatly restricting the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding citizens.\nRepublicans warn that Americans would suffer from the ridiculous criminal penalties that the Democrats’ legislation would put in place. \nFor instance, if you loaned a friend a rifle to go hunting, they could face a year in prison and a $100,000 fine, Meuser said. The same would be true if you loan an abuse victim a firearm for self-defense. (Clyburn’s proposal) would create arbitrary delays for firearms purchases and could allow the FBI to delay a firearm transfer indefinitely.\nRep. Kelly Armstrong, R-North Dakota, said the two bills punish private citizens and add layers of red tape and delay for those who need immediate access to firearms for protection.\nNo date has been set yet for discussions to begin in the Senate. Once the bills arrive, Democrats will either have to secure a new wave of bipartisan support or likely deal with a Republican filibuster that would take 60 votes to stop.\nNicole Hockley, whose son Dylan was among the 20 children and six adults killed in a mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, in 2012, said in a statement “we need to put all we’ve got” into passing the background checks measures.\n“This is our best chance in eight years to finally make this commonsense reform a reality,” said Hockley, who is with Sandy Hook Promise Action Fund."

    "title": "Senate gets landmark voting legislation, but partisanship poses steep challenges",
    "content": "A House-passed package overhauling voting, improving election security and reforming campaign finance laws is now in the Senate, where deep partisan divisions spell an uncertain fate for the landmark bill.\nH.R. 1, also known as the For the People Act of 2021, is sponsored by Rep. John Sarbanes, D-Towson, and co-sponsored by every House Democrat. The measure passed the House March 3 on a 220-210 party-line vote.\nSarbanes wrote in a letter on his website that H.R. 1 was “a once-in-a-generation reform effort to protect and expand the right to vote, clean up corruption in Washington and restore trust, transparency and integrity in government.”\n“Marylanders and Americans of all political stripes are demanding real change and accountability from their elected officials,” the congressman said. “People are deeply frustrated by the state of our political system – where voter suppression, extreme partisan gerrymandering and big, dark, special-interest money drown out the voices of ordinary Americans.”\nSarbanes’s bill focuses on three major areas: setting federal standards to make it easier to register to vote and to cast a ballot, expanding public financing of congressional campaigns and requiring greater transparency on donors, and increasing accountability for public officials.\nThe voting section of the act aims to institute automatic voter registration, put an end to partisan gerrymandering and enhance federal support for voting system security.\nIn terms of campaign financing, the Sarbanes bill would require all organizations involved in political activity to disclose large donors. It also would create a “multiple matching system for small donations,” paid for by a surcharge on government settlements with corporations and individuals found to have violated federal laws.\nIn its third section, the bill establishes tighter ethical standards for conflicts of interest in the executive branch, requires development of a code of ethics for justices on the Supreme Court, toughens foreign agents’ registrations and expands requirements for registering as a lobbyist.\nRep. Andrew Harris, R-Cockeysville, was among a host of Republican critics of the elections measure.\n“This bill is a partisan attempt to overhaul elections, and a complete sellout to the swamp, as it will aid embedded politicians by using hard-earned taxpayer dollars to fuel political campaigns,” Harris said in a statement.\nStill, over 150 grassroots organizations have endorsed the Sarbanes proposal.\nThe Declaration for American Democracy is a coalition representing a range of labor, racial justice, faith, women’s rights, and environmental organizations.\n“For far too long, special interests, wealthy donors, and vote suppressors have dominated our politics and attempted to silence the voices of everyday Americans, especially in Black and Brown communities,” the group said in a memo. “The For the People Act would help shift power away from bad actors and transfer it to ‘we the people.’”\nIn pre-taped remarks on Sunday, President Joe Biden said the legislation “is urgently needed to protect the right to vote, the integrity of our elections, and to repair and strengthen our democracy.”\nHe added that he hopes the Senate “does its work” so he can sign the legislation into law.\nThat may be a tall order for supporters of the bill, which would require 60 votes for passage. Even if all 50 Senate Democrats embrace the measure, GOP opposition appears nearly unanimous at this point.\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, on Tuesday denounced the bill as an “effort to rewrite the ground rules of American elections and seize power from states and localities.”\n“It’s quite the recipe for rebuilding public faith in our democracy on all sides — a purely partisan effort to seize unprecedented power for Washington D.C. on a razor-thin majority,” McConnell said on the Senate floor, “a hugely harmful idea at the worst possible time.”\nH.R. 1 has yet to be scheduled on the Senate’s legislative calendar. But Democrats are divided over whether to attempt to abolish the filibuster, the 60-vote threshold for cutting off debate to pass major legislation. The filibuster may figure in the future of many House-passed bills facing Senate action  and Republican opposition.\n“Were going to figure out a way,” Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-New York, said in a recent interview with Politico.\n“It’s a passion of mine to get (election reform) done, when you see what theyre doing in the states to change voting rights,” Schumer said. “Everythings on the table. We have to. What is not an option is not getting bold things done.”"

    "title": "Democrats want total ban on members carrying guns in the U.S. Capitol",
    "content": "In the wake of the Jan. 6 assault on the United States Capitol and some members of Congress carrying firearms near the House floor, Democratic lawmakers are proposing a ban on guns in Congress. \n“I’ve been pushing for years to change this outdated rule, knowing there was an inevitable risk in allowing members to carry guns in the Capitol,” Rep. Jared Huffman, D-California, the primary sponsor of the ban, said in a statement. “While we’d like to think we could rely on common decency, we now have colleagues who are QAnon and white supremacist sympathizers, incite violence and insurrection, and have even bragged about bringing guns into the House chamber.”\nHuffman so far has collected 39 Democratic cosponsors for his measure.\nThe lawmaker introduced the bill in late January after Rep. Andy Harris, R-Cockeysville, was stopped short of the House floor for carrying a gun. Other Republicans previously had ignored metal detectors placed at the entrance to the House floor after the Capitol assault, prompting House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-California, to impose fines on anyone refusing to abide by the security procedures.\nFirearms, dangerous weapons, explosives, or incendiary devices already are expressly forbidden near or on the House floor. \nHuffman’s legislation addresses a loophole in current Capitol Police Board regulations that allows members of Congress and their staffs to carry weapons on the Capitol grounds. If enacted, the bill not only would ban weapons but also would require members to follow the gun safety and registration requirements established by the District of Columbia. \n“These outdated and dangerous rules must be modernized. Members of Congress should not be above the law,” Huffman said. \nRep. Jackie Speier, D-California, echoed the concern. \n“The existing exemption for representatives increases the risk of gun violence for members, staff, and the public,” she said in the statement. “It’s long past time we close the member loophole and protect all who enter the Capitol complex.”\nHarris alerted a magnetometer Jan. 21 outside of the House chamber and was found to be carrying a concealed firearm. The incident resulted in Harris receiving a security pat-down and the Capitol Police launching an investigation. \nCapitol Police did not respond to Capital News Service about whether the investigation into Harris is still open.\nHarris’s chief of staff, Bryan Shuy, issued a statement following the incident, saying it was a matter of public record that Harris has a Maryland handgun permit, always follows House rules regarding metal detectors and wanding and has never brought a firearm onto the House floor. \n“Because his and his family’s lives have been threatened by someone who has been released awaiting trial, for security reasons, the congressman never confirms whether he nor anyone else he’s with are carrying a firearm for self-defense,” Shuy said.\nRep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-New York, told CNN’s Chris Cuomo that Harris’s “attempt” of Harris to bring a gun onto the House floor was disturbing.\n“I don’t care if you accidentally set it off. I don’t care if you intentionally set it off. I don’t care if you don’t set it off at all,” Ocasio-Cortez said. “You are endangering the lives of members of Congress, and it is absolutely outrageous that we even have to have this conversation.” \nOcasio-Cortez is not a cosponsor of Huffman’s No Congressional Loophole Act. \nThe bill’s supporters argue that members of Congress should be held to the same laws as all those who walk through the Capitol grounds. Huffman said that given the rise of political violence, members and staffs not complying with gun safety standards leads to an unsafe workplace. \n“As a survivor of gun violence, I know what it’s like to battle for your life after being shot five times and left for dead,” Speier said. “And statistics show that accidents happen when there are firearms around.” \nSpeier was a congressional aide when she was severely wounded during a 1978 ambush by People’s Temple followers in Jonestown, Guyana, an attack that left five people dead, including her boss, Rep. Leo Ryan, D-California.\nOpponents of the bill claim that such an act would infringe on lawmakers’ right to self-defense in a time of ever-growing threats and political violence.\nA group of 83 House Republicans signed a letter to House leadership urging both parties’ leaders not to change the rules governing the carrying of firearms. The letter cited a history of violent attacks on members of Congress and Capitol Police. \n“Protecting the safety and lives of members of Congress is of the utmost concern and isn’t a partisan issue,” the letter said. “We ask that you stand with members of Congress on both sides of the aisle that support the lawful and current Capitol Police Board regulations that have existed for more than half a century.”\nA proposal similar to Huffman’s was not included in the rules package governing the 117th United States Congress. \nHuffman’s proposal was referred to the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee for consideration.\n“For everyone’s safety, members of Congress must be subject to the same gun restrictions that apply to everyone else who visits or works in the Capitol,” Huffman said."

    "title": "Biden administration attempts to revive Iran nuclear talks, but tensions persist",
    "content": "The Biden administration’s attempts to revive talks with Iran over curbing its nuclear program are complicated by continuing tensions over human rights abuses, the unsolved fate of the longest-held American hostage, Iranian proxy attacks on U.S. troops in Iraq, and bipartisan pressure from Congress to expand the parameters of any new deal. \nThe State Department announced on Feb. 18 the United States would accept an invitation from the European Union High Representative to attend a meeting of the five United Nations Security Council members and Iran to discuss the future of the Iranian nuclear program. \nThe Biden administration has since rescinded former President Donald Trump’s determination that all U.S. sanctions against Iran must be restored; also rescinded were heavy travel restrictions on Iranian diplomats posted to the United Nations. \nDespite these steps, the administration has made it clear the United States would only return to the 2015 nuclear agreement if Iran would comply with the original terms. Secretary of State Antony Blinken reassured lawmakers Wednesday at a House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing that those requirements have not changed.\nIran announced on Feb. 23 that it had halted voluntary implementation of additional protocols agreed to under the deal, a sign interpreted by the international community that Tehran intended to ramp up its nuclear program. \nIran also initially indicated it was not willing to attend EU-brokered talks with Washington regarding the deal. Iran’s leaders cited as a prime reason for the continuing heavy sanctions imposed by Washington. \n“Considering the recent actions and statements by the United States and three European powers, Iran does not consider this the time to hold an informal meeting with these countries, which was proposed by the EU foreign policy chief,” Iran Foreign Ministry spokesman Saeed Khatibzadeh said Feb. 28. \nIran has since softened, announcing last Friday that it would be ready to resume talks if the United States and other western powers provide a “clear signal” that sanctions, dating back to the Carter administration, will be lifted within a year. \nIn a meeting with Irish Defense Minister Simon Coveney, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said, “Iran is ready to immediately take compensatory measures based on the nuclear deal and fulfill its commitments just after the U.S. illegal sanctions are lifted and it abandons its policy of threats and pressure.”\nIn an interview with the Financial Times, former Revolutionary Guards commander and potential conservative presidential candidate Mohsen Rezaei said sanctions would have to be lifted monthly, with top priority given to financial transactions and oil exports. \nEven so, the fraught U.S.-Iran relationship has multiple unresolved issues.\nOn Tuesday, the State Department urged the Iranian government to address the disappearance 14 years ago of former FBI agent Robert Levinson. U.S. officials believe he was taken hostage off Iran’s coast, but Tehran has denied it knows anything about him. Levinson’s family has said it is likely he died in Iranian custody.\n“We call on the Iranian government to provide credible answers to what happened to Bob Levinson and to immediately and safely release all U.S. citizens who are unjustly held captive in Iran,” Blinken said in a statement. “The abhorrent act of unjust detentions for political gain must cease immediately.”\nAlso on Tuesday, the State Department designated two interrogators with the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps “for their involvement in gross violations of human rights, namely the torture and/or cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment of political prisoners and persons detained during protests in 2019 and 2020 in Iran,” Blinken said.\nUnder the designation, the two will be barred from entry to the United States.\n“We will continue to consider all appropriate tools to impose costs on those responsible for human rights violations and abuses in Iran,” Blinken said. “We will also work with our allies to promote accountability for such violations and abuses.”\nIran and the United States also are colliding in the Mideast, where Iran-backed militia in Syria last month attacked American troops in Iraq. President Joe Biden subsequently ordered retaliatory airstrikes.\nSuch clashes underscore concerns among Democrats and Republicans in Congress that renewing the nuclear deal must encompass broader issues such as Iran’s efforts to expand its influence in the region and its sponsorship of terrorism.\nIn a letter Tuesday organized by Reps. Anthony Brown, D-Largo, and Michael Waltz, R-Florida, a bipartisan group of 140 House members told Blinken that the United States and its allies “must engage Iran through a combination of diplomatic and sanction mechanisms to achieve full compliance of international obligations and a demonstrated commitment by Iran to addressing its malign behavior.”\n“Three core tenets  their nuclear program, their ballistic missile program, and their funding of terrorism  must be addressed from the outset,” the lawmakers wrote. \nThe nuclear deal, formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), has been in limbo following the U.S. withdrawal in 2018 by Trump. \nNegotiated during the Obama administration and in partnership with the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council, the agreement was created to limit Iran’s nuclear program and uranium enrichment. \nIn response to Washington’s withdrawal, Iran began ramping up nuclear activity, enriching uranium up to 20%, above the 3.67% limit set in the 2015 deal, but under the 90% level of weapons-grade uranium.\nUnder the terms of the nuclear deal, Iran is only allowed to enrich uranium with a certain type of less sophisticated centrifuges. Since the United State’s withdrawal from the agreement, Iran has installed advanced centrifuges. \nA report issued Monday by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) found that Iran began enriching uranium with a third centrifuge cascade, directly violating the clause regarding centrifuge technology. \nTensions between Washington and Tehran have been mounting since the withdrawal, escalating in 2020 with the death of the commander of Iranian forces, Qassim Suleimani, in an airstrike in Iraq. \nIran will prove as intransigent under the Biden administration as it was during the Trump years, according to Ellie Geranmayeh, senior policy fellow and deputy director of the Middle East and North Africa program at the European Council on Foreign Relations. She spoke at a Brookings Institution panel on Iran last month. \nGeranmayeh believes that despite Iran’s economic state, the government believes it can manage and even prolong an impasse for another four years if need be, while also expanding nuclear activities to the levels negotiated in the initial 2015 agreement. \nShe added the Iranian government’s position on the country’s economic status can be backed up from data coming from the International Monetary Fund and World Bank that “suggest that Iran, even with Trump-era sanctions in place, even with the COVID pandemic, is likely to see a marginal upward growth.” \nShe said that, based on the data suggesting that sanctions are not hurting Iran that much economically, she doesn’t “see any appetite in Tehran right now to negotiate the JCPOA minus or JCPOA plus.” \nHowever, she said that Iran has left the door open to diplomacy “without moving the goalposts,” making it possible for its return to the negotiating table. \nBut Alex Vatanka, the director of the Iran Program at the Middle East Institute, believes Tehran has no choice but to come back to the table given its current economic troubles. \n“They dont have much choice about what they like and what they dont like,” Vatanka told Capital News Service. “The question is, how much more sanctions can they endure? They are economically not in a good place.” \nHe said Tehran’s hope is to reach a settlement, whether directly or through mediations by the Europeans. But in order to get there, Tehran has to go back and restrict its nuclear activities to convince Washington to lift the sanctions. \nVatanka said if the talks preliminary to negotiating are successful, then “you can envision a situation where Iran and the U.S. can talk about other issues of concern, including Iran’s regional agenda, its ballistic missile arsenal, and more.” \nWhen it comes to the issue of sanctions, which date back to President Jimmy Carter and the dissolution of the Iranian monarchy, Vatanka said the easier solution for the U.S. will be to “lift principle sanctions on (Tehran), including Irans ability to sell oil related to be able to access international banking system that those two things are the most important part of the sanctions that they like.”"

    "title": "Consumer groups ask for more targeted poultry inspections to curb contamination",
    "content": "Four consumer advocacy groups are urging the Agriculture Department to improve its regulations and enforcement procedures to prevent the continued contamination of poultry with salmonella and campylobacter, two of the most common causes of food-borne illness in the United States.\nCurrently, the USDA’s Food Safety and Inspection Service regulates the amounts of salmonella and campylobacter found in mostly randomly-selected poultry at production and distribution plants, warning companies with too-high rates of contamination and placing those companies’ names on a publicly accessible list.\nBut the consumer groups say current inspection practices are not effective and, as a result, aren’t making a dent in the number of people who are getting sick from contaminated poultry.\nThe Center for Science in the Public Interest, Consumer Reports, the Consumer Federation of America and STOP Foodborne Illness are proposing tighter, more targeted federal poultry regulation and inspection procedures.\n“Outbreak data suggests that consumption of poultry meat represents the leading source of both salmonella and campylobacter illnesses,” the groups say in their petition. “Nevertheless, contamination remains high in many products. Measures taken to date to control contamination in poultry products have yet to have a significant impact on human illness rates.”\nPoultry inspections should focus on the most dangerous types of salmonella and campylobacter with the aim of eliminating them at production plants, the consumer organizations said. Violators should face more severe sanctions than simply having their names published on a public list, they said.\nPoultry companies also should be held at least partially responsible for using any contaminated poultry, much like the Food and Drug Administration holds food companies partially responsible for their contaminated ingredients, according to the groups’ petition.\nIn addition, the groups want the USDA to have standard procedures for keeping live birds, as well as their housing, bedding, feed and water clear of contamination, including during transportation and slaughter.\nThis is a medical illustration of drug-resistant salmonella enterica typhi, one of the more common types of salmonella to cause human illness. (James Archer/Antibiotic Resistance Coordination and Strategy Unit, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Public Health Image Library)\nMany of these measures are already common at American poultry farms, according to veterinarian and CSPI Food Safety Campaign Manager James Kincheloe. He added that most of the other changes could be accomplished with microbial testing of birds before and after they are slaughtered.\nRather than instituting grandiose, expensive changes, Kincheloe explained, the changes mentioned in the petition would mean an increase in tests that are already normal parts of the poultry production process.\nBoth salmonella and campylobacter are families of bacteria that can cause human illness. They are often transmitted in food products, particularly poultry.\nHumans most commonly get salmonella from contaminated food, contaminated water and interacting with live animals, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nSymptoms of salmonella poisoning generally begin between six hours and six days of infection, and may last between four and seven days. Symptoms may include bloody diarrhea, stomach cramps, fever, nausea, vomiting and headaches. In extreme cases, salmonella can spread to the bloodstream, with sometimes fatal results.\nCampylobacter, like salmonella, is often spread to humans through foods of all types, unclean water and live animals. Victims experience illness similar to that caused by salmonella. But campylobacter infections also may result in some daunting complications, including irritable bowel syndrome, temporary paralysis and arthritis.\nCampylobacter infection also has the dubious honor of being the most commonly identified cause of Guillan-Barré syndrome, an autoimmune disorder that attacks the nervous system, causing muscle weakness, paralysis and sometimes death. Recovery can range from a few weeks to a few years.\nWhile nearly every food  produce, dairy, meat  has the potential to spread salmonella and campylobacter infections, poultry remains at the top of the CDC’s list of common causes for outbreaks.\nAs consumer advocacy groups have continued to track these outbreaks in recent years, a pattern has emerged: only a very small group of the thousands of salmonella types are actually causing illnesses and deaths, according to Kincheloe.\n“To us at CSPI and STOP and our other co-signatories, it makes sense to start to target those specific types of salmonella,” Kincheloe said. “The science is there. And thats really the No. 1 driver of when we put in a petition like this… We have evidence to show that there are things we can do to target these specific types. So we feel that its time to take those actions.”\nBut the National Chicken Council, which represents chicken producers, processors, distributors and “allied industry firms” in the United States, opposes additional regulation.\n“Chicken production is already one of the most heavily regulated industries in the United States,” said Dr. Ashley Peterson, the council’s senior vice president of scientific and regulatory affairs.\n“Companies have invested tens of millions of dollars in technology and other scientifically-validated measures to enhance the safety profile of chicken products,” she said. “A science-based, multi-tiered approach aimed at reducing all pathogen strains on raw meat and poultry products results in a more appropriate and effective use of agency resources compared to a separate focus on specific, individual strains.”\nBut such well-established procedures are flawed, according to Michael Taylor, co-chair of STOP Foodborne Illness and former acting undersecretary for food safety at the USDA’s Food Safety and Inspection Service.\nSalmonella and campylobacter continued to account for “over 70% of the illnesses transmitted commonly by food… sickening an estimated 1.9 million Americans each year,” Taylor wrote in a recent op-ed in Food Safety News.\nIn 2018, nearly 300 people fell ill due to food-borne campylobacter contamination in the United States, according to the CDC. Close to 4,800 people were similarly infected with food-borne salmonella, and more than 1,100 of those people were Maryland residents, two of whom died.\n!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var e in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var t=document.getElementById(\"datawrapper-chart-\"+e)||document.querySelector(\"iframe[src*='\"+e+\"']\");t&&(t.style.height=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][e]+\"px\")}}))}();\n\n!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var e in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var t=document.getElementById(\"datawrapper-chart-\"+e)||document.querySelector(\"iframe[src*='\"+e+\"']\");t&&(t.style.height=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][e]+\"px\")}}))}();\n\nThese numbers were higher than they’ve been since 1997, according to the CDC. And rates were visibly unimproved by the introduction of new performance standards for corporations in 2016, which placed a salmonella and campylobacter contamination limit on all raw poultry parts. Before 2016, the USDA only officially set salmonella and campylobacter limits for ground poultry meat.\nMany consumer advocacy groups believe that this lack of improvement proves that the current regulations and procedures used by poultry companies and the USDA are not doing what they were intended to do.\nIn the 1990s, the safety of poultry and meat products still primarily relied on visual confirmation of sanitary standards; it was the beginning of any lab-style testing of poultry and meat products, although this type of inspection was done mostly at random.\nToday, the presence of campylobacter can be detected in poultry before slaughter with microbial testing, much like how people are tested for infection. This testing is often done at random, occasionally in response to a visually problematic piece of meat.\nThis is a computer-generated image of a cluster of drug-resistant campylobacter, one of the most common causes of human food-borne illnesses. (Alissa Eckert/Antibiotic Resistance Coordination and Strategy Unit, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Public Health Image Library)\nIn addition, the source of salmonella contamination in poultry can be traced to either pre-slaughter contamination or post-slaughter contamination of the meat.\nThis is because salmonella does not originate in poultry meat. It must be introduced from the outside: spread through live flocks, slaughterhouse contamination or from poultry intestines. Once contamination has been identified, there are only a handful of paths for an investigator to trace to find its origins.\n“No one wants to reduce salmonella and campylobacter more than the companies producing our food,” Peterson said.\nBut she cautioned: “Raw chicken, just like any other raw agricultural commodity, is not a sterile product, and no regulation or law will ever make it sterile.”\n“There is still the possibility of illness if a raw product is improperly handled or cooked,” Peterson said. “Proper handling and cooking of poultry is the one thing that will eliminate any risk of food-borne illness.”\nPlacing the onus of properly “cooking away” bacterial contaminants upon the consumer is not unusual. In a 1974 federal court decision, U.S. Circuit Judge Roger Robb wrote that “American housewives and cooks normally are not ignorant or stupid and their methods of preparing and cooking of food do not ordinarily result in salmonellosis.”\nBut that principle  besides the dated and sexist reference  leaves out consumers who believe that they are purchasing their food ready-made, such as from a restaurant, a very common vector for food-borne illness according to the CDC.\nIn one such instance, which took place throughout the end of 1992 and the beginning of 1993, over 500 people became ill due to E. coli-contaminated hamburger meat. All of the cases were traced to a restaurant chain in the state of Washington. This incident, sometimes called “the Jack in the Box outbreak” for the eponymous restaurant chain, was one of the incidents that led to the formation of STOP Foodborne Illness.\nThe consumer advocacy groups’ petition can be found in full under the “Petitions” section of the Food Safety and Inspection Service’s website, fsis.usda.gov.\nUSDA Food Safety and Inspection Service spokesman Buck McKay said his agency expects “a significant number of comments.”\nThe opportunity for public comments on the petition closes April 6."

    "title": "Biden and congressional Democrats try 180-degree turn on immigration",
    "content": "Using executive orders and new legislative proposals, the Biden administration is attempting a sweeping overhaul of the nation’s immigration system  changes that are aimed at reversing the policies of the Donald Trump years. \n“We are dedicated to achieving and, quite frankly, are working around the clock to replace the cruelty of the past administration with an orderly, humane, and safe immigration process,” Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas told reporters at a White House press conference Monday. “It is hard, and it will take time.” \nPresident Joe Biden issued a series of executive orders early last month that required a review of Trump’s actions that created barriers to legal immigration and hindered asylum-seekers, and he set up a task force to reunite families separated at the United States-Mexico border. \nOn Jan. 20, his first day in office, Biden also sent Congress a legislative package, called the U.S. Citizenship Act of 2021, which would create an eight-year path to citizenship instead of the original 13 for those living in the United States illegally. \nThe proposed legislation includes an exemption for undocumented immigrants who came to the country as children who fall under Temporary Protected Status, so-called “dreamers.” Individuals who came to the United States before Jan. 1 would qualify for green cards, thus granting them legal status. \nThe measure also would seek to clear EB-5 visa backlogs, remove the word “alien” and replace it with “noncitizen” in immigration laws, and invest $4 billion over four years in the U.S.-Mexico border area and Central American nations of El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras.\nDemocratic congressional leaders have embraced the Biden plan, but differences in their own party may delay action for some weeks, according to a report by Politico on Thursday.\nIn addition, Bidens immigration package faces widespread opposition among Republicans. Numerous bipartisan negotiations among lawmakers over recent years to find an immigration compromise have collapsed.\nMayorkas said that the Trump administration had “gutted” the U.S. immigration system.\nHe also noted that the Biden administration did not “have the facilities available or equipped to administer the humanitarian laws that our Congress passed years ago.” \n“It takes time to rebuild an entire system and to process individuals at the border in a safe and just way,” he said.\nAlthough U.S. Customs and Border Protection has reported between 3,000 and 4,000 daily illegal crossings at the southern border, Mayorkas declined to call it a crisis.\n“This is a challenge that the border communities, the non-governmental organizations, the people who care for individuals seeking humanitarian relief all understand it is an imperative,” the secretary said. ”Everyone understands what occurred before us, what we need to do now.  And we are getting it done.” \nFor many in the Hispanic community, Biden’s recent actions are a welcome first step following the harsh immigration rules put in place by Trump under a “zero tolerance” policy. \nOne of the most visible and disturbing results of that earlier policy was an estimated 5,500 children separated from their parents at the border. Hundreds remain separated. \nDomingo Garcia, the national president of the League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC), believes that the Biden plan is important to open up legal immigration and citizenship to the estimated 11 million immigrants in the country who have not been able to use legal channels. \n“We need to get it done in this year, 2021,” Garcia told Capital News Service. “Time is of the essence with the elections two years away, when immigration can be turned into another political pinata and immigrants are used as a source to divide Americans. Its important that we get this off the table and move on to recovering from COVID and the economic questions weve had.”\nThe task force aimed at reunifying families at the border is led by Mayorkas and will receive input from first lady Dr. Jill Biden. \nMore than 600 children have been separated at the border from their parents for more than two years. \nGarcia believes the first step in making sure the reunification efforts work is making it clear that parents will not be arrested when picking up their children and that they will not be subject to deportation, which was happening under the Trump administration. \n“If those safeguards are in place, then actually all of those children can be reunited in 90 to 120 days,” he said. “Unfortunately, some of those parents have been deported back to their countries of origin, and that will be difficult, or complex, for unification.” \nWhen it comes to reassuring the Latino and Hispanic community that harmful orders against those wanting to emigrate here won’t be repeated, Garcia said, the Biden administration still must deal with  “thousands of refugees in squalor in refugee camps under the ‘Stay in Mexico’ order.” \n“The Trump administration committed horrific human rights abuses by separating families at the border,” Rep. Joaquin Castro, D-Texas, said in a statement. He is also head of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus.\n“I commend President Biden for immediately working to reunite these families and ensure these atrocities never happen again,” he said.\nCastro and Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Connecticut, are the authors of legislation that would grant lawful permanent resident status to eligible people who were separated by the Department of Homeland Security during the Trump years. \nProspects for comprehensive immigration changes remain poor. The partisan divide in Congress on the issue has not narrowed. Most GOP lawmakers have viewed Democratic efforts to reform immigration as too lenient and not focused enough on border security.\n“Biden wasted no time pulling out his pen and unraveling policies critical to our national security, border security, and immigration enforcement,” Rep. John Katko, R-New York, wrote last month on FoxNews.com. \nThe ranking Republican on the House Homeland Security Committee, Katko wrote: “From pausing deportations to halting border wall construction and ending the ‘Remain in Mexico’ policy, the president slapped an ‘open’ sign on our border – during a global pandemic.”\nSen. Tom Cotton, R-Arkansas, tweeted that the Biden plan amounted to “total amnesty, no regard for the health or security of Americans, and zero enforcement.”"

    "title": "Lawmakers launch new effort at tightening background checks on gun sales",
    "content": "Amidst a surge in firearms sales, lawmakers in the Senate and House have introduced legislation expanding background checks for all gun purchases.\n“Background checks are simple, easy, and they save lives. Thats why more than 90 percent of Americans support our legislation to make sure no guns are sold in this country without a background check,” Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Connecticut, and the lead sponsor of the background check measure in the Senate, said in a statement Tuesday.\nHis bill has 45 Democratic co-sponsors, including Maryland Sens. Ben Cardin and Chris Van Hollen.\n“If there is no background check, there should be no sale of a firearm,” Cardin said in a statement. “The goal is simple: keep guns out of the hands of people who shouldn’t be able to buy them.”\n“Gun violence has plagued too many families in Maryland and across the country. Universal background checks will save lives,” Van Hollen said in a statement.\nRep. Mike Thompson, D-California, introduced a similar bill in the House, where a background checks bill passed two years ago but then died in the then-Republican-controlled Senate. Thompson’s bill includes GOP co-sponsors and could be voted on as early as next week.\n“Time and time again, we have seen that the American people want universal background checks, in fact public polling shows that the majority of people, Democrats, Republicans and Independents, support this,” Thompson said in a statement.\nThe bills are aimed at closing the so-called “gun show loophole,” under which private gun sales  on the web, from homes and at gun shows  have not required federal background checks.\nAbout 20 percent of gun sales are conducted without background checks, according to the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence.\n“We need action to help stop the violence that claims over 100 lives every day and disproportionately affects Black and Brown communities,” Brady President Kris Brown said in a statement.\nThe National Rifle Association denounced the background check bills, saying on its website that the measures “would criminalize the private transfer of firearms.”\nThe lawmakers acted as President Joe Biden considers using executive orders to enact what he calls “common sense” gun control measures.\nBiden last month also called on Congress to toughen gun control laws, including not only requiring background checks on all gun sales, but also banning assault weapons and high-capacity magazines and eliminating legal immunity for gun manufacturers.\nBiden said his administration “will not wait for the next mass shooting” to act.\n“We will take action to end our epidemic of gun violence and make our schools and communities safer,” Biden said. “We owe it to all those we’ve lost and to all those left behind to grieve to make a change.”\nThe day chosen for his announcement was especially significant: (colon) as it was the third anniversary of the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, where 14 students and three staff members were killed.\nBiden has made clear that gun control measures are a top administration priority, consistent with a central theme of his presidential campaign.\nBiden and other administration officials already have met with several gun safety advocacy groups.\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-California, said that Democrats would work with the Biden White House to enact background check legislation. The Bipartisan Background Checks Act and the Enhanced Background Checks Act were both passed by House Democrats in 2019.\nMurphy has met with Susan Rice, director of the White House’s Domestic Policy Council, to discuss the stronger background checks. He has been a strong proponent of gun control since the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in his state. Twenty children and six adult staff members died in that tragedy.\nVarious gun control groups have praised the changes that Biden said he wants to make to gun laws.\n“Joe Biden ran on one of the strongest gun violence-related platforms of any candidate who’s run for president, especially in the general election,” said Adam Patrick, director of political communications for the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence. “He has supported extreme protection orders, universal background checks and for a long time he’s championed the assault weapons ban.”\nBiden isn’t new to fighting for gun control. In 1993, then-Sen. Biden worked to pass the Brady bill, which implemented the modern background check system that advocates are now pushing to reform. He also helped to create the 1994 assault weapons ban, which expired a decade later despite congressional supporters’ efforts to renew it.\nDespite the support from the Democratic members of Congress, Biden faces stiff opposition from most Republicans, especially in the Senate. Their party leaders have a history of blocking gun safety bills.\n“You look at the history of gun violence prevention, for a long time it was a third-rail issue,” Patrick said. “It is something that has evaded real action in Congress and has seen a lot of progress in the states. But people need federal laws.”\nDespite what has happened in the past, Patrick said the new proposals for greater gun safety have a better chance because the Democrats control both houses of Congress.\nBut public support for change has waned a bit. According to a Nov 16 Gallup Poll, public support for stricter gun laws is at the lowest level since 2016. Fifty-seven percent of respondents supported stricter gun laws, 9 percent wanted less strict laws, while 34 percent wanted no changes.\nThe FBI said it processed a record 39.7 million firearms background checks in 2020, the highest annual number since the agency started recording this data in 1998.\nEven if enacted, new gun laws also are likely to be challenged in the courts. And some local law enforcement officials have said they wouldn’t enforce new gun restrictions.\nSheriff Richard Mack of Arizona, founder of the Constitutional Sheriffs  Peace Officers Association (CSPOA), said that gun control is unlawful.\n“You would think that somebody that’s been in Washington, D.C., for 47 years would know that gun control is against the law of the United States of America and that he swore an oath to uphold and defend the Constitution,” Mack said, referring to Biden.\nMack’s group represents more than 1,000 officers across the country. According to Mack, the majority of them refuse to enforce any gun control laws that might be implemented, adding that he and his allies “will not violate the Bill of Rights.”\nBut other law enforcement groups, such as the Major Cities Chiefs Association and the International Association of Chiefs of Police, as well as many mayors and other local officials, have called for tighter gun laws. Survivors of mass shootings and parents of mass shooting victims also have mobilized to join with gun safety groups to press for new laws.\nFormer President Barack Obama weighed in on Twitter last week: “Even as we focus on fighting COVID-19, it’s important to recognize that there’s another pandemic raging right now—one that’s decades in the making and unique to the United States. We need to treat gun violence with the same urgency and resolve.”\nFred Guttenberg, whose daughter Jaime was killed in the Parkland shooting, tweeted back, thanking Obama.\n“The urgency to deal with gun violence has never been greater,” he wrote. “I look forward to working with @POTUS @JoeBiden to start this work and to save lives.”"

    "title": "Biden’s COVID relief plan includes $130 billion to help schools reopen",
    "content": "President Joe Biden’s $130 billion school reopening plan focuses on making schools safer for teachers and students, although returning to school remains a contentious and difficult issue.\nReopening the majority of K-8 schools within his first 100 days in office is a key part of the president’s $1.9 trillion “American Rescue Plan” passed by the House on Friday on a party-line vote and now under consideration in the Senate.\n“We can do this if we give the school districts, the schools themselves, the communities, and the states the clear guidance they need, as well as the resources they need that they can’t afford right now because of the economic dilemma we are in,” Biden said in January. \nSupporters of the rescue measure will need every one of the 50 Democratic senators to vote for it. Under a procedural process known as reconciliation, a tie-breaking vote by Vice President Kamala Harris vote would allow the package to pass by a simple majority vote.\nSafety measures such as social-distancing and mask-wearing are put into place for students and teachers at schools that are reopening. (Kaitlyn Cupelli/Capital News Service)\nAlthough congressional Republicans also are supportive of returning kids to school, many do not support Biden’s $1.9 trillion relief plan. \nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, said in a statement after the House vote that Democrats “jammed through a bill that even liberal economists and editorial boards say is not well targeted to this stage of the fight.”\n“More than a third of its spending, including more than 90% of the K-12 school funding, would not even go out this fiscal year,” he said.\nThe back-to-school plan calls for more COVID-19 testing and transportation, additional cleaning and sanitizing services, protective equipment, and ventilation systems in schools. School districts could also use funds to take additional safety measures such as:\n\nReducing class sizes so students and teachers can maintain social distance; \nHiring more janitors and implementing mitigation measures; \nEnsuring every school has access to a nurse; \nHiring counselors to support students as they transition back to the classroom;\nClosing the digital divide that has amplified inequalities during the pandemic;\nProviding summer schools for students who have lost learning time;\nPreventing cuts to state pre-k programs. \n\nThe COVID-19 Educational Equity Challenge Grant will also be funded by the Biden plan, said Christian Unkenholz, spokesman for Rep. Anthony Brown, D-Largo. The grant will support state, local and tribal governments in working with teachers and families to respond to COVID-related educational challenges.\n“This is a question of justice and equity,” Brown said. “Without this aid, our schools, students and educators will be left to fend for themselves, potentially further delaying the return to in-classroom instruction and leaving kids behind. That’s unacceptable.”\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has particularly hurt lower-income students, Black and Latino students, and students with disabilities, according to the U.S. Department of Education. \nThe pandemic also has led to increased absences, poor learning outcomes, more hungry kids, and more social isolation.\nResearch on disrupted instruction shows that the cumulative learning loss for students by the end of the 2020-2021 school year could equate to five to nine months on average, said Lora Rakowski, director of communications for the Maryland Department of Education.\n“Many students rely on our school system for food,” Joe Weedon, a member of the Washington Teachers’ Union, told Capital News Service.  “(Our schools) assure they have safe places so they can focus on their work.” \nThousands of Washington students returned to school on Feb. 2 as part of the city’s public schools’ expansion of in-person classroom learning. Twenty-three million dollars was used to prepare buildings for the return to schools, Weedon said, although he said he still has serious concerns about the readiness of a number of facilities.\nMany District of Columbia schools have not yet released data about the quality of their air systems, so it is unknown if the buildings meet the nation’s air release guidelines, Weedon said. Teachers are also only just beginning to receive vaccinations, meaning very few individuals have immunity from COVID-19 at this point.\nWith hybrid-learning, teachers will be asked to do a lot more work, as they will have to teach partially from home and partially at school  a change that they are not used to, Weedon said. He added that the District’s current return-to-school is not a return to normal, but a return to the safety of their school buildings.\n“We’d all love a return to normal, but we are still in a pandemic,” Weedon said.\nMaryland Gov. Larry Hogan, a Republican, also has submitted a $1.5 billion supplemental budget focused on education. \n“This supplemental budget provides further support for the safe reopening of Maryland schools,” Hogan said. “I want to commend all the teachers, administrators, parents, and public health officials who are doing everything they can to give Maryland students the chance to get back in the classrooms safely.”\nThe budget includes: \n\n$931 million to support local school systems and targeted assistance for the safe reopening of public schools.\n$434 million in additional funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and the Pandemic EBT program. This program is intended to help families in Maryland purchase food while schools remain closed due to COVID-19\n$128 million to support the state’s Child Care Scholarship program, including almost $60 million to help support licensed child care providers recover from the impact of the pandemic.\n$35 million from the Governor’s Emergency Education Relief Fund to support the safe reopening of nonpublic schools.\n$20 million from the same fund to support community colleges, private institutions of higher education, and competitive innovation grants.\n\nBy the end of March, 18 out of 24 Maryland school systems will be providing an opportunity for in-person instruction at least two days a week, in elementary, middle and high school grade levels, Rakowski said. \nCarroll, Worcester, Calvert, Caroline, Cecil, Dorchester, Frederick, Queen Anne’s, St. Mary’s, Somerset, Talbot, Washington and Wicomico Counties are among the local school systems currently providing in-person, hybrid instruction.\nFour local school systems are not opening for all grade levels by the end of March, Rakowski said. \nHarford County schools are open for elementary K-5 for two days, but only one day for middle and high school students. Baltimore City will open for elementary, K-5 and grades six and nine by the end of March. Charles County has a five-phase reopening plan and will start phase five on March 22, allowing special populations of students to meet in-person four days a week. Prince George’s County will open some of its schools for the month of April. \nAs more schools re-open, the Maryland State Education Association has developed a checklist of expectations for every school building, utilizing CDC, Department of Health, and Department of Education health and safety guidelines.\nCheryl Bost, MSEA president and a Baltimore County elementary school teacher, said she believes accelerating the availability of vaccines to teachers, as well as following safety guidelines like adequate ventilation and social distancing, are key to protecting the health of students, educators, and families.\n“We all want to be in school, safely and sustainably, with our students,” Bost told CNS. “That’s been our goal all along.”"

    "title": "D.C. statehood backers mobilize behind legislation that faces tough odds",
    "content": "Advocates for making the District of Columbia the 51st state have introduced bills with record numbers of sponsors in Congress, but it still will take a hefty effort to win a final victory on an issue that has dogged the nation’s capital since its founding.\nThe groundwork has been laid in the House, where Rep. Eleanor Holmes Norton, D-District of Columbia, won passage of a statehood bill for the first time last June and has amassed 212 co-sponsors.\nThe House Oversight and Reform Committee will hold a hearing on District statehood on March 11. Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser will be among the proponents appearing before the panel.\nThe Senate is where the real fight may be. Sen. Tom Carper, D-Delaware, has a record 39 cosponsors on his bill, but that means that 11 of his Democratic colleagues are not yet on board, not to mention any Republicans. Under current Senate rules, it would take 60 votes to stop an almost certain filibuster from GOP senators.\nCarper’s struggle to gain Republican supporters stems from the fact that if the District of Columbia was to gain statehood, it would put two more Democrats in the Senate.\nSome of the most vocal Republican opponents in the Senate have been Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, Tom Cotton of Arkansas and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina.\n“They see it purely in power terms,” Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Maryland, told Capital News Service. “They are worried about more Democratic senators being added to the Senate.”\nStatehood for the District  and perhaps as well for Puerto Rico  amounted to “full-bore socialism on the march,” McConnell said on Fox News last year.\nCarper, who has introduced a statehood bill in every Congress since 2013, along with Norton have been some of the biggest activists for District statehood.\n“Despite paying more in federal taxes per capita than citizens of any of the 50 states, D.C. residents have no say in how those taxes are actually spent. This isn’t a Republican or Democratic issue; it’s an American issue,” Carper said in a statement after introducing his bill.\nLast June, the House passed a statehood bill for the first time. However, it was never taken up in the Senate due to widespread opposition from Republicans, who then still held the majority.\nNorton has argued to those who think the District, with a population of 700,000, is too small that “there are more than half a dozen jurisdictions that have two senators with the same population.”\nNorton said her time in the House has been spent working with “one arm behind her back.” She has proposed legislation in the past on a variety of issues to help the District, but ultimately measures failed in the Senate due to a lack of representation and voting power. Statehood would put her and the District of Columbia on a more even playing field, she has said.\nWith a record 212 cosponsors on her bill and only 218 votes needed to pass in the House, Norton said this is a sure sign of success to come. \n“The bill was most important to turn around the notion that Americans think we have the same rights that everyone else has,” Norton told CNS.\nNorton has turned to several Democratic senators for help, including Van Hollen, who said it is important to build public support. But he believes abolishing the filibuster rule will be statehood advocates’ best strategy.\nAlong with Carper and Norton, Van Hollen thinks the statehood movement is gaining momentum.\nVan Hollen said the federal government’s indifference to the District’s needs makes statehood that more urgent.\n“No other jurisdiction in the country would accept this type of intrusion that the government is doing to the District of Columbia,” Van Hollen said.\nThe Jan. 6 attack on the United States Capitol showed how the District’s lack of statehood denied Bowser powers that every mayor and governor in the United States possesses. \nShe did not have the direct authority to call in the National Guard to help U.S. Capitol Police and District Police repel the rioters.\nBowser and other advocates, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-California, have cited the day’s tragic events as a prime example of why the District should be granted statehood.\n“Generations of Washingtonians have been denied the right to participate in our democracy,” Bowser said in a statement.\nBowser has said she hopes to have the District of Columbia statehood bill on President Joe Biden’s desk within his first 100 days in office."

    "title": "Biden taps three for Postal Service board; signals possible move on DeJoy ",
    "content": "President Joe Biden on Wednesday nominated three people to fill vacancies on the United States Postal Service Board of Governors.\nThe nominations came the same day Postmaster General Louis DeJoy apologized to a congressional panel about poor mail service but insisted the problems existed before he took over the USPS.\nCongressional Democrats have written letters and publicly called on the president to fill board vacancies in a move that could ultimately result in DeJoy being out of a job. \nThe board vacancies were a major topic of debate during a hearing Wednesday of the House Oversight and Reform Committee. \nRon Bloom, the board chairman, told lawmakers that the board has lacked full attendance for at least six or seven years. The 11-member board has nine members in staggered terms chosen by the president. The board selects the postmaster general, and then the board and the postmaster general appoint the deputy postmaster general (a position also currently vacant).\nAs the board is currently made up of six white males, Rep. Cori Bush, D-Missouri, called for diversity.\n“An agency of over 640,000 employees that come from every walk of life and serve the entire American public should have representation at the top reflective of the broader American population,” she said. \nShe asked DeJoy:  “Do you see it as a problem that the Board of Governors for the United States Postal Service looks like a millionaire white boys club?”\nIt appears that Biden’s nominees are intended to address that lack of diversity and all have some degree of experience with the postal industry.\nAnton Hajjar is the former general counsel of the American Postal Workers Union (APWU) and has also served as an advisor and pro bono attorney in employment discrimination cases.\nAmber McReynolds is the CEO of the National Vote at Home Institute, a non-partisan non-profit dedicated to expanding and improving vote-by-mail systems in all fifty states.\nThe third nominee, Ronald Stroman, recently served as deputy postmaster general and chief governmental relations officer for the USPS.\nBiden’s nominees will have to be confirmed by the Senate. If approved, the newly-filled board could move in the direction Democrats are hoping for  adding two men of color and a woman  and create a majority to take action to replace DeJoy, a donor to former President Donald Trump.\nDeJoy maintained that many of the problems at the Postal Service existed long before he became postmaster general.\n“The years of financial stress, under-investment, unachievable service standards and lack of operational precision have resulted in a system that does not have adequate resilience to adjust and adapt to changing circumstances,” he said.\nSome committee members were less than impressed with his perspective.\nRep. Jamie Raskin, D-Kensington, scoffed at DeJoy’s plan to lengthen mail delivery times. \n“It sounds like your solution to the problems you’ve identified is to surrender,” Raskin said. “Because the mail has been late under your leadership we’re just gonna change the standards and build it into the system that it will be late.”\nThroughout the hearing, DeJoy alluded to a “strategic plan.” He told Rep. Kweisi Mfume, D-Baltimore, that plan would be ready in the next two weeks and that he is “always happy” to return before the committee and explain the details of it.\nBut Rep, Katie Porter, D-California, was skeptical.\n“Ive heard that you have a new strategic plan, but Im really concerned that this plan may neither be strategic nor a plan,” she said.\nEarlier in the day, redesigned Postal Service delivery trucks were unveiled and are set to replace current vehicles that are, on average, 25 years old. The “next generation delivery vehicle” is set to take to the streets in 2023 and will include increased safety features – shockingly, airbags – and more cargo space. Some of the fleet also will be electric.\nAnother issue facing the Postal Service is Medicare integration for Postal Service employees. \nThe USPS is the only agency required to pre-fund employees’ retirement funds. Only 73 percent of Postal Service retirees are enrolled in the program, and if the Medicare integration is passed it would require current employees to enroll once they turn 65.\nRep. Carolyn Maloney, D-New York, and chairwoman of the panel, said that Medicare integration would save the USPS $10 billion over the next 10 years, to which DeJoy said that projections on his end show at least $30 billion in savings over that same time frame.\nEach witness, including Bloom and Mark Dimondstein, president of the APWU, announced support for Medicare integration."

    "title": "What&#8217;s next for the struggling U.S. Postal Service?",
    "content": "Almost two months into the new year, the U.S. Postal Service is still juggling massive delays, budget issues and operational challenges, compounded by the many obstacles of 2020.\nUnder fire from congressional critics and the general public, Postmaster General and CEO Louis DeJoy was defensive at a Feb. 9 meeting of the Postal Service’s Board of Governors. And some lawmakers want him gone. \n“Unlike many who care to offer suggestions about the Postal Service, I offer that the future of the Postal Service must not be about assigning blame,” DeJoy told the board. “It must be about finding solutions and implementing them –and that is what our Board, our management team and I plan to do.”\nDuring the holiday season, notably the peak season for post offices, the USPS processed and delivered a record number of packages – more than 1.1 billion – despite the challenge of operating in a global pandemic. \nWhen FedEx and UPS increased shipping restrictions because of the pandemic, the Postal Service says it never turned away a package. \n“As Americans are urged to stay home, the importance of the mail will only grow as people, including those in rural areas and senior citizens, will need access to vital communications, essential packages and other necessities,” Postal Service spokeswoman Martha Johnson said in a statement.\nBut in many communities across the nation, postal deliveries have been  and remain  abysmal. First Class letters have taken weeks to cross a single state. Packages have taken months to travel distances as short as a three-hour car ride.\nSeemingly everyone has been impacted on some level by the Postal Service’s struggles. \nYadira Keen Santos of Annapolis said in a direct message on Twitter that she experienced mail delays impacting her mortgage payments. Santos did not receive her December mortgage statement until the end of January.\n“I still have not gotten Jan. and Feb. will probably get to me by April at the speed this is going,” she said. “Of course it goes the other way too. They did not receive my Dec. payment that was sent 12/9 until 1/27.”\nDuring the week of Dec. 26, only 64 percent of First Class mail was delivered on time, while the rate was just 45 percent for periodicals, according to a Feb. 17 letter to DeJoy from 34 Democratic senators.\n“Our constituents have experienced missed paychecks and court notices, delayed critical prescriptions, an inability to reach small business customers and suppliers, lost rent payments and delayed credit card payments resulting in late fees, breakdowns in service to their communities, late personal mail such as holiday packages and more,” the senators wrote.\nIt is your duty, first and foremost, to protect service and ensure timely mail delivery for every person in this nation, the letter said. We demand that you not make additional changes that will harm service for the American people. \nOne of the senators on the letter, Maryland’s Chris Van Hollen, thinks DeJoy, a donor to former President Donald Trump, is “still wreaking havoc” and needs to be removed.\nIn a campaign fundraising email Friday, Van Hollen charged that “DeJoy is now planning to slow down delivery times even further while raising postage rates.”\nOther congressional Democrats also have called on President Joe Biden to fill vacancies on the board of governors to ultimately oust DeJoy. \nWhile the 11-member board appoints the postmaster general, the president has the authority to appoint nine of the boards members. Currently there are three vacancies on the board, along with the deputy postmaster position.\nEighty House Democrats, including Maryland Rep. John Sarbanes of Towson, wrote Biden a week ago urging him to give those vacancies his immediate attention.\nWe do not doubt that the Postal Service requires some thoughtful reforms in order to continue to provide excellent service to the American people in the years to come; however, there is a plethora of evidence that Postmaster General DeJoy is not equipped to meet the rigors of these challenges, the lawmakers told the president.\nDeJoy generated a furor last summer when he announced a slowdown in mail deliveries, cancelled overtime and dismantled automated mail sorting machines. Critics feared the moves would affect the vast volume of mail-in ballots in the November presidential election. DeJoy suspended further changes in October.\nThe USPS has been included in various COVID-19 legislation from Congress, including December’s relief bill that converted $10 billion in an additional borrowing authority loan into direct emergency relief. Previously, the Postal Service would have been required to repay this loan. \nThe American Postal Workers Union has been grateful.\n“Together with the efforts of our national, state and local leaders and activists,” said union President Mark Dimondstein, “our retirees and the APWU auxiliary, as well as many friends in both sides of the aisle in Congress, there was never a moment that Congress could ignore the APWU’s priorities in the relief debate.”\nAs Congress negotiates the contents of the next COVID relief bill, which House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-California, hopes will be passed by the end of the month, the USPS said retiree health insurance is of utmost importance to its 664,000 workers. \n“Medicare integration continues to be the top priority proposal we are advancing to improve coverage and cost and to align our retiree health funding practices with other government entities and the private sector,” Johnson said.\nThe change would provide much-needed financial stability for the USPS, according to officials.\nAt the Board of Governors meeting, DeJoy apologized to all Americans who “felt the impact of our delays.”\nBut he promised three critical components to his 10-year plan: keeping six-days-a-week delivery, providing employees with the tools and training to ensure long-term careers, and investing in vehicles, technology and equipment."

    "content": "WASHINGTON –  While a bipartisan Senate majority on Saturday found former President Donald Trump guilty of inciting the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol, the votes fell short of the necessary threshold to convict him, and ultimately Trump was acquitted for a historic second time.\nThe 57-43 vote for conviction included seven GOP senators voting with the Democrats: Richard Burr of North Carolina, Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Mitt Romney of Utah, Ben Sasse of Nebraska, R-Neb., and Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania.\nIt was the most bipartisan Senate impeachment vote in history.\n\nSaturdays proceedings concluded the second impeachment trial of Trump in just over a year.\n\nOn Feb. 5 last year, the Senate acquitted Trump, on nearly-party line votes, of two articles of impeachment charging him with abuse of power and obstruction of Congress.\nSaturday’s trial began with the Senate unexpectedly voting with a 55-45 majority to call witnesses to the impeachment trial, causing confusion on the next steps and threatening a prolonged trial. After an hour-long recess in which lawyers agreed to enter a witness statement as evidence instead of calling witnesses, closing statements ensued.\n“This is almost certainly how you will be remembered by history,” Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Kensington, said. “We must recognize and exercise these crimes against our nation, and then we must take care of our people, and our children, and their hearts and their minds.”\nThe House managers’ appeal to emotions were effective, but party politics and the question of the impeachment trial being constitutional led many GOP senators to vote “not guilty.”\nThe first vote of the day came after lead House manager Raskin called for the subpoena of Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler, R-Washington, who publicly described a phone call between Trump and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-California, during the deadly Capitol assault.\nIn this call that was later relayed to Herrera Beutler and other Republican lawmakers, McCarthy reportedly told Trump that the rioters were his supporters, not antifa, to which Trump replied: “Well, Kevin, I guess these people are more upset about the election than you are.”\nFollowing Raskin’s request for Herrera Beutler, Trump defense attorney Michael van der Veen responded, pressing either to end the trial or, if witnesses were allowed, time to collect “over 100 depositions” including from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-California, and Vice President Kamala Harris.\nNone of these depositions should be done by Zoom. We didnt do this hearing by Zoom. These depositions should be done in person, in my office, in Philly-delphia, van der Veen said, resulting in laughter in the chamber.\nFive GOP senators voted for the calling of witnesses. Collins, Murkowski, Romney and Sasse  were joined by Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, who initially voted no, but then changed his vote to “aye.”\nImmediately after the vote, though, the Senate descended into confusion over what the vote was actually for.\nAn hour later, an agreement had been made to avoid calling witnesses, and instead enter Herrera Beutler’s official statement as evidence to the case.\nHouse managers’ closing remarks had an emotional impact, as did most of their presentations throughout the week, emphasizing that the nation’s identity could be defined by a Trump acquittal.\n“This cannot be the beginning. It can’t be the new normal. It has to be the end, and that decision is in your hands,” Rep. Joe Neguse, D-California, told senators.\n\nThe House managers reviewed their case material from earlier this week, revisiting their arguments that it was Trump’s incendiary rhetoric about a stolen election leading up to the Jan. 6 attack that led his supporters to believe they had been invited to Washington and march on the Capitol.\n\nAlternatively, Trump’s counsel reverted to oft-repeated objections over the constitutionality of the trial.\n“This impeachment has been a complete charade from beginning to end… nothing but the unhinged pursuit of a longstanding political vendetta against Mr. Trump by the opposition party,” van der Veen said.\nRaskin’s fiery rebuttal to van der Veen summed up the prosecution’s argument.\n“We’re defending the U.S. Senate and the U.S. House against a president who acted no better than a marauder and a member of that mob by inciting those people to come here, and in many ways he was worse,” Raskin said. “He named the date, he named the time, and he brought them here, and now, he must pay the price.”\nImmediately following Trump’s acquittal, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-New York, criticized the acquittal.\n“The former president inspired, directed, and propelled a mob to violently prevent the peaceful transfer of power, subvert the will of the people, and illegally keep that president in power, Schumer said in remarks on the Senate floor. “There is nothing, nothing more un-American than that.”\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, spoke directly after Schumer, harshly condemning Trump’s actions.\n“There’s no question – none – that President Trump is practically and morally responsible for provoking the events of the day. No question about it,” McConnell said despite voting “not guilty” moments before.\nMcConnell justified his vote by citing the Constitution’s impeachment article, which he said precluded a Senate trial because Trump was no longer in office and a private citizen when the House delivered the impeachment articles to the Senate. But it was McConnell who refused to call the Senate back into session to try Trump before he left office on Jan. 20.\n“Its the president, its the vice president and civil officers,” McConnell said, explaining who the Constitution subjected to impeachment and trial. “We have no power to convict and disqualify a former office holder who is now a private citizen.\nRaskin took McConnell’s statements and the bipartisan voting as a sign that the House managers proved their case.\n“He described it as we did, as a disgraceful dereliction of duty, a desertion of his office,” Raskin told reporters. “Trump stormed our House with the mob he incited and we defended our House. He violated our Constitution and we defended the Constitution.”\nSen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Maryland, said in a statement that the House managers presented overwhelming evidence of Trump’s guilt.\n“To my Republican colleagues who voted to acquit, I ask, if Trump’s conduct was not a crime against the Constitution, what is?” Van Hollen said.\nTrump also issued a statement after his acquittal, hinting at future political activity.\n“Our historic, patriotic and beautiful movement to Make American Great Again has only just begun,” the former president said. “In the months ahead I have much to share with you, and I look forward to continuing our incredible journey together to achieve American greatness for all of our people,” he said.\nMore than 200 individuals allegedly involved in the Jan. 6 attack have been arrested and are facing independent legal proceedings, in which Trump’s role in encouraging the insurrection could be a central issue."

    "title": "Trump&#8217;s defense opens and closes; Senate may vote on conviction Saturday",
    "content": "Former president Donald Trump’s legal team began and completed their defense on Friday, arguing that their client’s words were protected by the First Amendment, that he was not given fair access to due process and that impeaching him would set a dangerous precedent as well as disenfranchise millions of voters who share his political beliefs.Trump’s lawyers had 16 hours to present their case, but yielded their time after just over three hours. In their case, the defense leaned its case on legal precedent, edited videos of Democrats pledging to “fight” for various issues, and attacks on the House managers’ evidence.A central focus of the defense’s argument was the political rhetoric that Trump used in his Jan. 6 speech. While the House managers made the case that this speech was the final piece of months of incendiary language before the deadly insurrection at the United States Capitol, the defense argued that similar rhetoric is used regularly by Democratic politicians.The defense team presented a nearly 10-minute-long video of edited clips depicting Democratic politicians, ranging from President Joe Biden to Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Massachusetts, (as well as non-politicians like Madonna and Johnny Depp) using language that the defense argued was is similar to Trump’s rhetoric. This video was referenced several times throughout the defense’s case.Michael van der Veen, one of Trump’s defense lawyers, called the impeachment trial a “witch hunt,” politically motivated, and a product of “constitutional cancel culture.” He asserted that Antifa was a driving force behind the Jan. 6 insurrection, saying the mob was composed of extremists of various different stripes and political persuasions who pre-planned and premeditated an attack on the Capitol.If Trump can be convicted regarding his speech and actions regarding the insurrection, no political speech will be safe, and politicians would now face the threat of impeachment for any speech, van der Veen warned. “I am not showing you this video as some excuse for Mr. Trump’s speech, this is not ‘whataboutism’, I am showing you this to make the point that all political speech must be protected,” van der Veen said. “Let us be clear,” he said, “this trial is about far more than President Trump. It is about silencing and banning the speech that the majority does not agree with. It is about cancelling 75 million Trump voters and criminalizing political viewpoints.”A critical moment in the day’s proceedings came early in the question-and-answer session after the defense closed. Trump’s lawyers were unable to offer evidence that the then-president did anything to mount a response to the Capitol attack or defend his own vice president.Sens. Susan Collins, R-Maine, and Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, asked Trump’s legal team: Exactly when did President Trump learn of the breach at the Capitol? What specific actions did he take to end the rioting, and when did he take them? Please be as specific as possible. Trump’s attorneys refused to answer the question before finally insisting that House managers gave them no evidence, that they “pieced together a timeline” and that Trump was denied due process. Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, asked Trump’s team: “When President Trump sent the disparaging tweet at 2:24 p.m. regarding Vice President (Mike) Pence, was he aware that the vice president had been removed from the Senate by the Secret Service for his safety?” Van der Veen maintained that at no point was the president informed the vice president was in any danger.”However, Sen. Tommy Tuberville, R-Alabama, said he specifically informed the president in a brief phone call during the insurrection that Pence had to be evacuated from the chamber because he was in danger. The senator repeated his assertion to reporters after Friday’s session adjourned, according to multiple news outlets.\nCNN reported Friday night that a source close to Pence said Trumps lawyers were not telling the truth when they said the president did not know the vice president was in danger during the Capitol attack.\nThe network also reported that Trump and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-California, had a volatile phone call during the attack. When McCarthy asked the president to call off his supporters, Trump replied: Well, Kevin, I guess these people are more upset about the election than you are, according to lawmakers familiar with the exchange.\nDefense lawyer David Schoen displayed images of tweets used during the House managers’ presentation, saying they had been doctored.Schoen argued that Democrats manipulated evidence and selectively edited footage’” to make their points. Schoen also claimed in his defense that Democrats’ hatred for Trump had infected the impeachment trial; he said that Democrats withheld footage of the siege in the Capitol that was important to criminal trials for political points, that they had tampered with footage and didn’t present enough evidence.A third Trump lawyer, Bruce Castor, insisted Trump cannot be convicted for inciting violence against the government because the insurrection in question was not an insurrection after all because it was not successful. “Insurrection is a term of art defined in the law,” Castor said. “It involves taking over a country, a shadow government, taking the TV stations over and having some plan on what you’re going to do when you finally take power.” When Congress resumed its proceedings on the night of the insurrection, however, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, described the days events as a failed insurrection.The defense team rested with Castor saying he wouldn’t use all of his time so the Senate can use the unused hours to focus on the delivery of COVID relief to the American people.The House managers and Trump’s defense lobbed sharp remarks at each other during their responses to senators’ questions. Instead of answering a question, van der Veen accused Rep. Joaquin Castro, D-Texas, of misrepresenting a tweet from Trump and intentionally misleading the American people. After the defense also claimed it had not seen evidence or had access to evidence, lead House manager Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Kensington, appeared exasperated: “Rather than yelling at us and screaming about how we didn’t have time to get all of the facts about what your client did, bring your client up here and have him testify under oath about why he was sending out tweets denouncing the vice president of the United States while the vice president was being hunted down by a mob that wanted to hang him and was chanting, in this building, ‘Hang Mike Pence!’”In the only moment of bipartisan unity and good feeling, the Senate unanimously passed legislation to award U.S. Capitol Police Officer Eugene Goodman the Congressional Gold Medal for his role in protecting lawmakers during the attack.Goodman, who stood at the back of the room on watchful guard over Congress once again, was given a standing ovation by all the senators.“I think we can all agree that Eugene Goodman deserves the highest honor Congress can bestow,” said Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-New York.“If not for the bravery and quick thinking of Officer Eugene Goodman, in particular, people in this chamber may not have escaped that day unharmed,” McConnell said.The medal is the highest accolade Congress can award for distinguished achievements and contributions.The Senate reconvenes Saturday at 10 a.m. for closing arguments and a vote on whether Trump should be convicted on a single article of impeachment charging him with inciting an attack on the government. A conviction requires 67 votes."

    "title": "Senators warned a Trump acquittal would embolden future challenges to democracy",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  House impeachment managers on Thursday closed their arguments for convicting former President Donald Trump on a charge of inciting an insurrection by warning the Senate that an acquittal would embolden that same president, should he return, or a successor to mount a future violent challenge to the democratic process.\nEnding the trial’s second day, the House managers depicted Trump as a candidate and president who regularly used violent rhetoric in speeches to supporters and in tweets, a pattern of behavior that ultimately led to the deadly Jan. 6 on the United States Capitol.\nIn the hours and weeks after the assault, Trump has shown no signs of regretting his language, Rep. Ted Lieu, D-California, told senators.\n“Im a former prosecutor and was trained to recognize lack of remorse but it doesnt take a prosecutor to recognize lack of remorse, he was showing defiance,” Lieu said. “President Trumps lack of remorse shows that he will undoubtedly cause future harm if allowed because he still refuses to account for his previous high grave crime against our government.”\nRep. Diane DeGette, D-Colorado, said Trump did more than simply inspire the insurrectionists during his speech just before the attack  he directly ordered them to take action.\nThe mob, DeGette said, made it clear to law enforcement outside the Capitol that they were simply following Trump’s orders. Video evidence also showed attackers fervently chanting “Fight for Trump,” “Invade the Capitol Building” and “Storm the Capitol.\nTrump’s supporters “thought they were following orders from the commander-in-chief, DeGette said. And so they would not be punished.\n\nSome insurrectionists who have been arrested and charged are now having second thoughts, according to court filings, saying they felt deceived by Trump after the president initially began to distance himself from the protesters following the riot.\nJacob Chansley, whose horned hat and painted face was photographed and filmed and shown nationwide, expressed his regret following the attacks, claiming that he had “been duped by the president,” according to a statement made by his attorney.\nThe January insurrection left at least seven people dead (two police officers took their lives after the attack) and over 150 people injured, according to DeGette.\nDuring the attack, Trump did nothing to help the members of Congress and law enforcement besieged by the assault he incited, DeGette said.\nRep. Jamie Raskin, D-Kensington, the lead House manager, said the warnings were clear for months. He cited the attack on the Michigan State Capitol in late April 2020, alleging it was a “dress rehearsal” for last month’s Capitol attack.\nShowing video footage from Michigan’s attack, prosecutors emphasized that many of the attackers’ rhetoric was similar to those at the Capitol  shouting at police officers and calling them “traitors” and “cowards.” Attackers also shouted chants like “Heil Hitler.”\nRaskin said the video evidence and published articles proved that Trump never condemned the repeated violence executed by his supporters in Michigan. Instead, the then-president praised the mob attackers and referred to them all as “very good people.”\nLieu said Trump also lied about his role in dealing with the Jan. 6 Capitol attack.\nAccording to Lieu, Trump claimed to have deployed the National Guard once the riot broke out, but he actually called them in two hours later, around 3 p.m. The National Guard did not arrive on-scene until after 5pm.\nWhen the guard was deployed, the Pentagon had released a statement showing the list of individuals who were consulted before deploying the troops. Several people were on that list, including Vice President Mike Pence. President Trump was not on that list, Lieu said.\nIn fact, Lieu said, Trump intended for the insurrection to happen and was “delighted” at the events, going so far as tweeting more derogatory comments about Pence even after he knew his vice president was in danger. It took Trump an entire day after the attack to condemn the violence and actions of his supporters, the congressman said.\n“It took President Trump three days before he lowered the flag of the United States of America… President Trump, who was commander-in-chief at the time, did not attend and pay respects to the officer who lay in state in the very building that he died defending,” Lieu added.\nTrump’s legal team begins its defense Friday. House managers anticipated that one line of argument would be that Trump’s remarks before the attack were protected by the First Amendment.\n\n\n\nBut Trump’s violent rhetoric is not protected by the Constitution, Rep. Joe Neguse, D-Colorado, told the senators.\n“Its about his refusal to accept the outcome of the election, and his decision to incite an insurrection and theres no serious argument that the First Amendment protects that, and it would be extraordinarily dangerous for the United States Senate,” Neguse said.\n“We humbly ask you,” Neguse said, “to convict President Trump for the crime which he is overwhelmingly guilty of, because if we pretend this didnt happen, if it goes unanswered whos to say it wont happen again?”\nThe House managers emphasized that they weren’t seeking a criminal or civil punishment for Trump, but insisted the Senate had to set a precedent that presidents are held accountable for their words and the violence they may cause.\nRaskin closed the prosecution’s presentation with slightly updated and revised words of Thomas Paine in his pamphlet The Crisis: “These are the times that try men and women’s souls. The summer soldier and the sunshine patriot will shrink at this moment from the service of their cause and their country, but everyone who stands with us now will win the love and the favor and the affection of every man and every woman for all time. Tyranny, like hell, is not easily conquered; but we have this saving consolation, the more difficult the struggle, the more glorious in the end will be our victory.”\nRaskin added: “Good luck in your deliberations.”\nAfter the defense’s presentation, which will be given up to 16 hours, senators will have the opportunity to submit written questions to both sides."

    "title": "Senators hear evidence tying Trump to Capitol attack and mob hunt for Pence, Pelosi",
    "content": "WASHINGTON – New video footage presented by House impeachment managers shows how close United States Capitol rioters came to members of Congress on Jan. 6 as the second impeachment trial of former President Donald Trump began Wednesday.\nDel. Stacey Plaskett, D-Virgin Islands, and Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-California, introduced Capitol security camera footage showing former Vice President Mike Pence and his family being rushed out of danger by the Secret Service, fleeing a mob only 58 feet away that was chanting “Hang Mike Pence.”\nThe House managers at the Senate trial essentially argued that Trump encouraged an assassination attempt on his own vice president.\nRep. Joaquin Castro, D-Texas, told the Senate that this hostility toward Pence came from Trump himself. During his Jan. 6 midday speech to a crowd of his supporters, Trump mentioned Pence in less than flattering terms 11 times. He also tweeted at 2:24 p.m.  over an hour into the attack on the Capitol  that “Mike Pence didn’t have the courage to do what should have been done to protect our Country and our Constitution…”\nCastro then showed a video of a mob member reciting Trump’s exact words into a bullhorn so the rest of the crowd could hear it.\n“Some of these insurgents were heard saying they hope to find Vice President Mike Pence and execute him by hanging him from a Capitol Hill tree as a traitor,” Castro said, followed by a picture of a gallows with a noose that was made by the rioters for Pence. “This is what Donald Trump incited.”\nOther footage showed the insurgents searching feverishly for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-California. At one point, members of the mob could be heard calling for “Nancy, Nancy!”\nMore previously unseen security footage showed Capitol Police Officer Eugene Goodman, known now for leading a mob away from Senate chamber doors, warning Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, about the incoming rioters. Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-New York, was just two yards from the mob, Swalwell said, before he was rushed back to safety.\nCapitol Police Officer Daniel Hodges was also shown being attacked by the mob. Hodges recalls struggling to breathe as the insurrectionists hit him in the head with a metal object, knocking him down before proceeding to hit him from all sides. He was then wedged into the doorway, bleeding from the mouth and blinded by his mask being held up over his eyes.\nHodges’s experience, Swalwell said, reminded him of what many other officers went through on Jan. 6, as well as of the three officers who lost their lives.\n“On January 6th, President Trump left everyone in this Capitol for dead,” Castro said.\nTrump’s refusal to condemn the violence, impeachment managers argued, aided in the rioters’ determination to continue the assault.\n“President Trump once again failed us,” Rep. Joe Neguse, D-Colorado, said. “He could have immediately and forcefully intervened and stopped the violencehe alone had that power.”\nVideo footage was just one part of the multimedia presentation that the House impeachment managers used to argue that Trump incited the attack on the Capitol.\n“The evidence will show you that President Trump is no innocent bystander,” Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Kensington, said as he opened the day’s proceedings. The lead House manager for the unprecedented trial, Raskin was the first of many House managers who followed a similar strategy: using Trump’s own words as key evidence.\nRaskin highlighted three of Trump’s tweets: a Dec. 12 message saying “WE HAVE JUST BEGUN TO FIGHT”; another on Dec. 12 alerting followers of a protest on Jan. 6, saying “Be there, will be wild!”; and one from that fateful day, Jan. 6, telling his supporters “And if you don’t fight like hell, you’re not going to have a country anymore.”\nOn Tuesday, Raskin revealed his own personal experiences of the Capitol riot. Raskin brought his daughter and son-in-law to work with him that day, so they could be together in their grief after losing his son, Tommy, just a few days earlier. Instead of observing a peaceful transfer of power, Raskin’s family ended up trapped, hiding in an office just off the House floor.\nRaskin’s trauma was mirrored by his fellow House managers, all of whom said they were grateful to have been able to walk back into the chambers after the Capitol had been secured, adding a raw and emotional element to the trial. Most of the senators, acting as the jury, went through similar experiences, which the House Democrats sought to remind them of during their presentations. Some senators even saw themselves fleeing danger in the new videos.\nNeguse and other House managers presented evidence to support the contention that the attack on the Capitol was not an isolated incident. Instead, they said, it was incited by Trump’s continuous insistence that if he were to lose the 2020 election, it would be as a result of a rigged election.\nVideo compilations showed Trump at rallies across the country before the November election, claiming that the Democratic Party was trying to steal the election. On election night, Trump went so far as to say that he had already won the election — a statement Trump has never withdrawn.\nPost-election, Trump disputed the results of the election, first turning to the courts. After over 60 courts said his lawsuits were without merit, Trump did not end the “stolen election” narrative.\nThe Trump campaign released advertisements calling the election fraudulent, reportedly spending millions of dollars on them and scheduling them to run up until Jan. 5.\n“They use the same words and phrases Trump had been using for months,” Swalwell said.\nDuring this time, Trump’s direct line of communication with his supporters was through social media. Alongside his own posts, his supporters took to their own platforms to assert his claims and aid in the planning of events. The House managers said Trump’s team actively monitored the sites in which his self-proclaimed “cavalry” made plans for Jan. 6.\n“Truth is truth, whether it is denied or not,” Plaskett said, presenting evidence that Trump’s team was aware of the role he played in his supporters’ plans.\n“And the truth is,” she said, “President Trump has spent months calling his supporters to a march on a specific day, at a specific time, in specific places, to stop the certification in leading up to the event. There were hundreds of posts online showing his supporters took this as a call to arms.”\nRep. Madeleine Dean, D-Pennsylvania, delivered a harrowing timeline of the day’s events, her voice sometimes cracking with emotion.\nAt noon, Trump started his so-called “Save America” speech, in which he repeated that he would not concede the election and called his supporters to march to the Capitol. In this speech alone, he said the word “fight” 20 times, according to Dean.\nAt 12:30 p.m., segments of the rally crowd began to march to the Capitol. At 12:53 p.m., the northwest barricade of the Capitol was breached while Capitol Police struggled to force the violent throng back to the steps. By 1:45 p.m., the mob was able to surge past the officers. Shouts of “This is a revolution!” could be heard from the crowd.\nJust after 2:10 p.m., insurrectionist mobs overwhelmed security and entered the halls of the Capitol. By 2:30 p.m., Dean said she could hear the “terrifying” banging on the House chamber doors  a sound that she said she would never be able to forget.\nRep. David Cicilline, D- Rhode Island, and Castro detailed Trump’s actions after his speech and as the assault proceeded. At no time did the president try to halt the deadly attack, they said.\nAfter sending his supporters to the Capitol, Trump was silent until 1:49 p.m., when he tweeted a video using footage from his speech that day about “stopping the steal” of the election. \n“He could have commanded those to leave, but he didn’t,” Cicilline said.\nInstead, Cicilline said, Trump’s sole focus was on ensuring that the electoral votes were not certified. And, despite tweets that he wanted things to remain peaceful, Trump did not call on the National Guard to help the outnumbered Capitol and Metro police forces. It was Pence, Castro said, that reportedly made the call while still under threat.\nThe last thing Trump said in a tweet on Jan. 6, at 6:01 p.m., was: “These are the things and events that happen when a sacred landslide election victory is so unceremonious  viciously stripped away from great patriots…”\n“Donald Trump abdicated his duty to us all,” Cicilline said. “We have to make this right. And you can make it right.”\nThe trial continues Thursday at noon."

    "title": "On bipartisan vote, Senate declares Trump trial constitutional; arguments start Wednesday",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  On a bipartisan vote of 56-44, the U.S. Senate Tuesday asserted the constitutionality of its right to try former President Donald Trump for inciting the deadly Jan. 6 insurrection at the United States Capitol.\nThe vote cleared the way for an historic and unprecedented trial starting Wednesday, scheduled to unfold over the coming days amidst raw emotions and sharp political divisions among Democrats and Republicans.\nAfter opening the proceedings with a 13-minute-long video compilation of the Jan. 6 assault that left five dead, the lead House manager, Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Kensington, told the senators: “If that’s not an impeachable offense, then there’s no such thing.”\nSens. Bill Cassidy, R-Louisiana, Susan Collins, R-Maine, Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, Mitt Romney, R-Utah, Ben Sasse, R-Nebraska, and Patrick Toomey, R-Pennsylvania, all voted in line with Democrats on the constitutionality question. But Democrats would need an additional 11 Republican senators to secure a conviction on the one article of impeachment charging Trump with incitement.\nTwo of Trump’s new lawyers, Bruce L. Castor Jr. and David Schoen, insisted a Senate trial was constitutionally out of bounds and charged that Democrats were chiefly interested in removing their client as a viable presidential candidate in 2024.\n“Let’s understand why we’re really here,” Castor said. “We’re really here because the majority of the House of Representatives does not want to face Donald Trump as a political candidate in the future.”\nRaskin argued that allowing former President Trump’s actions to go unpunished would create a dangerous new “January exception to the Constitution of the United States.”\nThe video Raskin showed included footage from the Senate floor, videos posted online by the rioters, and clips of Trump’s address at the rally of his supporters shortly before and during the attack, mounted as the electoral college votes were about to be formally counted in a joint session of Congress.\nRaskin later gave a riveting account of the personal pain that he experienced on that day — the fear of losing his daughter and son-in-law, compounded with the recent loss of his son. After reuniting with them following the chaos in the halls, Raskin said he tried to reassure his daughter Tabitha that she would not face such danger when she returned to the Capitol. He choked back tears as he recalled her reply: “Dad, I don’t want to come back to the Capitol.”\n“Of all the terrible brutal things I saw and heard on that day and since then, that one hit me the hardest,” the Maryland lawmaker said.\n“Senators, this cannot be our future,” Raskin said. “This cannot be the future of America. We cannot have presidents inciting and mobilizing mob violence against our government and our institutions because they refuse to accept the will of the people under the Constitution of the United States.”\nFellow House manager Rep. Joe Neguse, D-Colorado, called the insurrection the “Framers’ worst nightmare come to life.” Citing legal precedents from throughout American history, Neguse argued that it was indeed constitutional for the Senate to try the president after he already has left office.\nNeguse pointed out the importance of the British impeachment case in the 1780s and 1790s against Warren Hastings, which was started two years after he held the position of governor-general of Bengal. The case was cited by George Mason during the writing of the Constitution’s clauses about impeachment.\nNeguse also cited the impeachment of William Belknap, President Ulysses Grant’s secretary of war, arguing that not only did the Senate impeach Belknap after he had resigned, but they also spent two weeks debating the constitutionality of the issue, eventually concluding that the Senate did have the right to impeach a person who no longer held office.\nRep. David Cicilline, D-Rhode Island, another House manager, said that “moving on” and dismissing the impeachment case was “wrong.”\nHe added that Trump had “sided with the insurrectionists” and “validated their attack.”\n“He told them, ‘remember this day forever,’” Cicilline said. “Hours after, they marched through these halls looking to assassinate Vice President (Mike) Pence, the speaker of the House, and any of us they could find.”\n“I really do not believe that our attention span is so short, our sense of duty so frail, our factional loyalty so all-consuming, that a president can provoke an attack on Congress itself and get away with it, just because it occurred near the end of his term,” Cicilline said.\nIn a 50-minute-long defense that appeared to be delivered informally, Castor argued that the House Democrats had denied Trump due process. He also contended that the Constitution does not permit the impeachment of a president who is no longer in office because the process is specifically designed to remove an individual from office  a moot point in Trump’s case.\nCastor accused Democrats of taking the easy way out and of belittling the judgment of the American public.\n“The American people just spoke and just changed administrations,” Castor said.\nHe argued that impeachment has now become a common process, noting how rare it was before then-President Bill Clinton’s impeachment and trial in late 1998 and early 1999.\n“This is supposed to be the ultimate safety valve, the last thing that happens, the most rare treatment….so the slippery slope principle will have taken hold if we continue forward,” Castor said.\nHe warned that the trial could backfire on Democrats, who face midterm elections next year that could threaten their control of Congress.\nSchoen said Trump was the victim of “the insatiable lust for impeachment in the House for the past four years.”\nSchoen illustrated his point by showing a montage of Democratic lawmakers calling for Trump’s impeachment over the course of his presidency.\nThe video included clips of Raskin as well as Reps. Maxine Waters, D-California, Al Green, D-Texas,  Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-New York, Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Michigan, and Ilhan Omar, D-Minnesota.\nSchoen then sought to counter the House managers’ argument that Trump’s conviction is needed to bring the country together after the insurrection.\nThey say you need this trial before the nation can heal, that the nation cannot heal without it,” Schoen said. “I say, our nation cannot possibly heal with it.”\nHe argued that the trial will “open up new and bigger wounds across the nation,” with many in the country viewing it as “a chance by a group of partisan politicians, seeking to eliminate Donald Trump from the American political scene and seeking to disenfranchise 74 million-plus American voters, and those who dare to share their political beliefs and vision of America.”\nSchoen added that the Democrats “hated the results of the 2016 election and want to use this impeachment process to further their political agenda.”\nThe trial is expected to last into the weekend and next week."

    "title": "Joe Biden takes oath as 46th president, declares &#8216;democracy has prevailed&#8217;",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  Joseph R. Biden Jr. was sworn into office Wednesday as the 46th president of the United States, calling for national unity amidst a pandemic and increased racial tension, violence and political polarization.\n“I will be a president for all Americans,” Biden said in his inaugural address, repeating a sentiment he tweeted the day he was projected to win the presidency. “I will fight as hard for those who didn’t vote for me as for those who did.”\nThe theme of the inauguration was “America United, a concept highlighted throughout the Biden-Harris campaign. In his address, Biden emphasized the importance of unity, saying: “Today on this January day, my whole soul is in this, bringing America together, uniting our people, uniting our nation and I ask every American to join me in this cause.”\n“This is our historic moment of crisis and challenge, and unity is the path forward. And we must meet this moment as the United States of America,” Biden said. “If we do that, I guarantee you, we will not fail. We have never, ever, ever, ever failed in America when weve acted together.”\nJust two weeks after a deadly insurrection, Biden stood on a specially-built platform on the West Front of the United States Capitol, just as every president since Ronald Reagan did before him, and called for an end to the “uncivil war.”  He pledged to lead the country into a “story of hope,” in which a “riotous mob” does not mean an end to democracy and liberty.\n“Democracy has prevailed,” Biden said.\nChief Justice John Roberts swore Biden in as president, while Dr. Jill Biden held for her husband a Bible that has been in the family for 127 years. The five-inch-thick Bible contains important dates in the family’s history, including the dates Biden was sworn into the Senate starting in 1972 and as the nation’s 47th vice president in 2009,\nVice President Kamala Harris, the first woman, the first Black person and the first Indian American person to hold the office, was sworn in by Supreme Court Associate Justice Sonia Sotomayor, a meeting of one history-making woman with another, as Sotomayor was the first Latina to serve on the high court.\nBiden began his day at the Cathedral of St. Matthew the Apostle, not far from the White House, for a pre-inaugural Mass, alongside Harris and members of both of their families.\n\nAttendees also included House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, who all later joined Biden again at the inaugural ceremony. (By late afternoon, Schumer became Senate majority leader because Harris gives the Democrats a 51-50 edge in votes in that chamber.)\n\nBiden chose St. Matthew’s for the service because it is where John F. Kennedy’s funeral was held. Kennedy was the nation’s only other Catholic president.\nThe inauguration included a variety of performances.\nLady Gaga, wearing a billowing, patriotic red and navy dress adorned with a golden dove, sang the national anthem. She pointed emphatically to an American flag flying from the Capitol when she sang “and our flag was still there.”\nJennifer Lopez performed a high-energy rendition of “This Land is Your Land” and “America the Beautiful.” She recited a line of the pledge of allegiance in Spanish — Una nación, bajo Dios, indivisible, con libertad y justicia para todos — and sang “Let’s Get Loud,” a nod to one of her songs.\n\n\nCountry superstar Garth Brooks followed with a performance of “Amazing Grace.” Brooks has performed for every president since Jimmy Carter, except for Reagan and Donald Trump.\nBiden also tapped 2017 National Youth Poet Laureate Amanda Gorman to recite her own work at the ceremony. The 22-year-old is the youngest poet in recent history to read at an inauguration. Her poem, “The Hill We Climb,” echoed Biden’s hopes for the nation.\n“And yes, we are far from polished, far from pristine, but that doesn’t mean we are striving to form a union that is perfect,” Gorman said. “We are striving to forge our union with purpose, to compose a country committed to all cultures, colors, characters and conditions of man.”\nIn place of thousands of people normally congregating to watch the inauguration, the National Mall was filled by an art installation from the Presidential Inaugural Committee entitled “Field of Flags.”\nThe installation included almost 200,000 flags, including state and territorial flags, as well as 56 pillars of light. The installation symbolized all the Americans that could not travel to the Washington area due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic and heightened security surrounding the inauguration.\nAmid some light snow flurries followed by sunshine, the masked audience of about 2,000 watched the inauguration from a small group of socially distanced chairs. In past years, members of Congress have received about 200,000 tickets to distribute to their constituents. This year, they were limited to tickets for themselves and one guest. Tickets for the media also were limited.\nBiden’s first day in office came just days after the country reached a grim milestone of over 400,000 COVID-19 deaths.\nWith the siege on the Capitol and the inauguration, Washington’s security was tightened more than at any time in recent memory.\nThe National Park Service closed the National Mall and several surrounding streets from January 15 to the day after the inauguration. About 25,000 National Guard members were stationed in the Washington area for the inauguration and other related ceremonies, CNN reported.\nThe inauguration continued unhindered by security concerns: a bomb threat was called into the Supreme Court, but the building was not evacuated. Two people were arrested near the Washington Monument by federal officers for having illegal weapons at a security checkpoint.\nAs he looked over members of both the Democratic and Republican Parties in attendance at the inauguration, Biden called for bipartisanship.\n“Politics doesn’t have to be a raging fire, destroying everything in its path,” Biden said. “Every disagreement doesn’t have to be a cause for total war.”\nSeveral members of the Biden and Harris families attended the ceremony, along with former presidents and first ladies Bill and Hillary Clinton, George W. and Laura Bush and Barack and Michelle Obama.\nFormer Vice President Mike Pence and former second lady Karen Pence also attended the inauguration.\nFormer President Jimmy Carter, the oldest living president at 96 years old, was not in attendance, marking his first missed inauguration in 44 years.  A spokesperson for the Carter Center said that Mr. Carter and his wife “have sent their best wishes to President-elect Biden and Vice President-elect (Kamala) Harris and look forward to a successful administration.”\nTrump was notably missing from the day’s events. He delivered final remarks as president at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland, telling a modest crowd of his family and supporters that they “will be back in some form,” and then departing from the Washington area as president one final time On Air Force One to Palm Beach, Florida.\nTrump had ignored the traditions of presidential transitions, not only refusing to concede the election to Biden but also never meeting with him. Trump left town rather than endure the usual custom of an outgoing president meeting his successor at the White House for morning refreshments, accompanying the new president to the Capitol and attending the oath-taking.\nBiden was not mentioned in Trump’s final remarks and Trump was not mentioned in Biden’s inaugural address. While nearly all traditions of the peaceful transfer of power went unobserved this year, departing White House spokesman Judd Deere confirmed that Trump left a note for Biden, as did Pence for Harris.\nSome Maryland leaders were in attendance at the inauguration.\nGov. Larry Hogan, a Republican, released a statement saying he was honored to attend the inauguration on behalf of the Maryland people.\nHogan congratulated Biden and pledged “the same spirit of partnership, honesty, and goodwill” that Hogan offered to former presidents Trump and Obama.\nMaryland Sen. Chris Van Hollen, a Democrat, echoed Biden’s sentiments on unity in a statement released after the inauguration: “Together, we must work to heal our country, stride boldly into the future, and pursue a more perfect, just, and equal union.”\nHouse Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland also released a statement: “No one is so naive to think that our deep divisions will now yield to full cooperation and consensus, but I am hopeful that the tone our new President has set will make the next four years a time of healing and reunification after such a period of conflict, crisis, and confrontation.”\nBefore participating in a short parade to the White House along empty streets, Biden and Harris were joined by the former first couples  the Clintons, Bushes and Obamas  at a wreath-laying ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery, just across the Potomac River in northern Virginia.\nLater Wednesday, Biden issued 17 executive orders and Harris swore in her Senate replacement, Alex Padilla, as well as new Georgia Democratic Sens. Rev. Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff."

    "title": "Trump impeached for inciting Capitol assault, faces uncertain Senate verdict",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  With just seven days remaining in his term, President Donald Trump on Wednesday became the first U.S. president to be impeached twice.\nThe House of Representatives voted 232-197 to impeach the president for “inciting an insurrection against the government of the United States.”\n“He must go  he is a clear and present danger to the nation that we all love,” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-California, said as she opened the House floor debate over the single article of impeachment.\nIn a break with the president, 10 Republicans voted with the 222 Democrats to support the article of impeachment. Most announced ahead of time how they would vote. Earlier this week, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-California, said he would not whip members into voting against impeachment.\nThe impeachment article will move to the Senate for a trial. But Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, has said he will not reconvene the Senate prior to the middle of next week, meaning the trial would occur during the opening days of President-elect Joe Biden’s administration.\nBased on Senate procedures and precedents, McConnell said in a statement late Wednesday, “there is simply no chance that a fair or serious trial could conclude before President-elect Biden is sworn in next week.”\n“The Senate has held three presidential impeachment trials,” he added. “They have lasted 83 days, 37 days and 21 days, respectively. Even if the Senate process were to begin this week and move promptly, no final verdict would be reached until after President Trump had left office. This is not a decision I am making; it is a fact.”\nOn a day that started with photographs of National Guard members sleeping in the halls of the United States Capitol Visitor Center, an emotional House debated the president’s role in last week’s violence, which followed Trumps’ remarks at a rally repeating baseless claims that the election was stolen from him and encouraging attendees to “show strength” as they walked to the Capitol.\nThe National Guard is expected to maintain a significant presence in the nation’s capital ahead of inauguration celebrations and potential further protests next week.\nDemocrats will gain control of the Senate later this month. Biden is reportedly seeking a method to split the Senate’s time between an impeachment trial and other agenda items, including a package of COVID relief.\nA New York Times report on Tuesday said McConnell is “pleased” by impeachment and its potential effects on the Republican Party’s ability to distance itself from the president.\nOn Wednesday McConnell sent a letter to Senate colleagues saying he had not yet decided how to vote in an impeachment trial but would “listen to the legal arguments when they are presented to the Senate.” That is markedly different from the Republican leader’s stance during last year’s impeachment trial of Trump, when McConnell opposed it from the start.\nIn her floor speech, Pelosi retraced Trump’s lies about voter fraud since the election in November and connected them to the Jan. 6 storming of the Capitol by an insurrectionist mob, which led to the immediate deaths of five people, including a United States Capitol Police officer.\nPelosi said the president must be impeached for his role in motivating the rioters.\n“They did not appear out of a vacuum. They were sent here by the president with words such as a cry to ‘fight like hell,’” Pelosi said. “Words matter. Truth matters. Accountability matters.”\nPelosi responded to calls for unity from Republicans by urging adherence to the facts.\n“Our country is divided. We all know that. There are lies abroad in the land spread by a desperate president who feels his power slipping away,” Pelosi said. “I know this as well: that we here in this house have a sacred obligation to stand for the truth.”\nThe debate was closed by House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Maryland, who drew a contrast between the ideals of Abraham Lincoln and those of the current president.\n“His desire for autocracy and his glorification of violence have not been tempered, but rationalized  rationalized by those who sought to profit financially and politically from their proximity to power,” Hoyer said of Trump.\nHoyer commended Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyoming, and the third-ranking member of GOP leadership, for her support for impeachment. He quoted extensively from a statement Cheney released Tuesday which read, in part: “The president of the United States summoned this mob, assembled the mob, and lit the flame of this attack.”\nRep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, led the Republican opposition to impeachment. He and other Republicans drew false equivalency between the riot at the Capitol and Black Lives Matter protests last summer.\n“Republicans have been consistent,” Jordan said. “We’ve condemned all the violence all the time.”\nJordan also portrayed the impeachment debate as part of an ongoing effort to remove the president that began in the first days of Trump’s term. He also dubbed the proceedings part of “cancel culture.”\n“If it continues it won’t just be Republicans who get canceled. It won’t just be the president of the United States,” Jordan said. “The cancel culture will come for us all.”\nRepublicans speaking in opposition to impeachment drew a contrast with previous impeachments, which included longer investigations and committee hearings.\n“I cannot think of a more petty, vindictive and gratuitous act than to impeach an already defeated president a week before he is to leave office,” said Rep. Tom McClintock, R-California.\nBut Rep. Dan Newhouse of Washington scolded his fellow GOP colleagues and later, with nine other Republicans, voted with the majority for impeachment.\n“Others including myself are responsible for not speaking out sooner, before the president misinformed and inflamed a violent mob,” he said.\nIn response to Republican requests for a broader investigation, Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-California, pointed to the public nature of the president’s remarks at the rally proceeding the violent insurrection last week.\n“Today, we don’t need a long investigation to know the president incited right-wing terrorists to attack the Congress, to try to overturn constitutional government,” Lofgren said. “The actions were in public, plain as day.”\nWhile Republicans sought to distance insurrectionists from the mainstream of their party, Democrats attempted to connect the riot to what they said was long-standing rhetoric from the president.\nRep. Jerry Nadler, D-New York, highlighted the white supremacist elements of the Capitol attack, which included the display of the Confederate battle flag.\n“We have a duty to observe… that racism played a direct role in this incitement,” Nadler said. “The president’s violent rhetoric is always at its most fevered pitch when he’s talking about the civil rights and civic aspirations of Black Americans and other minority communities.”\nNadler’s remarks came after new details emerged from Democratic Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts about their experiences during last week’s riot.\nOcasio-Cortez said during an Instragram Live Tuesday she “had a very close encounter where I thought I was going to die.”\nPressley’s chief of staff, Sarah Groh, told the Boston Globe that she tried last week to use the panic buttons installed in Pressley’s office to summon help, but found they had been torn out.\nSeveral Democratic House members pointed to their traumatic experiences, telling their stories of hiding in the gallery of the House chamber.\nRep. Steve Cohen, D-Tennessee, said he fears for the next week in Washington, pointing to reports that more violence is planned in support of the president.\n“Intelligence reports indicate that the people (Trump) said he loves and are special are going to attack this city and attack this Capitol next week,” Cohen said.\nTrump responded to those reports Wednesday ahead of the impeachment vote. In a statement, he said: “I urge that there must be NO violence, NO lawbreaking and NO vandalism of any kind.”\n\n\nAfter the House vote, Trump released a video in which he said: All of us can choose by our actions to rise above the rancor, and find common ground and shared purpose.\nEarlier in the day, the House debated and then approved a rule for consideration of the impeachment resolution. No Republican members voted in favor of the rule, signaling early the party would mostly stand by the president.\nEarlier Wednesday, Rep. Jason Crow, D-Colorado, said in an MSNBC interview that some of his Republican colleagues wanted to vote in favor of impeachment.\n“A couple of them broke down in tears, saying that they are afraid for their lives if they vote for this impeachment,” Crow said.\nPolitico’s Tim Alberta reported that some members of Congress have received death threats this week and the threats may have affected votes on impeachment.\nCNN reported that Republicans were under “huge pressure” from the White House to oppose impeachment.\nDuring the rule debate ahead of the impeachment article, Hoyer emphasized the importance of Congress as a check on the executive branch.\n“There are consequences to actions, and the actions of the president of the United States demand urgent, clear action by the Congress of the United States,” he said.\nThe House on Tuesday approved a resolution calling on Vice President Mike Pence and the cabinet to use the 25th Amendment to remove Trump from office. Pence has said he will not implement the amendment."

    "title": "Maryland immigrants await Biden moves on immigration policy promises",
    "content": "Yoslin Amaya Hernandez, a Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipient, is hesitant to celebrate President-elect Joe Biden’s victory just yet. She says she is uncertain whether he will live up to the promises he’s made on immigration policy.\nBiden campaigned to reverse policies enacted under President Donald Trump’s administration. Now, with only a little over a month to the inauguration, Amaya Hernandez and many of the nearly 1 million immigrants like her in Maryland, along with supporters and critics, await the new administration to see whether substantial policy changes will be delivered.\n“Were a very vulnerable community,” Amaya Hernandez, 23, of Montgomery County, Maryland, said. “If he is promising things for the community and these things dont happenwere back to the uncertainty.”\nWhen Amaya Hernandez was eight years old, she and her mother and younger sister left El Salvador and crossed the Mexican border to enter the United States. They were caught and an immigration case was opened. In 2007, a judge ordered a voluntary departure, but the family stayed, so they were ordered deported.\nDACA allowed Amaya Hernandez and thousands of other undocumented youths to remain in the country and work for temporary renewal periods.\nDue to the program, Amaya Hernandez has been able to enroll at the University of Maryland — where she is currently a senior majoring in government and politics — and take on several jobs, often at once, to provide for her two kids, ages 3 and 5.\nWhile she is applying for permanent residency because her husband is a U.S. citizen, she fears being deported before obtaining legal status and potentially being prohibited from re-entering the country for 10 years.\n“At any given moment, I could be gone,” she said. “My kids have to stay here and they have to be without their mother for who knows how long.”\nHer life and those of many people in Maryland without permanent legal status remains in limbo.\nMaryland has about 275,000 undocumented immigrants, who as of 2018 made up nearly 30% of the state’s large immigrant population, according to the American Immigration Council.\nUndocumented immigration has been strictly scrutinized by the Trump administration, which included terminating DACA on Sept. 5, 2017 — the very day Amaya Hernandez’s sister turned 15 and would have been eligible to apply but could no longer do so.\nWhile Biden has promised to reinstate DACA, a Dec. 4 court ruling ordered the Department of Homeland Security to begin accepting new DACA applications and restore the two-year renewal period that the current administration shortened to just one year.\nBiden, meanwhile, also has committed to revising “temporary protected status” (TPS) designations, which prevents people from being returned to certain countries deemed unsafe.\nOn Sept. 14, the Trump administration terminated TPS designations. Recently, they were extended for some citizens of El Salvador, Haiti, Nicaragua, Sudan, Honduras and Nepal until at least October 2021.\nBiden has also committed to revamping deportation, detention and enforcement policies. Proposed changes include creation of a task force to find parents of 545 migrant children who were separated at the border, a 100-day freeze on deportations and the reversal of the Migrant Protection Protocols, under which families with children are sent to Mexico to await their U.S. asylum cases.\n“The Biden transition team has already kind of signaled that they want to immediately roll back many of the stringent asylum policies that the Trump administration put in through executive order,” said Mike Amezcua, assistant professor of history at Georgetown University.\n“Theres a lot of a lot of promises being made right now. And hopefully, Biden will deliver on many of them,” he added.\nJessica Vaughan, director of policy studies at the Center of Immigration Studies, a think tank that advocates lower immigration rates, believes rolling back asylum and deportation policies will lead to conflict within the Biden administration and a potential border crisis.\n“The president-elect has made no secret of his interest in enacting a massive amnesty for almost everyone who’s now in the country illegally,” she continued. “The perception around the world is that Biden is going to loosen the rules so they might as well start coming down.”\nBiden has also made promises to legal immigrants, which includes increasing the overall number of temporary, work-based visas — a move that would impact immigrants from, among other places, India, China and the Philippines, who make up a large portion of Maryland’s immigrants.\nIn June, the Trump administration halted the issuance of work-based visas and green cards until the end of the year.\nAccording to the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), citizens from India receive almost 75% of H1-B visas despite being just 6% of the state’s immigrants, according to data from the American Immigration Council. The visa is issued to highly-skilled workers in “speciality occupations,” such as those in the tech industry, and is the most popular of 22 work-based visas.\nChinese workers — 5% of the state’s immigrants — receive nearly 12% of H1-B visa, while Filipinos  4% of Maryland immigrants  get under 1%.\n“We need to bring in the talent, we should have the ability to bring the talent, not to replace Americans but to supplement us or to give us the brain power that is needed to stay ahead of countries like China and others coming faster and harder,” said Sanjay Puri, chairman at the U.S. India Political Action Committee, a bipartisan organization representing Indian-Americans.\nBiden has promised to repeal Trump’s travel ban — one of Trumps first controversial immigration moves in 2017 that was extended early this year. The ban particularly affects Nigerian immigrants in Maryland, the state’s fourth-largest immigrant group.\nThe travel ban barred visas to citizens of predominantly-Muslim and African countries, including Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria, Yemen, Venezuela and North Korea. Residents of Nigeria, Myanmar, Eritrea, Kyrgyzstan, Sudan and Tanzania were only allowed visitor visas to prevent them from settling permanently in the United States.\nIn a symbolic signal of planned policy shifts, Biden nominated Alejandro Mayorkas as head of the Department of Homeland Security. If confirmed, Mayorkas would be the first immigrant to lead the agency.\nYet Georgetown’s Amezcua is unsure if this pick sends the best message to immigrants.\n“In the appointment of Mayorkas, there is really a feeling that Biden and the Biden team right now is not really meeting the moment when they appoint somebody with what I would argue is kind of like a tarnished record,” he said.\nMayorkas served as deputy secretary of homeland security and director of USCIS under President Barack Obama, who enacted the DACA program but was also dubbed “deporter-in-chief” by critics because removals increased significantly in comparison to previous administrations (although apprehensions and overall deportations decreased).\nBut Puri views Mayorkas’s background and experience as positives.\n“DHS is a huge, huge part of our government, a huge bureaucracy. We need somebody whos got really hands-on experience,” he said.\nPuri also sees immigration reform as crucial, even if it remains a controversial and complex issue.\n“If we can have a comprehensive reform, its really going to be good for the country,” Puri said. “Its going to be healing, bringing out the people who are in the shadows, because everybody knows they are here and a key part of our country.”"

    "title": "For area libraries and patrons, pandemic has meant a whole new story",
    "content": "WASHINGTON — When the COVID-19 pandemic emerged — but before everything truly shut down — Elyse Kovalsky’s first stop was the Mt. Pleasant Library on 16th Street in Northwest Washington.\n“When everyone else was freaking out and going to buy toilet paper, I freaked out and went to the library,” said Kovalsky, 39, an employee at a non-profit in the city.\n“I got as many books as I could physically carry, and I remember walking home and they, at some point on 19th Street, all fell out of my hands,” she said. But at that moment, going to the library “felt like the most important thing.\nSince the closure of many businesses and operations in March, many libraries in both the District of Columbia and Maryland have reopened and are now running at limited capacity. The revamped operations have introduced significant challenges and opportunities for libraries and their patrons.\nMaryland Library Association President Morgan Miller referred to libraries as “a really important touchstone” for many patrons.\nAccording to Pew Research Center survey data from 2016, more than half of respondents indicated that libraries helped them get information that helps with making decisions, grow as a person, learn new things and find information that is trustworthy and reliable.\nLibraries also provide crucial resources, such as educational materials, computer access and even shelter to their communities. In this way, Miller described libraries as acting as a form of “social safety net.”\nThe DC Public Library system shut down mid-March and entered Phase Two mid-summer. Of the 26 public libraries,18 are open and running on a limited basis, while eight remain closed.\nFor the libraries running on a limited basis, all in-person group programs, such as children’s storytelling sessions, have been put on hiatus. In addition, patrons cannot browse books inside the library, sit at a table or lounge area, copy or scan materials, or use the meeting or study rooms.\nDespite these restrictions, DC Public Library spokesman George Williams noted that patrons are still able to come in to pick up books that they have on hold, apply for library cards, send documents electronically for free printing, borrow from a curated selection of book titles available for checkout near the circulation desk, and use a computer — although the number of public computers available has decreased.\nIn the state of Maryland, there are 24 public library systems — one for each of Maryland’s 23 counties, as well as one for Baltimore City — and each is operating in accordance with its own reopening plan.\nLibraries in some counties, such as Cecil County, have recently begun to reopen some branches with limited capacity, social distancing and safety protocols.\nIn the library systems of counties where the state has consistently been reporting the highest COVID-19 caseloads, such as Prince George’s County and Montgomery County, all buildings remain closed to the public.\nMost branches in Prince George’s County Memorial Library System and Montgomery County Public Libraries have been offering appointment-based outdoor pickup for holds placed online or over the phone.\nLibraries are placing a greater emphasis on their virtual opportunities, which they say have flourished in the wake of the initial COVID-19 lockdown.\nBefore curbside services and limited reopenings, patrons were essentially limited to checking out electronic materials from online resources, such as the Overdrive digital content library, so electronic media have seen significantly more traction with patrons.\nFrom mid-March to mid-November, the DC Public Library saw a 34% increase in checkouts and a 81% increase in holds over the numbers from the same period last year on Overdrive, Williams said in an email.\nThe digital transition has also led many libraries across the District of Columbia and Maryland to transition previously in-person programs like book clubs and children’s storytelling sessions to online platforms such as Zoom and Discord.\nIn addition, Miller said that many libraries introduced new programming — often video sessions that teach viewers skills for managing daily life amid a pandemic, such as preparing restaurant-quality meals and promoting literacy in homebound children.\n“We saw this huge rapid rollout and proliferation of really high-quality virtual programming,” Miller said. “In some ways, while our physical spaces got smaller and much more constrained, we became much more expansive, and in these online worlds, we ended up connecting with people in the community who we never had before.”\nWhile these transitions to online programming may have seemed smooth for patrons, they required attention to detail for library staff — “program by program, need by need, figuring out how we want to do it,” said David Quick, the DC Public Librarys coordinator of adult programs and partnerships.\nMany libraries have gone “fine free,” either temporarily or permanently, to minimize barriers to community use.\nMontgomery County Public Libraries advertises on its website that its library fines are “currently suspended.”\nPrince George’s County Memorial Library System, meanwhile, committed to becoming “fine free” on July 1, noting in a press release its intent to ensure that “all Prince Georgians have equitable access to the Library’s resources and services, while eliminating the financial barrier of overdue fines.”\nAs for the District, more than 4,000 library cards were unblocked and more than 87,000 cards that had expired since April 2017 were restored, Williams said.\n“One of the things that the library has been doing for several years is, we have been systematically removing barriers,” he added.\nMany patrons have shown an increased interest in learning about anti-racism — particularly after Minneapolis police officers arrested and killed George Floyd on May 25 — and libraries have been striving to help.\nWilliams said that DC Public Library data shows the top titles between mid-March and early November were “White Fragility: Why Its So Hard for White People to Talk About Racism,” by Robin DiAngelo, and “So You Want to Talk about Race,” by Ijeoma Oluo.\nThe DC Public Library now offers unlimited eBook and audiobook copies of limited titles on race.\nSeeing a similar interest in Prince George’s County, the library system there partnered with local agencies and nonprofits to host a virtual event in July featuring “How to Be an Antiracist” author Dr. Ibram X. Kendi.\nThe event attracted more than 226,000 live views, according to the library’s COO for communication and outreach, Nicholas Brown.\nSome patrons also have taken more time to explore genres that are new to them.\nBefore COVID-19, Kovalsky said she would stop in at least once a month, pick up books, browse the shelves with her two kids, or attend the weekend activities. Now she makes monthly pickups, but her tastes have shifted. Kovalsky said she had not read a book for pleasure in years, but recently began reading “The Refugees,” a non-fiction book by Viet Thanh Nguyen.\nAriana Dugan, 33, vice president of product and enterprise at General Assembly, said she has been using the Mt. Pleasant Library more often since the beginning of the pandemic because “it’s a nice alternative to screen time for work.”\nDugan said she also enjoys newfound efficiency: “It’s a little bit more transactional, because I go online to sign the book, order it, and then just pick it up at the library rather than having that kind of browsing experience, and I don’t super mind that honestly.”\nShe has also discovered a love of non-fiction.\n“Things that take me out of the here-and-now but are still in one way or another grounded in reality, I would say is a common theme in terms of what I’ve been getting from the library,” she said.\nFor some people, despite the libraries’ enhanced cleaning protocols and changes, COVID-19 remains a concern.\nJulie Locascio, an attorney and long-time Washington resident, told Capital News Service that since the beginning of the pandemic she has only picked up one book from the library and has been very careful to minimize human exposure.\nDespite this, she wrote in a social media message to CNS, “I have been super grateful at how many books I have been able to borrow electronically from the library.”\nNot everybody knows the libraries are open.\nThe District library and city government have been providing updates through newsletters, government messages and notices.\nEven so, Kovalsky has come across several people who did not know the library was open during her walks to or from the library.\nThey would see her carrying books and ask her, “You’re going to the library? Why are you going to the library? How is that even open?!,” Kovalsky said.\nMiller said the pandemic-related closures may have made people realize that their libraries have much to offer.\n“People were never aware as we wanted or needed them to be about just how much value and service the library brings to the community,” Miller said. “Nobody thinks about it until it’s gone. I think not having a library as they know it brought to the forefront of their mind how much they miss it.”"

    "title": "Metro budget cuts would hurt workers and residents",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  Proposed budget cuts at Metro threaten thousands of jobs, the closure of 19 stations, the suspension of 19 bus lines and an end to weekend rail service.\n“We’re facing an historic budget crisis,” Metro General Manager and CEO Paul J. Wiedefeld said in a Nov. 30 online press briefing.\nWiedefeld’s proposed fiscal year 2022 budget cuts, which would take effect July 1, 2021, were released ahead of a Friday WMATA Board meeting. The moves are an attempt to overcome a $494 million operating deficit caused by a loss of riders during the coronavirus pandemic.\nBut the plan to slash service drew sharp attacks from a variety of critics.\nTara Maxwell, the political coordinator for Amalgamated Transit Union Local 689, said the cuts would be devastating for transit workers.\n“They don’t have any concern for the people that it’s affecting, or for their families,” Maxwell told Capital News Service.\nTransit advocates like Robert Puentes said the cuts would be devastating to the economy and transit network in the capital region.\n“It would have devastating effects on the city,” said Puentes, president and CEO of the Eno Center for Transportation, a non-profit research and policy foundation in Washington. Cuts of this magnitude, according to Puentes, will make it hard to retain riders and scale services back up after the pandemic.\nStewart Schwartz, the executive director of the Coalition for Smarter Growth, told CNS that the service cuts would hurt other essential workers who depend on buses and trains to get to work.\n“They’re the ones who would be most devastated by severe cuts to bus and rail service, the people who work in our grocery stores and hospitals, support city government services, public safety, healthcare, eldercare, childcare,” Scwartz said.\nMetro’s woes are mirrored by transit systems in other cities, like New York, where cuts to the MTA could mean thousands of job losses, and Los Angeles, where Metro authorities approved a $1.2 billion cut.\n“The pandemic has plunged the nation’s transit agencies into a profound crisis,” the National Association of City Transportation Officials says on its website.\n“Strong federal support is essential for providing essential services, including transit, throughout this crisis and in its aftermath,” the group says. “Without at least $32 billion in additional emergency aid for transit, our cities and economy cannot fully recover.”\nThe American Public Transit Association, an international association of public transit groups, called on Congress to pass tens of billions of dollars of emergency funding. APTA cited a poll from First View that found more than three-quarters of American voters supported emergency funds for public transit.\n“Americans not only want actions now to save public transit during the pandemic, but they want continued long-term actions that preserve and expand public transit services,” APTA CEO Paul Skoutelas said in a Nov. 19 statement.\nAccording to Schwartz, the loss of jobs and transit opportunities could drive parts of the Washington area workforce elsewhere, while leading to heavier car traffic and more severe greenhouse gas emissions, as more workers and tourists are forced to drive.\nMaxwell said job losses will also impact Black workers, noting that most of Local 689 members are Black. Job losses will hurt Maryland as well as the District of Columbia, as more than 7,000 members of Local 689 live in Prince George’s County, he said.\nTransit advocates agree with WMATA that the monetary problems caused by the pandemic are stark.\n“The cuts reflect the reality that the agency is in,” Puentes said.\nHouse Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Mechanicsville, said the fate of WMATA’s workers and services depends on Senate action.\n“The House passed two major pieces of legislation that would provide WMATA with desperately needed funding to avoid these drastic measures, yet the Senate has refused to act,” Hoyer said in a statement Tuesday.\nSchwartz echoed the sentiment, and said that Republicans and Democrats in Congress needed to intervene to save transit authorities, whose CARES Act funding has run out.\n“We can’t believe that it’s gotten to this point and Congress is still dithering,” Schwartz said.\nAbsent congressional action, both Maxwell and Schwartz think there are things local authorities, particularly Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan’s administration, can do to soften the blow.\n“We cannot and could never afford boondoggles like the maglev proposal, and hyper loops and new toll lanes,” Schwartz said. “We must put our existing transit systems first.”\nMaxwell questioned the utility of such projects at a time when thousands of workers in existing transit services face unemployment.\n“But even if I was a millionaire, why would I want to pay $50 per person for a toll,” Maxwell said.\n“Theyre spending millions of dollars right now on research and information that theyre finding out is not favorable toward the maglev you know, but they are still spending that money. That money could go to operational need for transit,” Maxwell said.\nHe added that transit operators have worked through the pandemic, despite the risk of exposure to coronavirus.\n“They stood in the gap. They transport other essential workers to and from work and home, Maxwell said. They did their part, but it doesn’t seem to be enough.”\nSchwartz said services would take a long time to recover.\n“It would mean a declining economy, greater unemployment, greater inequity, in terms of ability to gain access to jobs, a traffic Armageddon, setting back the D.C. region decades,” Schwartz said."

    "title": "The integration of sports and politics went to the next level in 2020",
    "content": "When Dodger Stadium underwent a redesign under the watchful eye of Janet Marie Smith in 2012, she never thought that nearly a decade later the stadium would be used as a polling center in a presidential election amidst a worldwide pandemic. \n“It was natural to look at larger venues,” said Smith, who is the Dodgers’ senior vice president of planning and development. “Thank goodness that those stadiums fall into those categories because there is plenty of space.”\nDodger Stadium, which had food trucks open and mariachi bands playing for voters, has also been used as a COVID-19 testing site and a food distribution center. \nNot only was it an unprecedented show of voter support and civic engagement when the Dodgers and other professional sports franchises opened their doors to become official voting centers, but also, experts say, they likely contributed to the record-breaking vote totals that are piling up ahead of President-elect Joe Biden’s assumption of office on Jan. 20.\nLOS ANGELES  The Dodger Stadium Vote Center on Friday, Oct. 30, 2020. (Photo courtesy of the Los Angeles Dodgers)\nIn total, 47 different franchises across the MLB, NFL, NBA, NHL and MLS opened their stadiums, arenas and fields to voters, according to a tally by Sports Illustrated. Unlike the Dodgers, not all of the franchises included entertainment and food for voters.\nBut thousands came anyway, boosting turnout.\nIn 2016, randomized voting trials showed that music and entertainment venues used for balloting increased voter turnout by three to four percentage points, Donald Green, professor of American politics at Columbia University, told Capital News Service. Green founded the experimental research section of the American Political Science Association and served as its first president.\nNearly 300,000 voters cast their ballots at sports venue polling centers this election, according to data compiled by USA Today. And that made a major difference in voter safety in major cities.      \nThe Dodgers were the first team in the MLB to open its stadium as a polling center in conjunction with an initiative by More Than a Vote, a group of Black athletes and artists that includes current and former Los Angeles sports greats such as the Lakers’ LeBron James and former WNBA star and Olympic gold medal-winner Lisa Leslie.\nMore Than a Vote partnered with other teams from around the major professional sports leagues in an attempt to reduce voter suppression in major cities. \n“In counties where Black people are the majority, death rates are 3.5 times higher than the national average. Our voting locations must offer safe, socially distanced voting,” More Than a Vote said in an open letter to the public in August. “If we don’t address this now, no joke, many Black people will be forced to put their health at risk just to cast a ballot.” \nFor the Dodgers, the partnership was seamless and a major success. \n“I think its consistent with our goals here in Los Angeles,” Smith said. “We want to feel like we are part of a greater community and that the things that we do are about more than just hosting baseball.”\nSmith said that she felt that the voters in the nation’s most populous county enjoyed the novelty of being able to vote inside the stadium in a time when baseball had gone into a “bubble” system to finish the season.\nLos Angeles County resident Art Mercado, 47, waited until Nov. 3, technically Election Day even though millions voted early, to vote inside of Dodger Stadium for the “bragging rights,” he told the Los Angeles Times. Among many other reasons voters chose to utilize the Dodger Stadium polling center, one voter said that he hoped that the Dodgers winning the World Series would bring him good luck. \n The Golden State Warriors opened three facilities across the San Francisco Bay Area for polling centers. \n“With our facilities in Oakland, San Francisco and Santa Cruz all being utilized to support the 2020 election process, this ranks as our most critical three-pointer of the year,” Warriors President and CEO Rick Welts said in a statement. “For our democracy to work, we all need to exercise our right to vote, and activating all three of these locations will help expand that opportunity for many Bay Area residents.”\nCalifornia Secretary of State Alex Padilla called the San Francisco 49ers decision to make Levi’s Stadium a polling center for the election a “touchdown for democracy.” \nThe Atlanta Hawks also opened their arena to voters in Fulton County, which turned out heavily in favor of Biden. The largest-ever voting center in Georgia allowed voters to safely cast their ballots both in the presidential and the August primary runoff elections. \nAlthough Smith said that she did not see Dodger Stadium being used in a similar manner in future elections, More Than a Vote pledged to continue its initiative focused on “systemic, targeted voter suppression in our community and will have a specific mission to: educate, energize and protect Black voters.”"

    "title": "Live music venues struggle to survive as the COVID-19 pandemic rages on",
    "content": "WASHINGTON — In the spring of 2010, Sandra Basanti and her husband, Stevie McKeever, opened up the Pie Shop, a small, live-music venue and restaurant located in this citys H Street corridor. \nAt first, they only sold pies, but soon after the launch, the couple began construction on their dream business, a live music venue, which opened in the summer of 2018. Opening the venue entailed putting down their life savings, “a masochistic amount of blood, sweat and tears,” taking out a “huge loan” and working insane hours, Basanti wrote in a pre-Thanksgiving social media post. \nThe effort was worth it. By October of last year, on most weeks, the calendar would be fully booked with four or five shows, which were an “eclectic mix of different types of artists and different types of art” representative of the citys diverse music scene, Basanti said.   \nThe live music was cut short this spring with the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic, which forced the Pie Shop and multiple other businesses in the District to temporarily close. \nToday, many music venues remain closed or are running at limited capacities, which can be a significant financial strain for musicians and business owners. At least three local music institutions have shuttered permanently: Twins Jazz, Eighteenth Street Lounge and most recently, U Street Music Hall. \n“Its such a weird year, and we literally have to just take everything month to month, its not an ideal position that were in right now financially,” Basanti, now known as the Pie Lady, told Capital News Service.  \nWASHINGTON  Stevie McKeever and Sandra Basanti, owners of Washingtons Pie Shop, in the spring of 2018. (Photo courtesy of Sandra Basanti)\nOn Sept. 25, Mayor Muriel Bowser announced the “Phase Two Live Entertainment Pilot,” which allowed six venues to host live entertainment through October. The six venues were City Winery, GALA Hispanic Theatre, Pearl Street Warehouse, The Kennedy Center, The Hamilton, and Union Stage. \nThe pilot has since been extended through Dec. 30 with no modifications made, except to add DC Improv and Comedy Club to the list of venues permitted to host live performances. However, City Winery and The Kennedy Center have shut down temporarily due to the continued impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn addition to the pilot, the District notified a handful of outdoor entertainment venues that had already submitted plans to resubmit plans for safe performances, according to a press release from mayors office.\nWhile the pilot program may allow certain venues to get a foothold, it has multiple limiting criteria: venues can’t host more than 50 people, including attendees, performers, staff, and others in the building; sites cant sell or distribute tickets in advance of an event; and they must place seats at least 30 feet from the stage during a live music event. \nThe pilot program also leaves musicians and venue owners excluded from it in a vulnerable position, such as the Pie Shop.\nAccording to Basanti, her business did not qualify for the pilot because of the stage separation restriction, which would not be possible given the size of her shop. The shop is not operating as a music venue and is solely offering curbside-pick up. \nBut even if the shop had qualified for the program, “it would be difficult for us or any venue to actually cover costs with the current restrictions let alone turn a profit,” Basanti wrote in an email to CNS. She added that she has yet to receive any updated guidelines for music venues from DC Health. \nWASHINGTON  The stage at the Pie Shop, a live music venue in the citys H Street corridor. (Photo courtesy of Sandra Basanti)\nIn September, a coalition of local music advocates, venue owners and festival organizers dubbed the “DMV Music Stakeholder Coalition” launched the Music Venue Relief Act, draft legislation that calls for the DC Council and Bowser to provide financial support for the District’s music venues, small restaurants and bars from October 2020 through May 2021. \nThe coalition warned that “if our administration and Council do not adopt a plan to allow venues to survive the next twelve months, a century’s legacy of history and culture stands to be wiped out completely.” \n“Venues dont have any support, many of them dont operate as restaurants, so they cant be making money off of food right now,” said Christopher Naoum, a coalition member and the founder of Listen Local First DC. “Every single venue that we lose is a huge blow to the community as a whole.” \nSince the launch of the proposed plan and its accompanying #SaveDCVenues campaign, more than 1,200 people have signed the draft legislation in support and hundreds have emailed the mayor, Naoum said. \nThe coalition proposes that music venues should be eligible for up to $15,000 per month in direct monetary aid, while small restaurants and bars, which on occasion host live music, should get up to $7,500 per month. The amount of money provided to venues would be determined by square footage and other factors.  \nOn Oct. 29, a majority of the City Council co-signed a letter urging Bowser to “identify and reallocate $4.5 million to provide no-interest, forgivable loans to assist small music venues in the District that are in danger of closing as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.” \nCouncilmember Brianne K. Nadeau also wrote to the DC Commission on the Arts and Humanities requesting it to use its capital project grants to aid venues. \n“It is critical that we maximize the funds the District already has to provide struggling venues with support at least through the next few months,” Nadeau wrote. \nBut according to Naoum, the effort to get funding from the citys arts commission failed. It remains unclear whether the Save our Venues Act legislation will materialize into funding or aid for venues. \nFor any aid to be disbursed, Bowser would need to introduce the legislation and permit emergency funding to be released because this years budget has already been set, according to Naoum. \nThe District’s fiscal year began on Oct. 1, but while the level of spending is set a year in advance, the citys budget is much like a family’s, according to the DC Fiscal Policy Institute, a nonprofit organization. In effect, expenses can be shifted and moved from one area to another. \nThe District also has an emergency and contingency reserve fund, which had $209.6 million as of June 30. These funds are used for “unanticipated and nonrecurring extraordinary needs of an emergency nature” and “nonrecurring or unforeseen needs that arise during the fiscal year,” according to a report by the citys chief financial officer. \nNeither the mayors office, the chief financial officer’s office, the Commission on the Arts and Humanities nor City Council Chairman Phil Mendelson responded to CNS requests for comment. \nWhile Naoum hopes for local aid, he fears that Bowser may be waiting on the disbursement of federal aid. \nIn July, Sens. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minnesota, and John Cornyn, R-Texas, introduced the Save Our Stages Act in the Senate, while Rep. Peter Welch, D-Vermont, introduced an identical bill in the House. The measure would provide grants for independent live-music venues affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The proposed legislation has seen no action in either chamber and there is almost no time left before Congress leaves for the holidays.\nWithout aid, venues of all sizes will be impacted, Naoum said. \nMore than 9​0% of independent venues that responded to a survey reported that they will close permanently in a few months without federal funding, according to a study updated last month by the National Independent Venue Association, a non-profit whose members include more than 2,900 independent live music venues and promoters from all 50 states and the District. \n“Everyone is hurting,” said Jon Weiss, Talent Buyer for Union Stage. “No one succeeds with a tiny capacity.” \nUnion Stage is a 450-capacity venue located in the Wharf. Weiss books events and fills the calendar for Union Stage, Miracle Theater, the Pie Shop, Pearl Street Warehouse and Capital Turnaround. \nWhile Union Stage is part of the Phase Two live entertainment pilot program, the few times it has been open with a limited capacity, it’s been more expensive than remaining closed, Weiss said. To survive, Union Stage has started hosting live-stream concerts, but the revenue gained from live-stream ticket sales barely keeps the venue afloat.\n“We’re talking peanuts, but it’s better than doing nothing,” said Weiss. \nBasanti said she has also had a hard time making ends meet. Before the pandemic, she struggled to keep prices manageable at the Pie Shop, while making enough to simply “keep the lights on,” she said.\nNow, Basanti is experiencing heightened difficulties. \nThe shop is the only source of income for herself, her husband and their two small children. She said she also has invested a lot of money into the shop and taken out a loan. \nBasanti said she currently has to pay approximately $50,000 a month in overhead costs, including rent, insurance, food costs, licensing fees and payroll.\n“This is it for us,” she said. “Weve dedicated everything to this place.” \nWhile getting financial aid through the Venues Relief Act would help her stay afloat, saving live music is bigger than the individual business owners, it’s an entire cultural and economic interconnected web, Basanti said. \nNot only is the music industry culturally ingrained in the local community, but it also employs sound engineers, bookers, promoters, bartenders and increases the city’s tourism.\n“Its bigger than just saving the venues right now in this moment of history,” Basanti said."

    "title": "Revised citizenship test is harder, more conservative and may worsen backlogs, experts say",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  The path to citizenship now may be harder as the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services implemented revisions to its naturalization test that went into effect Tuesday.\nIn one of the final moves culminating four years of controversial immigration policies under Donald Trump’s administration, the government is giving a new test that is lengthier, includes topics not covered previously and requires new applicants to correctly answer twice as many questions as the previous test.\n“It’s an awful, unfair, last-second change in a very sacred process,” said Eric Cohen, executive director of the Immigrant Legal Resource Center, an organization that advocates for rights for immigrants and racial justice.\n“This administration has, for the last nearly four years, tried everything in its power to keep immigrants from coming here legally,” Cohen said. “Once again (it) is trying to throw sand in the gears of any and all immigration processesmaking it harder for people to realize their dream of becoming naturalized citizens.”\nAlthough the passing benchmark for the citizenship test remains 60 percent, applicants will now have to answer 12 out of 20 questions correctly, compared to the previous requirement of 6 out of 10. However, applicants 65 years or older who have lived in the country with “lawful permanent resident status” for at least 20 years will be allowed to take the older version of the test, according to the USCIS.\nThe pool from which the set of questions will be chosen has also been expanded — from 100 to 128 — which means applicants will have to study more material.\n“It’s just a haphazard attempt to change the test for no reason at all,” Cohen said. “They claimed every 10 years it’s supposed to be changed, which is not true at all. There’s nothing like that in the regulations or in the laws. It’s all made up and lies, so it’s very frustrating then that they do this on their way out the door.”\nUSCIS declined Capital News Service’s request for a comment. But the agency said in its announcement that the revisions were made “as part of a decennial update to ensure that it remains an instrument that comprehensively assesses applicants’ knowledge of American history, government and civic values.”\nThe test is also more difficult in terms of language, Cohen and Nancy Newton, the program director of the citizen preparation program at Maryland’s Montgomery College, told CNS.\nThe new test has shifted from a high-beginning and low-intermediate level of English to a low-intermediate and high-intermediate level, and “it will certainly require highering of skills” of language learners who are applying, according to Newton.\nHowever, Newton said the feedback she received from her students who were a part of the pilot program in which the USCIS tested this revised test was that “generally they understood even if they didn’t have the answers.”\nNewton and her team are currently working “to change our curriculum and change our lesson plans to meet with the new content” of the test, which will be in place when new classes start in mid-January, she said.\nMontgomery College is one of only two citizenship preparation courses in the Maryland, Washington and northern Virginia region. The other course is offered at Baltimore City Community College.\nThe revised test does not include any questions regarding geography — there were previously about 18 questions. Newton said “about a quarter of the new questions are topics that we may have brushed upon butnot have gone in depth” as they weren’t on the old test, such as the Electoral College and the 1941 Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.\nIn addition to the new content, some questions have an ideological slant that is concerning, said Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, policy counsel at the American Immigration Council, a nonprofit and nonpartisan immigration advocacy group.\nReichlin-Melnick said he has “serious objection” to questions such as “Who does a U.S. Senator represent?” and “Who does a member of the House of Representatives represent?” The answers, according to the USCIS study guide, are citizens from their state or district, respectively.\n“This is not true,” Reichlin-Melnick said. “Members of Congress represent everyone who lives in their district andthis country has always relied on the principle that you dont have to be a citizen in order to be represented.”\n“However, the Trump administration has repeatedly pushed back against this basic idea of what it means to be represented,” he said.\nAnother question that displays “sort of a subtle bias towards a more conservative viewpoint” according to Reichlin-Melnick, is “What is the purpose of the 10th Amendment?” This is the only question about a constitutional amendment that does not have to do with voting rights or does not include an amendment as one of several possible answers, such as “the President can serve only two terms. Why?”\nNot asking about other amendments and “choosing only that one specific amendment raises eyebrows,” Reichlin-Melnick said. “The amendment is about states’ rights and that is a thing where conservative legal commentators believe the 10th Amendment is particularly important to this country.”\nIn addition to the added questions, increased difficulty and questionable content, one of the effects of these revisions could be worsened processing backlogs, which have already been impacted by the pandemic, experts told CNS.\nSince the questions being asked have doubled from 10 to 20, the interview process could take more time, which may mean that “they’re going to be able to interview fewer people every day,” Cohen said. That could lead to “long and longer delays for people trying to become a U.S. citizen,” Reichlin-Melnick said.\nThe current processing time for naturalization applications is 10 to 13 months in Baltimore and 11 to 15-and-a-half months in Washington, according to USCIS’s website.\nDue to the backlog and long processing times, the new administration of President Joe Biden could reverse Trump’s move before any applicant actually takes the test. But whether such a reversal will happen is unclear, Cohen said.\nChanging back to the old version of the test “is what (ILRC is) going to ask them to do,” Cohen said. “We certainly hope (they do) because that would be the right thing to do.”\nReichlin-Melnick held similar expectations from the incoming administration.\n“There’s nothing wrong with changing questions but it’s a matter of making the test more difficult and longer for no apparent reason, and I certainly would hope that a new administration would take a close look at reversing some of the changes that were made,” he said.\nThe revised test could deter some people. So might a nearly doubled application fee — from $640 to $1,170 — if it ever went into effect. The higher fee was set to take effect Oct. 19 but has been blocked by a federal district court in California.\n“There’s probably going to be some discouragement,” Cohen said. “But you’re talking about a really resilient group of people, immigrants who have gone through a lot worse than having a more difficult test.”"

    "title": "Police cameras disproportionately surveil nonwhite areas of DC and Baltimore, CNS finds",
    "content": "In parks, near grocery stores and schools, lining streets and at intersections, police-owned surveillance cameras in the District of Columbia and Baltimore disproportionately monitor majority nonwhite areas, most of which are predominantly Black, a Capital News Service analysis has found.\nThere are over two-and-a-half times more cameras in majority nonwhite areas, on average, than in majority white neighborhoods of the nation’s capital and Maryland’s largest city, according to a CNS examination of camera locations plotted over demographic information.\nIn both cities, around half of majority white areas had no cameras, compared to around one-fifth of majority nonwhite neighborhoods.\nThe racial differences in police camera surveillance illustrated by this data analysis “is sadly not surprising,” said Nassim Moshiree, policy director at the American Civil Liberties Union’s Washington office.\n“Most alarmingly, (the camera deployment) is contributing to the over-policing of Black and Brown communities,” Moshiree said. She added that concerns about such technology “should be viewed through the greater context of privacy risks that are inherent in the government’s use and expansion of mass surveillance.”\nThe Metropolitan Police Department maintained 264 closed-circuit television cameras throughout Washington’s neighborhoods as of Oct. 6.\nUsing demographic information from “clusters” of neighborhoods developed by the District’s Office of Planning, CNS found that the average majority white area had fewer than three cameras, while the average majority nonwhite area had more than seven.\nEach camera can pan 360 degrees and tilt 180 degrees, but cannot zoom, according to the Metropolitan Police’s website. Footage generally is kept for 90 days per legislation passed last year, but can be kept longer if it contains evidence of criminal activity, will be used for training or captures footage that could subject police to civil liability, according to a department memo.\nWhether the cameras are consistently monitored and whether they can be accessed or controlled outside of a centralized watch center remains unclear. Police officials did not answer questions from CNS about that issue. Likewise, the police did not respond to questions about image resolution of the cameras.\nThe area with the most cameras – 31 – includes Washington’s Congress Heights, Bellevue and Washington Highland. These neighborhoods are 95% Black and are among DC’s most impoverished regions, according to U.S. Census Bureau data.\n\nThe Baltimore Police Department maintains nearly 780 closed-circuit cameras throughout the city. CNS used areas designated by the City’s Department of Planning to find that, on average, there were over 16 cameras per majority nonwhite area, and around six per majority white area.\nThese cameras are monitored 24 hours a day every day and can pan, zoom and rotate and follow moving objects.\nBaltimore Police did not answer CNS questions about the cameras’ image resolution, whether cameras can be controlled or accessed outside of a centralized watch center, and what guidelines govern keeping footage longer than the department’s standard of 28 days.\n\nNeither the Baltimore police nor the Washington police commented on CNS’s findings. Both departments’ websites say they allocate cameras to high-crime areas. The violent crime rates in both cities are far higher than the national rate, especially in Black communities.\nResearch suggests that surveillance cameras may increase detection of previously underreported crimes. But research is conflicting and inconclusive regarding whether these cameras deter crime, especially violent crime.\nIn the District, “cameras alone did not appear to have an impact on crime,” and in Baltimore crime decreased in some areas but not in others following camera deployments, according to a 2011 Urban Institute study. In Baltimore’s Cherry Hill, crime slightly increased following camera installations, according to a 2018 study from the University of Central Arkansas.\nCherry Hill has 61 cameras, more than any region in Baltimore after the downtown area. It is nearly 90% Black and is among Baltimore’s poorest neighborhoods, according to census data.\nAlong with disproportionately surveilling people of color, the ACLU says there are additional ways in which cameras could be abused: for voyeuristic purposes, which has especially targeted women; for spying on or harassing political activists; and for criminal purposes (in 1997 a Washington police officer used surveillance databases in attempted blackmail of gay club patrons).\n“What there is a significant body of evidence for is that the proliferation of surveillance like CCTV can infringe on fundamental rights,” Moshiree said.\nBoth the District and Baltimore have spent millions of dollars on acquiring and maintaining the surveillance technology, according to media reports. Neither agency answered questions regarding the costs.\nDifferences in crime rates between racial groups can be largely accounted for by structural disadvantages, according to academic research.\nStructural disadvantages persist within the criminal justice system, too. Black and other nonwhite people are more likely to be stopped by the police, arrested, charged, convicted and imprisoned for the same crimes, the American Sociological Association reported. They are also more likely to be killed by police, according to a 2019 study published by the National Academy of Sciences.\nThe cameras are part of over-policing that targets minority communities, according to the ACLU.\nAnd over-policing actually leads to more crime by destabilizing communities, according to Lawrence Grandpre, director of research for Leaders of a Beautiful Struggle, a Baltimore-based think tank that advocates for improved living conditions for the city’s Black residents.\nLast year, an analysis of District arrest records from 2013-2017 “revealed a pattern of disproportionate arrests of Black people that persists across geographic areas and offense types,” the ACLU said in a report.\nA 2016 Department of Justice investigation of the Baltimore police found that its practices violated rights guaranteeing free expression and prohibiting unreasonable searches, along with federal anti-discrimination laws, and especially harmed Black communities. The police department later entered into a consent decree to address these issues.\n“Our Black communities have been over-policed or under-policed, never the right amount of community-based, community-driven, public safety approach policing,” Baltimore City Council President Brandon M. Scott said in an interview with CNS.\nScott said that he has heard some concerns about police cameras, but more often his constituents, particularly Black women, have asked for more cameras in their neighborhoods.\n“It’s more complicated than people think,” he said. “We’re talking about Black communities that have been stricken by gun violence for longer than I’ve been breathing… We have to be very careful that people don’t just paint the Black community in one way or another, and that we’re not this monolithic community.”\nGrandpre said many underserved communities, including Black communities, will choose more policing “because they have been conditioned through 50 years of austerity and racism that there is nothing, nothing that the people in power will invest in their communities except policing.”\n“So the important thing to do is… expose the insanity of that choice,” Grandpre said. “There’s an entire ecosystem of Indigenous and Black people… addressing the very issues that police are meant to solve, that inherently denaturalizes the assumption that the choice is more police or nothing.”\nInvestment in social programs consistently reduces crime, according to researchers from Harvard and Yale Universities. \nGrandpre said communities should also have control over their policing agencies to “establish legitimacy to police authority,” which he said currently works for a larger system of oppression rather than for the public, by prioritizing the protection of property for those in power at the expense of communities experiencing racism and poverty.\n“Crime is socially constructed in a way that it has now criminalized our lives,” said Tiffany Reid-Collazo, an attorney and member of the Total Liberation Collective, a group advocating for racial equality and freedom through community-building.\nCriminalizing certain experiences more likely to be had by impoverished people, like failure to pay fines, panhandling and certain drug use, often also targets people for race, according to an Institute for Policy Studies report.\n“To consistently look outside your window and to understand that you’re always being surveilled… there is not a safe space that lacks this access to Black bodies from policing,” Reid-Collazo said, adding that this has broad, harmful psychological impacts, as it can internalize feelings of oppression.\nWASHINGTON  A Metropolitan Police Department closed-circuit television camera at 15th and Downing Streets, N.E., in the nations capital. (Gracie Todd/ Capital News Service)\nLaura Moy, the director of Georgetown Law’s Communications and Technology Law Clinic, said: “The very presence of cameras in neighborhoods is going to change how people live their daily lives. It’s going to change who they meet with, what kind of activities they do maybe even how long they spend outside.”\nBaltimore and Washington police also have used various other surveillance tools, sometimes coordinated with federal agencies. Neither department answered questions regarding their possession or use of any surveillance technology.\n“They don’t tell us half of what they do,” David Grosso, at-large D.C. Council member, said of the Metropolitan Police, before adding that it offers less information than that. “It’s like pulling teeth.”\nGrosso said among surveillance technologies, “the thing that bothers me the most is these cell site simulators.”\nCell site simulators collect cell phone serial number and location information by acting as cell phone towers that many devices can connect to at once.\nBoth Washington and Baltimore police departments signed nondisclosure agreements with the FBI nearly 10 years ago to purchase and coordinate use of cell site simulators.\nPolice deploy cell site simulators in nonwhite areas more often than in white areas of Baltimore, according to a 2016 analysis by Electronic Frontier Foundation, a nonprofit digital rights group.\nFacial recognition technology, which has also been used by both agencies, disproportionately falsely identifies people of color, women, children and the elderly, according to findings last year by the National Institute of Standards and Technology.\nIn July, amidst massive protests against police violence and other racial injustices, Grosso introduced amendments to limit the Metropolitan Police Department’s use of facial recognition technology and temporarily ban its use of cell site simulators. The amendments did not pass, but Grosso said he plans to reintroduce them before his January 2021 departure from Council.\nGeorgetown’s Moy said when surveillance tools are used against activists “exercising their First Amendment rights to protest,” concerns regarding civil rights are exacerbated.\nIn 2015, Baltimore police used facial recognition and social media analytics to identify the locations of protesters demonstrating in response to Freddie Gray’s killing. That same year, the department requested the FBI’s help in monitoring protests via aerial surveillance.\nIn June, both the FBI, according to Buzzfeed, and the National Guard, according to the Pentagon, conducted aerial surveillance over demonstrations in the District, although the Metropolitan Police told Buzzfeed that it did not request the FBI’s help. FBI aircraft may be equipped with cell site simulators, according to the outlet.\nNeither Baltimore nor Washington police answered questions regarding surveillance of recent protests.\n“There’s no way that they’re not keeping tabs on all of us in some way, form or fashion,” said Arianna Evans, who was active in organizing protests against policing abuses this summer. “It just goes to show that we are getting under their skin.”\nMoshiree said she doesn’t know specifically how surveillance technologies “are likely being used” during protests, “but I think that’s exactly the problem.”\n“The public should have access to that,” Moshiree said. “If the government has access to a surveillance technology… that has the ability to infringe on your rights, then we should know the contexts in which they’re being used, how they’re being used, how the information is being kept secure.”"

    "title": "Biden readies sweeping policy shifts on COVID, economy, immigration and more",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  President-elect Joe Biden established himself on the campaign trail as the antonym to President Donald Trump when it came to key policy stances, promising strong responses to the coronavirus pandemic, climate change, criminal justice, immigration and health care.\n“Anyone who is responsible for that many deaths should not remain as president of the United States of America,” Biden said during the final debate about Trump’s mishandling of the pandemic that resulted in 239,000 deaths and counting.\nNow, as he plans for the opening days of his presidency, Biden has made the pandemic his top priority. In his acceptance speech on Saturday, he said “getting COVID under control,” is the key to winning the “battle for the soul of America.”\nBiden also has signaled that he will use his presidential powers on a number of fronts in his first days in the White House, according to multiple news organizations: he will reengage the United States with the world community on combating climate change and return to the Paris climate agreement, rejoin the World Health Organization, suspend temporarily deportations and repeal the ban on travel from many Muslim nations, protect against deportation the children of undocumented immigrants (the so-called Dreamers), and end a Trump ban against transgender people serving in the military.\nLegislation to provide additional economic relief to those impacted by the pandemic and policing reforms also are likely early priorities of the new administration.\n“The new administration will use every tool available to reverse the damage caused by the Trump administration and restore integrity, decency and empathy to America’s leadership at home and abroad,” Maryland Sen. Ben Cardin, a Democrat, said in a statement after Biden won.\nIn one of his first moves as president-elect, Biden announced the appointment of a Transition Covid-19 Advisory Board of public health experts, doctors and government officials, as the country crossed 10 million coronavirus infections.\nAccording to his campaign website, Biden also wants to establish a task force to examine the racial and ethnic disparities of the pandemic, and create a nationwide pandemic dashboard to look into local transmission rates by ZIP Codes.\nBiden also plans to double the number of drive-through testing sites — which stood at 8,413 as of Oct. 30, according to GoodRx, a company that provides health care information and some health care services. The new president also will use the Defense Production Act to produce more masks, face shields and other personal protective equipment, and revamp the testing and tracing process nationwide.\nHowever, Biden has said that the country should not be shut down — although Trump has repeatedly claimed that Biden would order a complete shutdown.\nInstead, Biden will look to “evidence-based guidance” from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to decide size restrictions for gatherings, when to open or close schools and businesses, and the steps necessary to make facilities safe.\nRichard E. Vatz, a professor of rhetoric and communication at Towson University, told Capital News Service he does not think that “there is anything (Biden) can change that will change much of the reality of COVID-19.”\nA COVID vaccine ultimately could return life in the United States to some level of normal and allow Biden to claim that his administration successfully mobilized and distributed the vaccine, Vatz said. On Monday, pharmaceutical company Pfizer Inc. announced that its vaccine is more than 90% effective.\nBiden will seek to expand healthcare coverage, and has said he will protect the Affordable Care Act and build on it, a task that may depend on the Supreme Court’s decision next year on the constitutionality of the law.\nWhile Republicans and Democrats failed to find a compromise before the election on additional stimulus measures, tax reforms and economic relief from the pandemic will be at the top of the Biden administration’s agenda, according to Peter Ubertaccio, dean of arts and sciences at Stonehill College in Massachusetts.\nBut a key obstacle may be a Republican-controlled Senate, which will be determined after two runoff elections in Georgia in January.\n“Were probably not going to get a lot of policy innovation through Congress over the next two years as long as there is a divided government,” Ubertaccio said.\nThomas Donohue, CEO of the United States Chamber of Commerce, said in a statement that “while there may be differences of opinion on how to best move forward, our nation must rally around the common cause of recovery. On this, there can be no divisionJob number one must be pandemic relief.  American small businesses cannot afford for Congress to wait another three months to act.”\nBiden’s approach will consist of the creation of a task force that reports to him twice daily, and a strategy to craft a new legislative package that would provide additional checks to qualified families, forgive a minimum of $10,000 per person on federal student loans, increase monthly Social Security checks by $200, provide emergency paid sick leave, and provide additional fiscal relief to states.\nOn his campaign website, Biden states that he will rebuild the middle class by investing in the nation’s infrastructure — such as highways, airports, railroads and public schools — and create and sustain “quality, middle-class jobs at home.” He specifically pinpoints union jobs.\nDonohue said “modernizing our infrastructure has broad support and can drive the growth and jobs we need now.”\n“If the Biden administration prioritizes something that can  and must  be done in a collaborative manner, it can set the tone for good governance on other priorities essential to rebuilding our economy,” he said.\nGabriel Winant, a labor and economics historian at the University of Chicago, said a Biden presidency might mean a more worker-friendly National Labor Relations Board.\nHowever, he cautioned that a legislative approach to progressive economic policy was probably dead on arrival in the event that Republicans maintain control of the Senate after the two Georgia contests.\n“The Republicans will not pass any version of labor law reform through the Senate. It simply won’t happen,” Winant said, adding that progressive change in the economic sphere might have to come from places other than Capitol Hill.\nWhen it comes to race-related issues, there will be an “immediate difference” in “tone and attention,” according to Ubertaccio.\nStill, some say Biden’s rhetoric is not different enough. The president-elect has been criticized for his response to Walter Wallace Jr.’s killing in Philadelphia, which included more words on “looting and the violence” than on the death of another Black man at the hands of police, critics said.\nHe was taken to task during the campaign for his help in drafting the 1994 Crime Bill, which increased incarceration rates, especially of Black men. Recently, he admitted that supporting the bill was a mistake.\n“The mistake came in terms of what the states did locally,” he said at a town hall hosted by ABC on Oct. 15. “What we did federallyit was all about the same time for the same crime.” But he repeated that still “it was a mistake” on his end.\nBiden’s plan to advance racial equity includes lowering barriers to homeownership for minority communities, supporting minority-owned small businesses, and ending pay discrimination.\nBy contrast, Trump never outlined a broad policy plan to address racial inequities, and has even questioned or denied whether systemic racism exists in the United States. But he has said more funding should go toward addressing racial disparities in health care, and he signed the First Step Act into law.\nThat law shortens mandatory minimum sentences for nonviolent drug offenses and retroactively applied the Fair Sentencing Act, which reduced the sentencing disparity between crack and powder cocaine offenses.\nTo address systemic racial and socioeconomic disparities specifically within the justice system, Biden has said he will establish another task force. He also plans to propose eliminating mandatory minimum sentences and the death penalty, ending cash bail, decriminalizing cannabis and ending incarceration for drug use.\nThe new president also wants to establish a grant program to encourage states to focus on prevention over incarceration, boost spending on public defenders, and invest in education and direct more federal money toward mental health disorders and substance abuse research and services.\n“President-elect Biden has the experience and empathy that our country needs in our commander-in-chief,” Maryland Rep. Anthony Brown, a member of the Congressional Black Caucus, said in a statement. “As the COVID-19 pandemic rages on, our economy struggles, climate change threatens our planet and we reckon with systemic racial inequality, the leadership of President-elect Biden will guide our country through these unprecedented times.”\nLast year, the Trump administration began implementing its policy barring transgender people from serving openly in the military. Biden has pledged to reverse Trump’s ban “on day one.”\nHowever, when it comes to defense and national security, there might be little difference between Trump and Biden, according to some observers\n“The expectation is that under Biden there would not be a significant change to the militarized status quo,” said Stephanie Savell, a senior research associate at Brown University’s Watson Institute of International and Public Affairs.\nThe military budget has grown under the Trump administration, and Savell said there “won’t be much of a change for that industry under Biden.”\nBiden has not clarified whether he would increase or decrease the defense budget, but instead has said he would make investments in technology and innovation.\nBoth the Trump administration and the Obama administration delivered historic amounts of missiles and bombs from aircraft in Afghanistan.\nThat type of warfare routinely has killed civilians in the Middle East, according to the Open Society Foundations, a philanthropic organization founded by billionaire George Soros.\nSavell said Biden will likely continue such airstrikes. But progressives hope Biden will keep his promise to end the war in Afghanistan, and to rely on diplomacy more than force.\nWhile Trump questioned climate change and downplayed science in general, including withdrawing from the Paris Climate Accord, Biden said he will rejoin the pact on his first day as president.\nBiden campaigned on creating a “100% clean energy economy” with a net of no emissions no later than 2050.\nIn the final presidential debate, Biden clarified after previous conflicting statements that he will not ban hydraulic fracturing, also known as fracking and said he does not support the Green New Deal. Both stances contradict Vice President-elect Kamala Harris’s positions.\nVatz said he does not believe that Harris’s more liberal ideology on multiple issues will lead to more progressive policies.\n“The question is, if Kamala Harris becomes president, would she be the classic example of a vice president who would want to adopt his presidents policies?” Vatz said. “She will be less of a force, in going more radical left, than people think.”\nBut some environmental organizations are enthusiastic about new White House leadership.\n“The politics of climate have changed and the success of the Biden-Harris campaign proves that the American people are demanding action on climate change  a clear mandate for all of our leaders to act on science,” a statement by Climate Power 2020 said. The group is run jointly by the Center for American Progress Action Fund, the League of Conservation Voters, and the Sierra Club.\nTrump’s highly controversial immigration policies also are targets for Biden reversals, especially the family separation policy, which took migrant children from their parents at the border and placed them in cages.\nOn Monday, it was discovered that parents of 666 migrant children — up from the initially reported number of 545 two weeks ago — cannot be found. Biden announced in a digital ad on Oct. 29 that if elected, he would form a task force to examine this issue and reunite families.\nBiden also has pledged that through executive orders he will reinstate the right of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrival recipients — commonly known as “Dreamers” — to remain legally in the country, as well as partly repeal the ban on travel from Muslim-majority countries.\nBut analysts say it may be more difficult for Biden to make change through legislation, with a divided country, a conservative-leaning Supreme Court, and the possibility of a Republican-controlled Senate.\nThroughout his campaign and in his victory speech, Biden has promised to reach across the political aisle.\n“To make progress, we must stop treating our opponents as our enemy,” Biden said Saturday night in WIlmington, Delaware. “Americans have called on us to marshal the forces of decency and the forces of fairness. To marshal the forces of science and the forces of hope in the great battles of our time.”\nHowever, while Biden’s moderate stances on climate change and other issues may appeal to congressional Democrats in swing states and districts, it may cause further divisions in his party.\n“I don’t know how open they’ll be,” progressive Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez told the New York Times concerning the Biden administration’s willingness to consider more left-leaning perspectives. “I think the transition period is going to indicate whether the administration is taking a more open and collaborative approach, or whether they’re taking a kind of icing-out approach.”"

    "title": "Joseph Robinette Biden, Jr., is elected 46th president of the United States",
    "content": "WASHINGTON — After more than three days of uncertainty in a closely contested race, former Vice President Joe Biden has defeated President Donald Trump to become the 46th president of the United States.\nCalifornia Sen. Kamala Harris also made history, as she will become the first woman — and first woman of color — to hold the vice-presidency. She is of Jamaican and Indian descent.\nAmerica, Im honored that you have chosen me to lead our great country, Biden tweeted just before noon Saturday. The work ahead of us will be hard, but I promise you this: I will be a president for all Americans  whether you voted for me or not. I will keep the faith that you have placed in me.\nAfter four days of waiting, news organizations declared Biden the winner late Saturday morning after new returns from his native state of Pennsylvania made it clear he would take the battleground and its 20 Electoral College votes, giving him 3 votes more than needed to make him president.\nThe president-elect, who turns 78 on Nov. 20, began his political career with narrow victories in Delaware and election to the United States Senate in 1972 weeks before he turned 30. He twice previously ran unsuccessfully for the presidency  in 1988 (ended after just three and a half months in 1987) and again in 2008. He will finally make it to the White House with another close win.\nHe amassed more votes than any other presidential candidate in American history, breaking the record that President Barack Obama set in 2008.\nHarris’s ascension to the vice presidency will be “really wonderful for the United States,” said William Spriggs, an economics professor at the Californian’s alma mater, Howard University, an historically black institution in Washington.\n“I think this will start a legacy that Americans will finally get used to the idea of women in leadership, and accept her role as setting the mark and paving a path for other women to ascend to top leadership,” Spriggs told Capital News Service.\n[ Maryland’s political battle lines continue to harden in 2020 ]\nHarris, 56, is a challenger-turned-ally of Biden. A rising progressive star, she attacked him during the primary for his opposition to busing to desegregate schools. She also set herself apart from the political veteran by embracing the Green New Deal and Medicare-for-All, as well as calling for a ban on fracking.\nHarris is expected to bring a more progressive perspective to the moderate president-elect’s agenda.\nWith the coronavirus pandemic raging across the nation, it appears unlikely that Biden and Harris would celebrate the start of their administration in the traditional manner that would call for an oath-taking ceremony Jan. 20 on the West Front of the United States Capitol, witnessed by massive crowds stretching for blocks on the National Mall.\nThe inauguration plans are to come, but Biden and Harris already have activated a website for the transition and are assembling a transition team. As a symbol of the coming change in power, the United States Secret Service earlier in the week dispatched additional agents to the Biden home in Wilmington, Delaware, and the Federal Aviation Administration designed the skies above that home as restricted airspace.\nDespite the pandemic — or many experts believe because of the various voting methods it made necessary — the total turnout for this election is expected to break a 120-year-old record.\nMichael Hanmer, research director for the University of Maryland’s Center for Democracy and Civil Engagement, said “motivational factors (to vote) were just more present” in this election, though voting law changes to accommodate the pandemic also played a part.\n[ Voters say they worry about the future, the pandemic, health care and socialism ]\nThe small margin of victory, combined with the overwhelming use of mail-in ballots, appeared to infuriate the president, as he continued to falsely claim that he was cheated out of reelection. Some of his Republican allies made similar unfounded attacks, while others in the GOP  mainly those out of office  denounced Trump’s accusations as dangerous and irresponsible.\nTrump had repeatedly questioned the legality of mail-in ballots and discouraged his supporters from voting by mail. As a result, mail-in ballots in many states with little history of using that voting method leaned very heavily to Biden.\nMany states counted mail-in ballots after tabulating Election Day ballots cast in-person, initially generating the appearance of a Republican surge in some of the battleground states. But the counting of the mail-in ballots  a slow process  began producing a Democratic counter-wave that materialized as early as Wednesday.\nMultiple networks — including ABC, NBC, MSNBC, and CBS — cut away almost at the start of a Trump speech in the White House Thursday night when the president leveled baseless and false claims about the vote counts.\n“If you count the legal votes, I easily win. If you count the illegal votes, they can try to steal the election from us,” Trump claimed.\nNo credible evidence of fraud has been produced, according to the Associated Press.\nThe president’s claims of cheating were “especially disconcerting because the dangers of Trump’s rhetoric will outlive his time in the office,” Peter Ubertaccio, dean of arts and sciences at Stonehill College in Massachusetts, told CNS.\nMillions of people believe Trump’s accusations of voter fraud despite no neutral observers stepping in to raise concerns about legitimacy, he said. This will, in turn, lead many citizens to believe that this election was stolen from Trump, Ubertaccio added.\n“On the list of dangerous things Donald Trump has done, this ranks pretty highly — he has basically called American elections illegitimate because they didnt go his way,” Ubertaccio said.\nWhile counting of votes continued, the Trump campaign filed lawsuits to stop the counts in Michigan, Georgia — where federal judges rejected them — and Pennsylvania.\nCaleb Jackson, a voting rights attorney at the nonpartisan Campaign Legal Center, called the lawsuits “absolutely frivolous and meritless” that “will not get them anywhere and not have an impact on the election.”\nIn states where mail-in ballots seemed to be benefitting Trump a bit more, such as Arizona, the president and his allies urged election officials to count every vote.\n“Of course its contradictory,” Jackson said. “Theres nothing legally that bars them from making those arguments, but, you know, professionally and ethicallyit goes against what you swear to do as an attorney.”\n[ Here’s why Maryland voters went to the polls on Election Day. ]\nIn states such as Pennsylvania and Georgia, automatic recounts will be generated if the margins are 0.5% or less. But recounts also can be requested by Trump’s team and were expected.\nGeorgia’s Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, a Republican, has announced Friday that there will be a recount in his state.\nBut Biden’s victory, especially given the closeness of this race, does not indicate that it would necessarily open the way for significant policy changes, Ubertaccio said.\n“We are a 50/50 country, and partisans on both sides have an active dislike of the folks on the other side,” said Ubertaccio. “Even landslide victories dont by themselves indicate long-term changes to American politics.”\nIf Republicans retain control of the Senate, which is not yet clear, Biden would have a hard time getting legislation to pass without the acquiescence of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky.\nWhile it was Biden who often negotiated with McConnell during the Obama years over budget deals and other legislation  both drawing on their long relationship with each other  the new president would be dealing with very different political dynamics after a hard-fought, divisive election.\nWith Senate races waiting to be called, the current makeup is even with 48 members projected to be on each side of the aisle, and two runoff elections in Georgia in January present the Democrats with an opportunity to take control of the chamber.\nEven so, it was the stark contrast between Bidens progressive agenda and Trump administration policies that helped drive turnout, Hanmer said.\n“Most people had a pretty good understanding of what they would get with Donald Trump if he were to win, and what they would get from Joe Biden if he were to win,” he added."

    "title": "As the nation awaits final presidential election results, Congress slowly takes shape",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  With all eyes on a closely-contested presidential race between President Donald Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden, many Americans may be overlooking the state of the battle for the Congress.\nI think we all know that how the top of the ticket does will reflect on the likely outcomes and scenarios for the Senate and the House, Sarah Walker, acting director of state and federal affairs for Secure Democracy, told Capital News Service.\nWhile there was no final call yet Thursday on who the next occupant of the Oval Office will be, in other key races the GOP was effectively defending its control of the Senate while Democratic Party hopes to greatly expand its House majority appeared to be fading.\nThe Democrats needed to flip four Republican Senate seats to regain control of the chamber after six years, but, as of noon Thursday, they had only managed to do so in two states and the GOP even managed to flip a Democratic seat.\nAs of Thursday the control of the Senate was even at 47, and it ultimately may come down to one — and possibly two — runoff elections in Georgia in January.\nDemocrats Mark Kelly of Arizona and John Hickenlooper of Colorado ousted Republican incumbents Sen. Martha McSally and Sen. Cory Gardner, respectively. However in Alabama, Republican Tommy Tuberville unseated the Democratic incumbent Sen. Doug Jones by a considerable margin.\nDespite bringing in $57 million in campaign donations in the final quarter, Democratic candidate Jaime Harrison was unable to defeat incumbent Sen. Lindsey Graham in South Carolina.\nSimilarly, in Maine, Democrat Sara Gideon repeatedly led polls and out-raised her opponent by $31 million in the third quarter, but Republican Sen. Susan Collins won reelection.\nRepublican incumbent Sen. Joni Ernst of Iowa also held on to her seat, after defeating Democrat Theresa Greenfield by a comfortable margin.\nGreenfield followed the Biden campaign’s lead by holding smaller in-person rallies, according to Timothy Hagle, professor of American Politics at the University of Iowa. This worked against her in an attempt to unseat Ernst, he told CNS.\n“In Iowa, we like to see our candidates in person,” Hagle said. “Thats partly because of the tradition of the caucuses, but its also something thats fairly regular in smaller states. As the incumbent, Ernst has had six years to get to know the communities in the state.”\nAt least one of Georgia’s two Senate races will advance to a runoff election in January, pitting Democratic candidate Raphael Warnock against incumbent Republican Sen. Kelly Loeffler, who beat third-place Republican candidate Doug Collins.\nWith ballots still being counted in the Peach State, it appeared possible as of Thursday that incumbent Republican Sen. David Purdue could also be forced into a runoff against Democratic challenger Jon Ossoff if neither breaks 50 percent of the total votes cast.\nWhether it is one or two contests in Georgia, the parties are expected to raise tens of millions of dollars in the high-stakes fight over Senate control.\nWhile Democrats hoped to expand their hold and recreate the 2018 surge in which they flipped the House, they only managed to take away two GOP seats, while Republicans added eight. However, ballot-counting continued Thursday and control of the chamber still favors Democrats 209-190.\nAdam Rapfogel, who works on polling for Democrats as an associate at Global Strategy Group, said the results did not indicate a turnout problem for Democrats.\n“It seems to me it’s a persuasion issue,” Rapfogel said, noting that Democratic margins in Florida’s Miami-Dade County and in the Rio Grande Valley of Texas showed Republicans had been able to make inroads with different kinds of Latino voters.\n“The Trump campaign spent some money well and turned down the racism on immigration towards the end,” Rapfogel said.\nSuch shifts towards Republicans in some cities and suburbs could make it harder for the Democratic Party to maintain a majority in the House of Representatives in 2022 or 2024, according to Rapfogel.\nFive Republican incumbents — Rep. French Hill of Arkansas’s 2nd District, Rep. Steve Chabot of Ohio’s 1st District, Rep. Ann Wagner of Missouri’s 2nd District, Rep. Donald Bacon of Nebraska’s 2nd District and Rep. Victoria Spartz of Indiana’s 5th District — will hold on to their once-endangered seats after beating their Democratic opponents.\nTexas’ 23rd District, a predominantly Hispanic district in the southwest region of the state that includes parts of San Antonio, will continue to be held by the GOP after Republican newcomer Tony Gonzales beat Democratic candidate Gina Ortiz Jones by a slim margin. Jones also lost in a close race in 2018 to Rep. William Hurd, who did not seek reelection.\nWhile the party split in both chambers may end up relatively the same, the 117th Congress will be more diverse on both sides of the aisle.\nRepublican Madison Cawthorn, 25, will soon replace New York Democrat Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez as the youngest member of Congress after winning North Carolina’s western 11th District.\nMissouri chose Democrat Cori Bush, a Black Lives Matter activist, as its first Black congresswoman to represent its 1st District, which includes St. Louis. She is also the first nurse and single mother to represent the state in Congress, Bush said in a victory speech Tuesday.\nIn New Mexico, voters elected Republican Yvette Herrell and Democrat Teresa Leger Fernandez, along with Democratic incumbent Rep. Deb Haaland, to become the first state to be represented in the House entirely by women of color.\nAfter landmark firsts on Tuesday, only three states remain that do not have any LGBTQ+ representation in their legislatures: Alaska, Louisiana and Mississippi, according to Out Magazine.\nRitchie Torres and Mondaire Jones, Democrats from New York, will both be the first openly gay Black men in Congress. They will represent the South Bronx as well as the suburbs north of New York City and parts of Westchester County, respectively. Torres will be the first openly gay Afro-Latino member.\nSimilarly, Democrat Torrey Harris of Memphis, and Republican Eddie Mannis of Knoxville, will join the Tennessee legislature as the first openly LGBTQ+ lawmakers in that state’s history.\nIn Oklahoma, Democrat Mauree Turner will become the nation’s first non-binary state legislator as well as the state’s first Muslim lawmaker. Although Oklahoma is a deeply Republican state, it’s 88th House District, where Turner won, includes Oklahoma City and leans Democratic. Turner uses both they and she pronouns, according to their Twitter profile.\nIn Kansas, Stephanie Byers became the first Native American transgender state lawmaker, while Sarah McBride’s victory in Delaware made her the first openly transgender state senator in the United States.\nAlphonso David, president of the Human Rights Campaign, where McBride was a former spokesperson, said in a statement that she brings the “kind of leadership that our nation urgently needs.”\nBut McBride, in a celebratory tweet Tuesday night, focused on the bigger picture: “I hope tonight shows an LGBTQ kid that our democracy is big enough for them, too.”\nDespite a major pandemic, the election broke many voter turnout records and led to some of the changes in Congress, Secure Democracy’s Walker told CNS.\n“We saw voters overwhelmingly choose new leaders to move us forward together toward a better future,” she said. “The people of America did not let anything get in the way of voting, and I believe they will not let anything get in the way of our votes being counted.”\nIn other notable decisions across the country, Colorado voters rejected prohibiting abortions after the 22-week mark of pregnancy, while Louisiana will add language to the state constitution that it does not provide protections against abortion restrictions.\nLegalized recreational use of marijuana was also adopted through similar referendums in four states — Arizona, Montana, New Jersey and South Dakota — bringing the total to 15 states.\nAdditionally, the District of Columbia voted to decriminalize psychedelic mushrooms, while Oregon became the first state to decriminalize hard drugs such as heroin and cocaine.\nIn California, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors  for the first time since the powerful board was created more than 150 years ago  will be composed entirely of women."

    "title": "Major campaign giving varies widely by race and geography in Maryland",
    "content": "Maryland residents donated over three times more to Democrats than to Republicans in federal races this year, according to data compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics.\nLarge donors across the country tended to be white, wealthy, and male, the Center said. Within Maryland, ZIP Codes with relatively high average incomes and lower rates of racial diversity gave more money, according to an analysis by Capital News Service that overlaid Federal Election Commission data released Oct. 22 with U.S. Census Bureau data.\n“That’s not reflective of what our democracy is,” said Emily Scarr, state director of the Maryland Public Interest Research Group. “Ideally, the donor demographics would look more similar to the community generally.”\nMontgomery County residents donated $23 million, around half of the state’s total contributions to federal races, according to the CNS analysis. No other county donated more than $3.5 million to federal elections in the 2019-2020 election cycle.\nMontgomery County is 20% Black, compared to 30% statewide. Montgomery also was one of the 20 wealthiest counties in the United States, according to a Fox Business report last year.\nWhen certain demographics or populations are overrepresented in the donor base, Scarr said, “our democracy is thrown out of whack.”\n!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var e in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var t=document.getElementById(\"datawrapper-chart-\"+e)||document.querySelector(\"iframe[src*='\"+e+\"']\");t&&(t.style.height=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][e]+\"px\")}}))}();\n\nThirteen Maryland counties gave more money to Republicans, while 11 gave more to Democrats. But those that gave to Democrats tended to contribute far more money.\n!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var e in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var t=document.getElementById(\"datawrapper-chart-\"+e)||document.querySelector(\"iframe[src*='\"+e+\"']\");t&&(t.style.height=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][e]+\"px\")}}))}();\n\nEven within counties, donations are often concentrated in certain areas, according to the CNS analysis of FEC and census data.\nFor example, residents in just one ZIP Code  20815 in Chevy Chase  gave over half of all contributions from Montgomery County. This ZIP Code is far whiter – 80.3% – than the county average, which is 60%, according to census figures. It also has a higher than county average median household income.\nNationally, former Vice President Joe Biden’s campaign and supporting outside groups have out-raised those of President Donald Trump, roughly $1.4 billion to $860 million, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. In Maryland, Biden’s advantage is roughly $27 million to $9.9 million, according to the CNS analysis.\nFive ZIP Codes in Maryland each gave over $1 million to the Biden campaign: Fulton in Howard County, and in Chevy Chase, Potomac and Bethesda in Montgomery County. The same Potomac ZIP Code was also among the state’s top areas contributing to the Trump campaign and supporting committees  a total of about $300,000.\nBaltimore County’s Lutherville-Timonium suburb, ZIP Code 21093, was another top Trump donor area, giving roughly $225,000 to the president’s campaign and supporting committees, compared to about $160,000 to Biden and affilkated groups from that same ZIP Code.\nOverall, however, Baltimore County and Baltimore City gave far more to Biden than to Trump, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Again, the ZIP Codes that contributed the most money overall in the Baltimore area were richer and whiter than their surroundings, according to census figures.\nCNS spoke to a major Biden donor in a pro-Trump area and a major Trump donor in a pro-Biden area about the geographical and political divides in Maryland.\nMiriam Zadek, 91, who lives in Baltimore County, gave more than $9,000 to Biden’s campaign and supporting committees during the 2020 election cycle. She said she couldn’t really comment on her neighbors’ political views.\nZadek, who received a Governor’s Service Award in 2017 from the State of Maryland for work setting up interpreting services for the deaf, said she supported Biden because she thought he would take a more reasonable approach to the COVID-19 pandemic than Trump. She felt the president’s response had written off seniors, leaving them to die.\n“I resent that now Trump assumes I do not count,” Zadek said. “We can’t leave states to fend for themselves. We need a reasoned approach.”\nZadek said she was delighted with Biden’s choice of California Sen. Kamala Harris as his running mate, and hopes that Biden, should he win, would have a Democratic majority in the Senate.\nMeanwhile, in the 20815 ZIP Code in Montgomery County’s Chevy Chase that gave millions more to Biden than to Trump, a top donor to the president’s re-election campaign and supporting committees said she felt isolated from her neighbors.\nCarol Greenwald, who heads Potomac Investment, gave roughly $13,000 to Trump and affiliated groups, according to FEC filings.\n“I actually do believe this is the most important election of my lifetime, and I’m 77 years old, so that’s saying a lot,” Greenwald said.\nGreenwald said her support for the president meant that many of her old friends no longer talk to her about politics. She said she felt her neighbors were so hostile to her political views that they wanted to eject her from her condominium’s health club for wearing a pro-Trump t-shirt.\nGreenwald came to Washington at the end of the Carter administration to head the National Consumer Cooperative Bank, after four years as a banking commissioner in Democratic Gov. Michael Dukakis’s administration in Massachusetts.\nShe said she felt the Democratic Party had left her behind after 9/11, and despite voting for Al Gore in 2000, was drawn towards the Republicans.\nGreenwald said she now considers the Democrats an existential threat to the nation.\n“I do believe that the Democrats have been taken over by a Marxist cohort,” Greenwald said. She alleged that proposals by some Democrats to add the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico as states, among other ideas, would spell the end of American democracy.\nMaryland PIRG’s Scarr said the concerns of wealthier donors have a disproportionate impact on national and state politics.\n“It’ll influence who is able to run for office, what issues make it onto the agenda, and ultimately, public policy,” Scarr said.\nThe Maryland PIRG advocates for campaign finance reform, pushing for small donor public financing at the local, state and federal levels.\nUnder MPIRG’s plan, public funds would match contributions under $200 at a ratio of roughly 6 to 1. For example, for a donor who gives $10, the candidate of choice would receive about $60. But there’s a caveat: the candidate must reject large contributions from corporations and outside groups.\nThe group has seen success already in Howard, Prince George’s, and Montgomery Counties, “where it’s definitely changed the donor demographics for the Montgomery County Council,” according to Scarr, making them closer to being representative of the county’s overall demographics."

    "content": "With record voter turnout, including a high volume of mail-in ballots, and mail delays expected, it is unclear whether we will know who the next president is on election night, experts say.\n“I’ve been expecting the unexpected,” said Michael Hanmer, research director at the Center for American Politics and Citizenship, a nonpartisan research center at the University of Maryland, College Park. “I think that’s the best way to work through this because there’s so many different possibilities.”\nHowever, Hanmer told Capital News Service it’s “pretty safe to say” that Democratic nominee Joe Biden is headed for a significant popular vote margin over President Donald Trump. But, similar to 2016, determining the next occupant of the Oval Office is going to come down to the Electoral College  and its possible this year that may not be settled until some days after Tuesday.\nAs of Friday morning, nearly 83.5 million early votes were already cast, of which nearly 54 million, or 64.6%, were mailed, according to the University of Florida’s United States Elections Project.\nBut in many states, including four of eight battleground states — Georgia, Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania — ballots are not allowed to be counted until Election Day.\n!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])f﻿or(var e in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var t=document.getElementById(\"datawrapper-chart-\"+e)||document.querySelector(\"iframe[src*='\"+e+\"']\");t&&(t.style.height=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][e]+\"px\")}}))}();\n\nTwenty-one states, plus the District of Columbia, accept ballots up to 17 days after Election Day. Of these, two are battleground states: Pennsylvania and North Carolina.\n!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var e in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var t=document.getElementById(\"datawrapper-chart-\"+e)||document.querySelector(\"iframe[src*='\"+e+\"']\");t&&(t.style.height=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][e]+\"px\")}}))}();\n\nNew York and Alaska, which accept mail-in ballots 7 and 10 days after Election Day, respectively, have said that they will not report “any mail votes on election night,” according to the New York Times.\nIn the battleground state of Michigan, Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson has estimated her count may be completed by Nov. 6, three days after Election Day. Pennsylvania, another battleground, may get the bulk of its votes tallied within a couple of days, according to Secretary of State Kathy Boockvar.\nBut the nation might not have to wait too long because “we’ll have a lot of information about a couple of really key states (on election night),” particularly Florida and Arizona, where mail-in ballots must be received by Election Day, Hanmer said.\n“That might allow us to project forward what’s going to happen in a definitive way,” he said.\n“I think really the only state that (Hilary) Clinton won (in 2016) that (Donald) Trump has a shot at is Nevada and it’s a relatively small number of electoral votes, so I don’t think Trump can win without Florida,” Hanmer he said.\nWhile a Biden win in Florida would suggest that he’s going to win in both popular and electoral votes, turning Arizona blue would not make results as clear, according to Hanmer. If Biden gets Arizona, it can foreshadow a national victory by a huge margin or a close race determined by few electoral votes for either candidate, he said.\nHowever, FiveThirtyEight’s presidential forecast predicts that if Biden wins Florida or Arizona, he has a 99% and 98% chance, respectively, for an Electoral College win.\nHanmer, who also is a government and politics professor at Maryland and an expert for MIT’s Election Data  Science Lab, expects that “we should know a good bit” about Georgia, which has an Election Day deadline for mail-in ballots, and North Carolina, as well.\nWhile North Carolina accepts ballots after Election Day, the state has seen a high volume of early voting. FiveThirtyEight’s founder Nate Silver reported that “it’s expected that as much as 80% of the vote there can be announced shortly after polls close.”\nIf those go to Biden, Hanmer predicts that the country won’t “have to worry as much about what the count is going to be in some of the states that are processing late because I think that will largely solidify things in terms of us having a clear winner.\nIf Biden wins Georgia, his chances for an electoral win is 99%, while grabbing North Carolina, pushes the probability over 99%, according to FiveThirtyEight’s presidential forecast.\nIn the case that Georgia and North Carolina do not go to Biden, Hanmer said “we might just have to wait until all the counting is done. Then the results can “really hinge” on Pennsylvania, where “we’re just not going to have solid information on what the result isfor a while because they can’t count or process their ballots until very late, he said.\nTrump has repeatedly called for final results to be called on election night, in part due to his distrust in mail-in voting  even though he did it himself this year.\n“Big problems and discrepancies with Mail In Ballots all over the USA. Must have final total on November 3rd,” he tweeted Monday night.\nThat kind of rhetoric is inappropriate, warned the National Council on Election Integrity, a bipartisan group of former elected officials.\n“Our Constitution and our state election laws require us to count every vote, including legally cast absentee votes,” the council said in a statement Wednesday. “Because of an unprecedented number of absentee ballots this year, counting every vote is not likely to be concluded on election night. In some states, thorough vote counting can last weeks, even in the best of times.”\nAlmost half of returned mail ballots in 19 states that report party registration data, including Arizona, Florida, Pennsylvania and North Carolina, were from registered Democrats, according to the Elections Project. On the other hand, 60% of Trump supporters told the Pew Research Center in late summer that they would rather vote in person on Election Day.\nOn election night, this could mean that in states that report mail-in ballots first, initial results may favor Biden. In places that report in-person, day-of votes first, such as most parts of Virginia, Trump may seem to have the lead.\nWhile this pattern in which ballots received post-election favor Democrats is well-established, Walter Shapiro, in an analysis for the Brennan Center for Justice, warns that the pandemic may disrupt this trend “since different demographic groups may be voting by mail.”\nIn key states, the Republican Party wants to prevent this “blue shift” while Democrats are relying on it. However, research reported by MIT News shows that historically, even “some of the biggest post-Election Day shifts” — the largest being 6.9% in 1968 towards George Wallace in Georgia — have not tipped the outcome of the election.\nYet both parties have fought over mail-in ballot deadlines in the Supreme Court, and such legal back-and-forth, which may continue after Election Day, could further delay results in critical states.\nLast week, the Supreme Court denied the Pennsylvania Republican Party’s request to reject ballots if received after Election Day. In a 4-4 decision, the court ruled that the battleground state can accept ballots if received within three days after Election Day. After the party asked the court to reconsider the decision, the justices let their earlier ruling stand.\nAlso on Wednesday, the Supreme Court backed a lower-court ruling and similarly allowed North Carolina to accept mail-in ballots up to nine days after Election Day, extending the deadline to Nov. 12.\nHowever, an attempt by Wisconsin Democrats to also extend the mail-in ballot deadline by three days to Nov. 6 was first accepted by a federal district court, but then blocked by an appeals court. The Supreme Court voted 5 to 3 on Monday to uphold the appeals court.\nAnother blow to Democrats came on Thursday when a federal appeals court struck down Minnesota’s plan to accept mail-in ballots up to seven days after election. The key state will now only be able to accept ballots received by 8 p.m. on Election Day.\nWhile states can continue contesting mail-in ballot deadlines and bring them to the Supreme Court — which Hanmer told CNS wouldn’t be surprising — “the court sent a pretty strong signal that changing things now, given how deep we are into the process, is unlikely,” he said.\nHe predicts that legal challenges after the election are “more likely,” and so are anger, disbelief and protests from supporters on both sides.\n“It seems very odd to say that about a presidential election in the United States, but there’s a lot of signals that suggests that large portions are not going to accept well the outcome either way,” Hanmer said.\n“What people do about that, I think, is a big unknown,” he said. “But it’s something we have to prepare for.”\nThe National Council on Election Integrity counseled patience and trust: “Every ballot cast in accordance with applicable laws must be counted — that’s the American way. All Americans, including the presidential candidates themselves, have a patriotic duty to be patient as election officials count the votes. Both candidates have a responsibility to remind the country that November 3 is the last day for votes to be cast — not the last day for votes to be counted.”"

    "title": "Maryland mail-in ballots at historic levels before Election Day",
    "content": "WASHINGTON — This year has been a parade of unprecedented events, and the early voting in the general election is proving to be no exception.\nThrough Thursday, more than 78 million Americans had voted. Of those early votes, more than 51 million — or approximately two-thirds — were mail ballots, according to the United States Elections Project at the University of Florida.\nThat showing is shattering records in many states with days to go until Election Day next Tuesday.\n“We’ve never held an election like this before,” Ralph Watkins of the League of Women’s Voters Voter Service Team told Capital News Service. “The number of applications for absentee ballots is hugeseveral, several times larger than it is in a normal year.”\nThe historic mail-based voting numbers are largely due to COVID-19 concerns, according to Natalie Scala, an associate professor and the director of the graduate programs in supply chain at Towson University’s College of Business and Economics.\n“I think a lot of people want a safe, effective, socially distanced way to vote,” Scala said.\nIn addition to voting in person on Tuesday, Maryland voters can also vote by mail, dropbox, or at early voting locations. Ballots delivered to dropboxes are considered mail-in ballots, according to State Board of Elections spokesman Dave Curley.\nThe Maryland State Board of Elections reported Thursday that 1,129,154 mail-in votes, which is approximately 67% of requested mail ballots, had been returned to date.\n“I think what’s nice in Maryland is that we’re not seeing the type of inadvertent voter suppression that’s happening in other states,” Scala said. “I’ll pick on Ohio, for example — one dropbox in every county right now. Same thing in Texas.”\nBy comparison, Maryland has set up 284 ballot dropbox locations across its 24 counties and county-equivalents for the 2020 general election as of Thursday, according to the elections board.\n!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var e in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var t=document.getElementById(\"datawrapper-chart-\"+e)||document.querySelector(\"iframe[src*='\"+e+\"']\");t&&(t.style.height=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][e]+\"px\")}}))}();\n\nAs a result, the return rate on ballots has been “insane,” said Michael Bayrd, the Maryland Democratic Party’s political and organizing director.\n“Things are moving in a very high, high pace,” Bayrd said.\nBayrd also pointed out the differences in return rates from county to county. County return rates varied between a low of 56.1% in Baltimore County and a high of 76.7% in Kent County, according to state elections data reported online Thursday.\n!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var e in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var t=document.getElementById(\"datawrapper-chart-\"+e)||document.querySelector(\"iframe[src*='\"+e+\"']\");t&&(t.style.height=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][e]+\"px\")}}))}();\n\nWhile Bayrd noted that these differences may be related to how convenient it is for a county’s residents to access their dropboxes, the LWV’s Watkins posed other theories.\nSmaller counties generally have fewer returned ballots than larger counties, so they may process ballots more slowly, as they have a less pressing workload, Watkins said. On the other hand, he added, smaller counties generally have fewer ballot styles, so they may be able to begin processing ballots earlier than larger counties, which generally have a multitude of ballot variations.\nGarrett County, with 29,000 residents living over nearly 650 square miles, boasted the second-highest return rate: 76% as of Thursday.\n“We’re a small county,” Garrett County Board of Elections Director Steven Fratz said. “But with that being said, we’re a small workforce — there’s only two people and myself in the office — but I think the county’s just always been close-knit. Y’know, people look out for each other… and we were very low in COVID until recently… and I just think there was a lot of push from the community to vote by mail.”\n\n\nThat said, there has been more of a push across Maryland for mail-in voting from Democrats than Republicans.\nAccording to the University of Florida data, as of Thursday, 69.9% of mail ballots returned and accepted in Maryland were from registered Democrats, compared to only 14.4% from registered Republicans.\nThis matches the overall national trend, according to Watkins.\nAt a national level, 50.3% of mail ballots returned and accepted were from registered Democrats, compared to only 25.9% from registered Republicans, the Elections Project reported.\n“I think that is in part by the president’s disparaging remarks about voting by mail,” Watkins said, referencing the myriad statements that The Washington Post Fact Checker’s Salvador Rizzo has dubbed  “(Donald) Trumps fusillade of falsehoods on mail voting.”\n“It angers Democrats and makes Republicans distrustful of mail-in ballots, and so I think that produces a change in voter behavior,” Watkins added.\nBayrd noted that the true turnout of Republican voters may not become apparent until Election Day itself.\n“Republicans don’t traditionally turnout earlier — or they don’t take advantage of early voting — they vote on Election Day,” Bayrd said.\nAccording to Scala, who has been conducting academic research on elections security for more than three years, mail-based voting is actually “quite secure” from attacks.\n“It’s very distributed, so that means there’s no real centralized location in mail-based voting,” Scala said. “There’s all these dropboxes, there’s all these mailboxes, and they’re spread out. So for something to go wrong in mail-based voting, from an attack perspective, every single mailbox, every single dropbox needs to be compromised to have a wide-scale, impactful threat. And in terms of a foreign adversary, that’s not of interest to them — it has a high risk and a low reward. So we do not anticipate a lot of issues there.”\nMail-based voting, Scala added, has not historically proved itself to be especially susceptible to fraud.\n“If something would happen, and someone tried to vote twice — or, you know, voted for, I don’t know, a dead person or something — we would find out about it,” Scala said. “There’s a lot of checks and balances in the voting process set up, especially in Maryland, that you would find out about it, and then that would be resolved.”\nThe Maryland Democratic Party is working to combat any lingering hesitation about voting this year. While the party has not been able to do in-person canvassing due to the pandemic, it has been actively engaged in phone banking and sending text messages.\nCNS’s attempts to reach Maryland GOP representatives through the Maryland Senate Republican Caucus, the office of Maryland Senator Michael J. Hough and the office of Maryland House of Delegates Minority Leader Nicholaus R. Kipke were unsuccessful.\nThe opening and counting of ballots began Oct. 1, but the results are to be embargoed until voting centers close on Election Day. At that point, results from early voting and mail-in ballots counted up to Election Day will be released. The results from in-person Election Day voting will follow shortly after that.\nHowever, “it is important to understand that, because the general election in Maryland is being conducted primarily by mail, a complete count of votes will not be available on Election Day,” Curley said in an email.\nWhile all mail-in votes need to be postmarked by next Tuesday to be accepted; as long as they have that proper postmark and the voter oath on the return envelope is signed, mail-in ballots will be accepted until Nov. 13.\nTime permitting, local boards of elections will notify voters who failed to sign their ballots so the voters can fix the issue, Curley said.\n“After Election Day, updated results will be released each day that ballots are counted,” Curley explained. “Not all counties may count ballots every day, but updates will be provided every day that ballots are counted.”\n“Counting of provisional ballots will start on the second Thursday after the election,” he wrote. “These results will be announced when they are counted.”\nIn the weeks to come, a final count in Maryland will take time, Watkins said.\n“We have never attempted to process such a huge volume of mail-in ballots before,” he said. “And although Im optimistic that a lot of people are going to vote early enough that the board of elections will have processed most of those before Election Day, I still expect theres going to be a large volume of ballots to be processed after Election Day, and we just need to be patient for those numbers to roll in.”"
